(Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Rodolfo Nin Novoa, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Eastern Republic of Uruguay.\r\nMr. Nin Novoa (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAs we greet all delegations, we also welcome the \r\nholding of the seventy-second session of the General \r\nAssembly. Uruguay is convinced that today more than \r\never we need to strengthen these bodies of international \r\ncoordination and leadership. Failure to do so would \r\nbe to abandon humankind to transnational powers \r\nthat escape regulation and arbitrarily impose their \r\nrule, notwithstanding the full validity of national \r\nsovereignties, which, throughout the course of history, \r\nhave shown great longevity and bravely responded to \r\nchallenges.\r\nBy instituting the reforms necessary to adapt its \r\nstructures and methodologies to a time that is very \r\ndifferent from the one in which it was born, the United \r\nNations should become stronger, and the General \r\nAssembly, its main body, should be given higher priority. \r\nThis would be a worthwhile endeavour, given that the \r\nAssembly is and will continue to be the expression of \r\na universal demos, which humankind must safeguard \r\nas the ideal for organizing peaceful coexistence on \r\na global scale, where all States, large and small, are \r\nequally worthy and respected.\r\nUruguay’s foreign policy has focused on certain \r\ntraditional pillars that have governed its actions \r\nthroughout history, such as democracy, the rule of law, \r\nrespect for and promotion of human rights, the defence \r\nof multilateralism, and the commitment to dialogue and \r\npeace. These are the principles that our country has \r\nhistorically defended and actively promoted. Uruguay \r\nhas made these pillars its State policy, supported \r\nby all its political parties regardless of the different \r\nideological or programmatic orientations that alternate \r\nbased on the rotation of power that is inherent to our \r\nidea of democracy. They represent a common heritage \r\nand a key chapter of the agreements entered into \r\nthroughout our history that define our national identity.\r\nToday, with the world facing a broad range of threats \r\nand challenges, Uruguay is resolved to make its voice \r\nheard and base its actions on the international stage on \r\nthose cornerstones that have held up its architecture in a \r\npeaceful and democratic manner. The increase in armed \r\nconflicts, characterized by unprecedented violence, \r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \r\nthe expansion in the trade of all types of weapons, \r\nthe spread of terrorism, cyberattacks, hunger and the \r\ndevastating effects of climate change make it more \r\nthan ever necessary for the international community to \r\nmake a strong commitment to addressing them.\r\nAt a time when many of these expressions of \r\nviolence and devastation are the result of global causes, \r\nit would be injudicious to strive to impose painful or \r\ninsufficiently local responses to such challenges. The \r\ninternational community must rise to the occasion, \r\nconsolidate its frameworks for joint action and \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Hundreds of thousands \r\nhave been killed and thousands of others injured, \r\nand millions of displaced persons have been forced \r\nto f lee their homes and risk their lives in search of \r\npeace. We should never consent to idly stand by when \r\nfaced with such tragedy and devastation, in the midst \r\nof an indifference out of which we are shaken only \r\nexceptionally, when a memorable image moves or \r\nstrikes us. Such an image — and this is the greatest \r\ntragedy — may be sadly representative of the fate of \r\ntens or hundreds of thousands of human beings whose \r\nlives and sad destinies we will never know. “Wasted \r\nlives” was how Polish philosopher Zygmunt Bauman, \r\nthe father of “liquid modernity”, described them in his \r\noutstanding essay. It is only right to recall here that the \r\nworld bade Bauman farewell earlier this year.\r\nUnfortunately, human trafficking networks, which \r\ntake advantage of human despair and vulnerability, \r\nemerge in those contexts, promising people a \r\nnon-existent future. In the face of this scourge, all \r\ncountries gathered here must redouble their efforts \r\nto combat all forms of trafficking, including human \r\ntrafficking. All States must cooperate in order to put \r\nan end to all such heinous practices, which denigrate \r\ntheir victims and strip them of their basic humanity in \r\nservice of the interests of global criminal and terrorist \r\nnetworks, and in order to promote the growth and social \r\ndevelopment of nations.\r\nLet us call a spade a spade: inequality remains \r\nthe main cause of most of the difficulties and threats \r\nthat we face. We all know that, with the current \r\nadvances in science and technology, poverty and \r\nhunger are unacceptable, and issues stemming from \r\npoor organization and the inequitable distribution of \r\npower and national and international resources are the \r\ncause of their unjustifiable persistence. For that reason, \r\nwe reiterate that the rule of law and development are \r\ninextricably linked and mutually reinforcing. Both are \r\ntherefore essential to sustainable development at the \r\nnational and international levels.\r\nUruguay fully endorse the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the commitment to leave \r\nno one behind. It pledges its unqualified support for \r\nthat commitment, without any preconditions. It is a \r\ncommitment that can be undertaken in a straightforward \r\nmanner by a country such as ours, which throughout \r\nits history has made the fight against abandonment one \r\nof the marks of its identity and succeeded in building, \r\nfrom a relatively early stage, a reasonably integrated \r\nsociety with a significant degree of social cohesion, \r\nalthough not without having to confront challenges and \r\ndifficulties.\r\nIn July, at the High-level Political Forum on \r\nSustainable Development, my country, for the second \r\nyear in a row, submitted its voluntary national report on \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which \r\ninvolved carrying out a regular process of consultations \r\nand interinstitutional coordination with the participation \r\nof the Government, academia, civil society, the private \r\nsector and international organizations, with respect \r\nto its implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals.\r\nHowever, there is an issue on the United \r\nNations agenda that is even more vital for \r\nUruguay — disarmament as a prelude to peace. The \r\ninternational community must be committed to actively \r\nseeking effective solutions to this global problem. The \r\ngrowing threat of terrorism and the challenge it poses \r\nto the international community as a whole, the risk \r\nof the potential use of weapons of mass destruction \r\nby terrorist groups, and the acquisition and use of \r\nconventional weapons and the links of such weapons \r\nwith transnational crime have made the failure to \r\ndisarm one of the greatest threats facing humankind. It \r\nis therefore a matter of deep concern. Controlling the \r\ninternational arms trade is an urgent necessity, given \r\nthat trafficking and arms deals with warring parties \r\nin conflicts contribute directly to the suffering and \r\nmurder of civilians.\r\nFor that reason, the accession to and ratification of \r\ninternational instruments intended to protect civilians, \r\nsuch as the historic Arms Trade Treaty, are a great \r\ncontribution to that end. And let me repeat here in the \r\nGeneral Assembly something that has already been \r\nmentioned in the Security Council. According to the \r\nStockholm International Peace Research Institute, \r\n74 per cent of the total volume of arms exports in \r\nthe period 2011-2015 was carried out specifically by \r\nthe five permanent members of the Security Council. \r\nSimilarly, military spending in 2016 was $1.69 trillion, \r\nwhich was higher than in 2015.\r\nWe should ask ourselves how many needs could \r\nhave been met had those funds been redirected to \r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 3/38\r\nthe economic and social development of countries. \r\nThe possession of nuclear weapons and the delay \r\nin disarmament by the States that possess them \r\nalso endanger and threaten the world’s stability \r\nand human security. If the proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons overtakes diplomacy, the consequences \r\nwill be devastating. Diplomacy, diplomacy and more \r\ndiplomacy: that is the path that we must take.\r\nThe use and threat of use of nuclear weapons \r\nconstitute a crime against humankind and a serious \r\nviolation of international law, including international \r\nhumanitarian law, as well as of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. The only guarantee against the use and threat \r\nof use of those weapons is their explicit prohibition and \r\ntotal elimination. Nevertheless, far from abandoning \r\ntheir weapons programmes, the nuclear Powers \r\ncontinue to improve and actively modernize their \r\nnuclear arsenals. Data from specialized organizations \r\nindicate that nine countries have more than 17,000 \r\nnuclear weapons, of which approximately 2,000 are on \r\nhigh alert, ready to be launched at a moment’s notice.\r\nUruguay welcomes the success of the United Nations \r\nconference that negotiated a binding instrument to ban \r\nnuclear weapons and bring about their total elimination. \r\nIt concluded with the adoption of the historic Treaty on \r\nthe Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, recently opened \r\nto all States for signature, and to which Uruguay has \r\njust acceded. In that regard, we call on all countries to \r\nsign the instrument, which aims to ensure a dignified \r\nlife for future generations and avoid a humanitarian \r\ncatastrophe.\r\nAs part of its concern about the development \r\nof nuclear weapons, Uruguay expresses its strong \r\ncondemnation of North Korea’s nuclear tests and \r\nballistic-missile launches and urges that country to \r\nabandon its existing nuclear programmes in a complete, \r\nverifiable and irreversible way, putting an immediate \r\nend to all related activities, including launches \r\nusing ballistic-missile technology, and other acts of \r\nprovocation.\r\nIn the same vein, we urge that country to respect \r\nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council and \r\nreturn to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, which it abandoned in 2003, and \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards \r\nregime. However, we also urge all countries, in \r\nparticular the great United States, to avoid the \r\nverbal escalations that have always preceded major \r\ntragedies throughout history and weigh every word in \r\na responsible manner, eschewing all violent rhetoric. \r\nA dynamic of antagonism often makes it impossible to \r\nstick to the facts.\r\nIn addressing the 3rd meeting of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session, our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. António Guterres, made reference to \r\n“sleepwalking our way to war”, inspired by the eloquent \r\ntitle recently used by the historian Christopher Clark to \r\ndescribe how human beings and nations marched into \r\nthe tragedy of the First World War, dazed and confused \r\nby mutual misunderstandings and unheeded warnings. \r\nWhen they became aware of the outcome, it was too \r\nlate.\r\nJust three months before ending its term as a \r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council, \r\nUruguay wishes to emphasize once again that it is firmly \r\nconvinced of the importance of focusing its efforts on \r\nprotecting civilian populations in all conflict zones \r\nby using different modalities, through peacekeeping \r\noperations and the delivery of humanitarian assistance, \r\nby, inter alia, protecting hospitals and medical personnel \r\nand denouncing f lagrant violations of human rights.\r\nIn the current context of crisis, we wish to \r\nacknowledge the bravery and altruism of humanitarian \r\npersonnel as they continue to assist, at the risk of their \r\nown lives, those in need in conflict situations. We \r\nunderstand that the best way to honour humanitarian \r\nworkers, who have saved thousands of lives in numerous \r\nsettings, is to devise successful policies and reach \r\nagreement within the framework of the United Nations \r\nto bring about the immediate cessation of attacks \r\non civilians, while making possible the delivery of \r\nhumanitarian assistance to those in conflict situations. \r\nWe are concerned at the increasing number of attacks \r\non and deliberate bombings of civilians, humanitarian \r\nworkers and civil infrastructure such as hospitals, \r\nschools and markets, all of which are serious human \r\nrights violations.\r\nThe ultimate atrocity is when defenceless human \r\nbeings are attacked while they are assisting other \r\ndefenceless human beings at the worst times and in the \r\nworst places. Not only should we emphatically condemn \r\nthis, but we should also adopt resolutions to protect \r\nvictims and bring perpetrators to justice. Uruguay \r\nonce again calls for full compliance with Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, especially resolution 2286 (2016), \r\nand the establishment of effective mechanisms for its \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n4/38 17-29852\r\nimplementation. I wish to reiterate that this kind of \r\nattack against civilian targets, disguised as collateral \r\nattacks, should never be tolerated.\r\nIt is undeniable that we are experiencing deep-\r\nseated changes in the kinds of conflicts we are seeing. \r\nThe increasing presence of terrorist organizations and \r\nnon-State actors spreads fear among populations and \r\ndisproportionately undermines the rights of women and \r\nchildren. History has shown us that there is a constant \r\npattern in terms of conflicts in the world, regardless \r\nof region or religion. Women and girls are those who \r\nsuffer the consequences most. War invades their lives, \r\nthreatening their sense of security.\r\nIn this context, as an elected member of the Security \r\nCouncil, a country with a long-standing participation \r\nin various peacekeeping operations and an active \r\ntroop contributor, Uruguay is intent on fighting sexual \r\nexploitation and abuse in armed conflicts. We are deeply \r\ncommitted to the zero-tolerance policy. We reiterate \r\nour support for this policy and are working very hard to \r\nprevent new cases of abuse and sexual exploitation in \r\npeacekeeping operations, with the understanding that a \r\nsingle case is one too many.\r\nFor more than 50 years, Uruguay knew what it was \r\nlike to be outside the most important decision-making \r\nbody in the world. That is why we believe it is vital that \r\nthe issues taken up by the Security Council be public \r\nknowledge for all Members of the United Nations. \r\nWhat is discussed there is of such importance that \r\nall States present here today should be aware of what \r\ngoes on behind closed doors. That is why Uruguay \r\nwill continue working towards more transparent and \r\ninclusive working methods in the United Nations \r\nwithin the framework of the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency group, as well as in other multilateral \r\ncontexts. As a signatory to the Charter of the United \r\nNations, Uruguay emphasizes its commitment to the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations while \r\ncommitting itself to working tirelessly to sustain those \r\nprinciples, which we believe are vital for building a \r\nsafer and more prosperous future.\r\nWe cannot even think of peace in the world if \r\nthe international community does not make a serious \r\ncommitment to disarmament and non-proliferation. Any \r\nprogress in disarmament and non-proliferation — be it \r\nserious commitments; gradual, effective, specific steps \r\nforward; or results — must be welcomed and celebrated \r\nas a tremendous achievement of the United Nations.\r\nWe wish to conclude our statement by highlighting \r\nthe overarching historical significance of the peace \r\nprocess that has been gaining ground in Colombia and \r\nputting an end to the armed conflicts that divided it, \r\ndrowning it in pain and blood for many long decades. \r\nAs Uruguayans, as Latin Americans and, in this case, \r\nas the then President of the Security Council, we are \r\npleased and proud to have made a modest contribution \r\nto the building of peace in Colombia. This is the best \r\nexample we have when we talk about specific results.\r\nIt is our Latin America that we have made a region \r\nof peace today. The great note of hope that has sounded \r\nwhen this ceasefire and the peace agreement were \r\nreached gives us the enthusiasm we need to take on the \r\nnew and difficult missions in other parts of the world \r\nin which the way out often seems difficult to see. Latin \r\nAmerica has single-mindedly rejected all attempts to \r\nresolve internal conflicts in Latin America, no matter \r\nhow intense they are, through military intervention.\r\nIn the historical experience of our continent, such \r\ninterventions have only left a trail of lasting violence, \r\npoverty and instability. Latin America is united \r\nas a block against interventionist war-mongering \r\nendeavours that are neither rational nor prudent.\r\nI would like to reiterate once again our emphatic \r\nrejection of the unfair blockade which, after 55 years, is \r\nstill looming over our sister Republic of Cuba, and we \r\nexpress our sympathy and condolences in connection \r\nwith the victims of the hurricanes and earthquakes that \r\nrecently affected the region.\r\nIn conclusion, achieving a sustainable planet and \r\na decent life requires the effective use of existing \r\nresources so that we can live in peace and security \r\nand our legacy can be a habitable world for future \r\ngenerations.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nArchbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, Secretary for \r\nRelations with States of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Gallagher (Holy See): On behalf of \r\nHis Holiness Pope Francis, I am pleased to congratulate \r\nYour Excellency on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session and \r\nto commend you on the choice of the theme for the \r\ngeneral debate: “Focusing on people: Striving for \r\npeace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet.” \r\nIt is a congenial topic for the Holy See. Pope Francis \r\nnever tires of insisting on people first, especially those \r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 5/38\r\nwho suffer, those who are excluded, marginalized or \r\nleft behind.\r\nThe Catholic Church expresses the meaning of \r\nfocusing on people in these words: the joys and the \r\nhopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men and \r\nwomen of this age, especially those who are poor or in \r\nany way aff licted are the joys and hopes, the griefs and \r\nanxieties of the followers of Christ, because, indeed, \r\nnothing genuinely human fails to raise an echo in our \r\nhearts. Focusing on people means not only protecting \r\nthem from heinous crimes, but also placing them ahead \r\nof all national and geopolitical interests and fulfilling \r\nall the international political commitments undertaken \r\nthroughout the history of the United Nations relating to \r\nsocial and economic development, starting with those \r\nset forth in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nAlways putting people first means protecting, at \r\nevery stage and in every circumstance, the dignity of \r\nthe person, human rights, fundamental freedoms and, \r\nin a specific way, the rights to life and to freedom of \r\nreligion, from which all other rights f low. These two \r\nhuman rights are the common foundation of the pillars \r\nof peace, security and integral human development. \r\nThey are indivisible from those other rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms relating to a dignified, spiritual, \r\nmaterial and intellectual life for all citizens and their \r\nfamilies, including, inter alia, the right to food, water, \r\nhousing, a safe environment and work.\r\nWith the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the \r\ninternational community committed itself to effective \r\nmeasures to eradicate the root causes of various evils \r\nand indignities that many people in the world are facing \r\ntoday. Moments before the Assembly adopted the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. Pope Francis \r\ndefined the Agenda as an important sign of hope. One \r\nof the fundamental reasons for this hope is that world \r\nleaders had agreed on a plan of action for people, planet \r\nand prosperity and were determined to end poverty and \r\nhunger in all their forms and manifestations and to \r\nensure that all human beings could fulfil their potential \r\nin dignity and equality and in a healthy environment. \r\nTheir common resolve to leave no one behind articulates \r\nthe core of this focus on people.\r\nWith regard to political commitments, Pope Francis \r\nhas also urged the Organization and the international \r\ncommunity not to fall into what could be called \r\n“declarationist nominalism”. Accordingly, we must \r\nguard against having soothed consciences and feeling \r\ngood simply because we adopted the 2030 Agenda and \r\nother important international accords. On the contrary, \r\nwe must not rest until our legal commitments have been \r\ntruly fulfilled and our political promises kept when it \r\ncomes to the lives of people. We must therefore take a \r\nhard and honest look at the principal challenges that \r\nthe peoples of the world are facing today and will face \r\ntomorrow. With this in mind, responsible compliance \r\nwith the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change and the Paris Agreement, as well as \r\nthe implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda \r\nand the 2030 Agenda, could be a way of focusing all \r\ncountries and international organizations on working \r\ntogether for peace, setting aside the dangerous game of \r\nexchanging threats.\r\nFrom this perspective, the Holy See sees the \r\nforthcoming reform and fine-tuning of the United \r\nNations development system as an additional \r\nopportunity for placing people and their needs at the \r\ncentre of our action. In so doing so, as Pope Francis \r\nreminded us in this Hall two years ago, we must allow \r\nthem to be dignified agents of their own destiny (see \r\nA/70/PV.3).\r\nChristian churches, in particular the Orthodox and \r\nCatholic Churches, celebrate together on 1 September \r\nthe World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation to \r\nheighten public awareness of their shared responsibility \r\nto take care of our common home and contribute to \r\nreversing environmental degradation. To mark the \r\nWorld Day of Prayer this year, Pope Francis and the \r\nEcumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I released a joint \r\nmessage affirming that the Earth was entrusted to us \r\nas a sublime gift and legacy for which all of us share \r\nresponsibility. Our human dignity and welfare are \r\ndeeply connected to our care for the whole of creation.\r\nThis call for responsible stewardship finds \r\nparticular urgency before the deteriorating conditions \r\nof our common home and an often purely utilitarian \r\nworld view concerning the things that surround us. \r\nAny harm done to the environment is harm done \r\nto humankind today and tomorrow. Therefore, the \r\nmisuse and destruction of the environment are also \r\naccompanied by a relentless process of exclusion, \r\ngiven that the deterioration of the planet affects, first \r\nand foremost, the many billions trapped in poverty or \r\nin conditions of environmental stress across the globe. \r\nThis dramatic reality of exclusion and inequality must \r\nlead all of us to take stock of our shared and individual \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n6/38 17-29852\r\nresponsibilities. The pressing call and challenge to care \r\nfor creation invite all humankind to work unhesitatingly \r\ntowards sustainable and integral development.\r\nImproving climate conditions and the natural \r\nenvironment is possible only if we accept the need to \r\nchange the way we perceive the world and thus our \r\nway of relating to it. Although our common home is \r\nfalling into serious disrepair, we can reverse the trend \r\nof environmental degradation. Indeed, as Pope Francis \r\nemphasized in his encyclical Laudato si’, while we are \r\ncapable of the worst, we are also capable of the best, \r\nrising above ourselves, choosing again what is good \r\nand making a new start.\r\nThe duty to prevent wars and violent conflicts is an \r\nessential component of the responsibility to protect. The \r\nHoly See therefore appreciates the Secretary-General’s \r\nexplicit and strong emphasis on preventive diplomacy \r\nand concurs with his assessment that the most serious \r\nshortcoming of the entire international community \r\nis the frequent inability to prevent crises. Prevention \r\nrequires, first of all, restoring faith in the capacity of \r\nhumankind for dialogue. An environment of trust is \r\nurgently needed. All countries should take a decisive and \r\nurgent step back from the present escalation of military \r\npreparations. The largest countries and those that have \r\na stronger tradition of respecting human rights should \r\nbe the first to perform generous actions of pacification. \r\nAll diplomatic and political means of mediation should \r\nbe engaged in order to avoid the unspeakable.\r\nAllow me to recall the appeal of Pope Pius XII to \r\nall nations on 24 August 1939, on the eve of the Second \r\nWorld War:\r\n“The way of justice is promoted by the strength \r\nof reason and not with the force of arms... The \r\ndanger is imminent, but there is still time. Nothing \r\nis lost with peace. With war, everything is lost. \r\nMay people come back to understand each other \r\nand take up again negotiations. By negotiating with \r\ngood will and with respect for mutual rights, they \r\nwill realize that sincere and active negotiations \r\nnever preclude an honourable success.”\r\nIn such a context, I would like to recall that a dozen \r\nyears have passed since the historica gathering of \r\nworld leaders in this Hall for the 2005 World Summit. \r\nFocusing on people, the Heads of State and Government \r\nof the Members of the Organization reached consensus \r\non the responsibility to protect populations from \r\ngenocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. There is no doubt that a collective \r\npolitical consensus is necessary, but a ref lection on \r\nArticles 2, paragraph 7 and 39 of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations is also needed.\r\nThe Holy See therefore supports all initiatives \r\ndesigned to facilitate observing obligations under the \r\nresponsibility to protect, but it would like to remind \r\nthe international community once again that without a \r\nlegal framework or fair respect of the international rule \r\nof law, the application of the principle is unfeasible.\r\nThe war in Yemen is causing a humanitarian \r\ncatastrophe of apocalyptic proportions. The tragedy \r\nstemming from the war in Syria continues to grow \r\nevery day. Involved stakeholders should sit at the United \r\nNations negotiating table with the sole precondition \r\nthat human rights law and principles be respected and \r\nthat humanitarian access and assistance be allowed. \r\nAt the same time, States, especially those that at some \r\ntime in recent history have been directly or indirectly \r\ninvolved in the conflict, must undertake all means to \r\nreach a ceasefire, which is a first step towards peace.\r\nThe Holy See is particularly concerned about the \r\npolitical divisions and instability in Venezuela and \r\nits humanitarian crisis. In addition, the international \r\ncommunity must address the complex political and \r\ndiplomatic tensions in the Arabian peninsula, as well \r\nas the violence and the various humanitarian situations \r\nin the Middle East. We must all strive for an end to \r\nviolence and for reaching a solution that can enable \r\nboth Palestinians and Israelis alike to live at last in \r\npeace within clearly established and internationally \r\nrecognized borders, thus implementing the two-\r\nState solution.\r\nThe ongoing violence and intense political \r\ntension in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nnecessitate an urgent and efficient commitment from \r\nall parties to finding a solution to the constitutional \r\ncrisis. Furthermore, there is a need for greater public \r\nawareness of certain ongoing conflict situations with \r\na view to reaching negotiated and peaceful solutions \r\nto them, especially in Ukraine, South Sudan and the \r\nCentral African Republic, inter alia.\r\nAlong the same lines, as Pope Francis has stated, \r\nthere is\r\n“another kind of conflict that is not always so \r\nexplicit and yet is silently killing millions of people. \r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 7/38\r\nMany of our societies experience a different kind of \r\nwar as a result of the drug trade” (A/70/PV.3, p. 6).\r\nThe drug trade has joined other forms of corruption \r\nand has\r\n“penetrated into every level of life — social, \r\npolitical, military, artistic and religious — and in \r\nmany cases has given rise to a parallel structure \r\nthat threatens the credibility of our institutions” \r\n(ibid).\r\nIn a similar vein, the Holy See is concerned with \r\nthe challenges of fighting corruption and terrorism \r\nand with promoting stable peace and a sustainable \r\ndevelopment in many countries of the world. The \r\nHoly See wishes to stress again that terrorism can be \r\ncountered only by more cohesive and coherent measures \r\nat the international level: as terror knows no border, the \r\ninternational community must act as a whole.\r\nThe full protection of people is possible only with \r\na durable peace. However, the protection of civilian \r\npopulations must also be ensured during times of war \r\nThe recent gangrenous conflicts both weaken and reveal \r\nthe shortcomings of the international order and cause \r\ninexplicable suffering, massive displacements, blatant \r\nviolations of universal human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms and extreme poverty. There is no worse man-\r\nmade crisis than violent conflicts. They drive people \r\nforcibly to migrate or become refugees. They engender \r\nmass atrocities and crimes against humanity. Indeed, as \r\nPope Francis told the Assembly, “War is the negation of \r\nall rights” (ibid., p. 5).\r\nThe lamentable situation of the hundreds of \r\nmillions of migrants and refugees f leeing from wars, \r\npersecution, natural disasters and extreme poverty, \r\nparticularly in Nigeria, Myanmar, Somalia and \r\ncountries of the sub-Saharan region, inter alia, is a \r\ngreat responsibility for all without exception.\r\nOur common humanity compels us all, as Pope \r\nFrancis has proposed, to welcome, protect, promote and \r\nintegrate those who f lee from such adverse conditions. \r\nThese four actions are based on the proposition that \r\nmigrants, despite many real or imagined challenges, are \r\ngood for society, and on the principle of solidarity with \r\nthose in need. In particular, they express our shared \r\nresponsibility towards the victims of the genocide, \r\nwar crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against \r\nhumanity that the international community has failed \r\nto prevent or stop, in blatant neglect of the principles of \r\ninternational law.\r\nThe Holy See will vigorously work to see these four \r\nconcepts enshrined and reflected in the future Global \r\nCompact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration \r\nand the Global Compact on Refugees. The Holy See \r\nbelieves that these United Nations-led processes \r\noffer a unique opportunity to respond collectively to \r\nchallenges through international cooperation and shared \r\nresponsibility. The Holy See urges the international \r\ncommunity to overcome the current political impasse \r\nand go beyond the negative sentiments that we face \r\nin opening safe, orderly and regular pathways for \r\nmigration. In order to achieve the desired outcome, \r\nthe contribution of political communities, civil society \r\nand all stakeholders is indispensable, each according to \r\ntheir respective responsibilities.\r\nWhile some migrants may be motivated by the \r\nlegitimate desire to improve their already acceptable \r\nsituations, most would likely choose not to migrate \r\nif they enjoyed peace and economic security in their \r\nhome countries. It is a basic human right to live in \r\none’s own country, but that right is effective only if \r\nthe root causes that force people to migrate, such as \r\nwars and conflicts, mass atrocities and persecutions, \r\nand dire economic and environmental hardships, are \r\nmet with adequate solutions. Indeed, if basic necessary \r\nconditions were met, people would not feel forced to \r\nleave their homes, making migration manageable and \r\nvoluntary. The focus in negotiating the Compacts \r\ntherefore should not be limited to stopping migrants in \r\ntheir tracks or confining refugees to camps, but, instead, \r\nit should address the causes that deprive them of living \r\nwith dignity and force them to make life-threatening \r\njourneys. This should be our goal, and it should be a \r\nkey part of the Global Compact for Migration.\r\nAnother great challenge facing the international \r\ncommunity is trafficking in persons. At the root of \r\nthis and other contemporary forms of slavery are wars \r\nand conflicts, extreme poverty, underdevelopment \r\nand exclusion, lack of education or employment \r\nopportunities and environmental catastrophes. \r\nBut we ought to recognize that on the demand side \r\nof such criminal trafficking there is also a crass \r\nselfishness that reaches the unimaginable heights of \r\nmoral irresponsibility in the case of the trafficking of \r\nchildren, organs, tissues and embryos and in so-called \r\ntransplant tourism. Such execrable forms of trade \r\nare exacerbated by corruption on the part of public \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n8/38 17-29852\r\nofficials and common people willing to do anything \r\nfor financial gain. Indeed, the migration and refugee \r\ncrises are today facilitating an increase in trafficking \r\nin persons and other contemporary forms of slavery.\r\nThe Holy See and the Catholic Church have long \r\nspoken out against the evil of trafficking in persons \r\nand, through the dedicated work of so many individuals \r\nand institutions, have sought to fight its root causes, \r\ncare for the victims, raise awareness about this scourge \r\nand work with anyone and everyone to try to eliminate \r\nit. In an address on 10 April 2014, at the International \r\nConference on Combating Human Trafficking, Pope \r\nFrancis called trafficking in persons an “open wound \r\non the body of contemporary society” and at the \r\nsigning of the Universal Declaration Against Slavery, \r\non 2 December 2014, he termed it an “atrocious scourge \r\nthat is present throughout the world on a broad scale”.\r\nAt the heart of this evil is the utter loss of respect \r\nfor human dignity and the total indifference to the \r\nsufferings of fellow human beings. Modern slavery \r\nhappens when people are treated as objects, which \r\nleads to their being deceived, raped, often sold and \r\nresold for various purposes, and in the end either killed \r\nor left devastated in mind and body, only to be finally \r\nthrown away or abandoned. By refocusing its attention \r\non people and putting people first in its overall work, \r\nthe Organization should unerringly support the fight \r\nagainst trafficking in persons and other contemporary \r\nforms of slavery.\r\nPope Francis calls on everyone, and especially \r\nthe competent authorities, to address this heinous \r\ncrime through effective legal instruments, punish \r\nthose who benefit from it, assist in the healing and \r\nthe reintegration of its victims and eradicate its root \r\ncauses. Our response must be commensurate with this \r\ngreat evil of our time.\r\nThe world is awash in all types of weapons, from \r\nnuclear weapons to small arms and light weapons. The \r\narms trade, both licit and illicit, keeps on growing. \r\nThe proliferation of arms, including weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, among terrorist groups and other non-State \r\nactors has become a real danger. These trends are \r\ndeeply worrying, but more disturbing still is the deep \r\nchasm that separates commitments made from actions \r\ntaken in the field of disarmament and arms control. \r\nWhile everyone condemns the grave effects of arms \r\nproliferation, nothing has substantially changed on the \r\nground, because, as Pope Francis has observed,\r\n“[W]e say the words ‘no more war!’, but at the same \r\ntime we manufacture weapons and sell them ... to \r\nthose who are at war with one another”.\r\nThis must change. The proliferation of weapons \r\nsimply aggravates situations of conflict and results \r\nin unimaginable human suffering and material costs, \r\nprofoundly undermining development, human rights \r\nand the search for lasting peace. Without greater \r\ninternational and regional cooperation, especially \r\namong weapon-producing States, in terms of strictly \r\ncontrolling and limiting the production and movement \r\nof weapons, a world free of wars and violent conflicts \r\nwill surely remain an illusion.\r\nWhen Pope Francis addressed the General \r\nAssembly two years ago today, he drew attention to the \r\nurgent need to\r\n“work hard for a world free of nuclear weapons by \r\nimplementing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons in letter and in spirit, until \r\nsuch instruments are totally banned” (ibid., p. 5).\r\nIn his 2017 World Day of Peace Message, Pope \r\nFrancis once again made a plea for disarmament and \r\nfor the prohibition and abolition of nuclear weapons. \r\nUnfortunately, the proliferation of nuclear weapons \r\ncontinues to increase international tensions, as can \r\nbe seen in the situation on the Korean peninsula. \r\nAs history shows, regional and bilateral treaties on \r\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons have been \r\neffective in establishing whole regions free from these \r\nweapons. It therefore seems all the more urgent that \r\nwe invest in creating those circumstances that would \r\nfacilitate the crafting of new bilateral and regional \r\ntreaties. \r\nThe Holy See has signed the Treaty on the \r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons and has already \r\ndeposited its ratification document because it believes \r\nthat it is an important contribution to the overall effort \r\ntowards total and complete nuclear non-proliferation \r\nand disarmament, that it represents progress toward the \r\nfulfilment of the commitment of the States parties to the \r\nTreaty to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective \r\nmeasures relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms \r\nrace at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and \r\na step towards negotiating a general and complete \r\ndisarmament under strict and effective international \r\ncontrol. While much remains to be done for the Treaty \r\non the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons to truly make \r\na difference and fulfil its full promise, the Holy See \r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 9/38\r\nbelieves that it is one more blow on the anvil towards \r\nthe fulfilment of the prophecy of Isaiah: \r\n“They shall beat their swords into ploughshares \r\nand their spears into pruning hooks; one nation \r\nshall not raise the sword against another, nor shall \r\nthey train for war again.”\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. António Gumende, Chair of the Delegation of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique.\r\nMr. Gumende (Mozambique): I have the honour \r\nto address the seventy-second session of the General \r\nAssembly on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Filipe Jacinto \r\nNyusi, President of the Republic of Mozambique, \r\nwho could not attend this gathering owing to other \r\ncommitments at home. Allow me therefore to start \r\nby conveying President Nyusi’s good wishes for a \r\nsuccessful session of the Assembly, which is the highest \r\nforum for global political and diplomatic dialogue.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to join the \r\nspeakers who preceded me in congratulating you, Sir, \r\non your unanimous election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session. I assure you \r\nof the full commitment of Mozambique to contributing \r\nto the realization of the goals we have all envisaged \r\nto achieve during this important session. We trust \r\nthat your gifted leadership and diplomatic experience \r\nwill add value to our endeavours and contribute to the \r\nsuccess of the work of this session. \r\nI wish equally to congratulate your predecessor, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji, for his \r\nstewardship and commitment to fulfilling the agenda \r\nat the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nA special word of appreciation goes to His \r\nExcellency Mr. António Guterres, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for the vision and leadership he has displayed \r\nin this, his first year in office. We believe that he is \r\nsteering the Organization onto the right path in order \r\nto enhance its efficiency and effectiveness as it serves \r\nus, the Member States, in our quest to deliver on the \r\nambitious goals we have set for our peoples. Only a \r\nstrong and vibrant United Nations system can ensure \r\nthat the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand its goals will deliver societies that are more \r\ninclusive, peaceful and prosperous than ever, without \r\ncompromising the very existence of our planet.\r\nTwo years after we pledged our commitment to \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, the world remains \r\nconfronted with multiple and complex challenges that \r\nthreaten to constrain the gains we made in fostering \r\nglobal peace and stability, stall and reverse the \r\nadvances made in fostering social and economic well-\r\nbeing of our peoples, and cause irreversible damage to \r\nour planet. We therefore welcome the theme chosen for \r\nthis session by the President of the General Assembly, \r\nnamely, “Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a \r\ndecent life for all on a sustainable planet”, as it allows \r\nthis body to ref lect in a timely manner on how best \r\nto address the challenges before us. This ref lection in \r\na multilateral forum such as the General Assembly is \r\nessential if we are to coordinate and consolidate our \r\napproaches as we strive individually and collectively to \r\ndeliver on the 2030 Agenda. \r\nThe renewed focus on people should serve as a \r\nuniversal impetus for all the development actors to \r\ntranslate into practice actions that promote peace and \r\nthe well-being of all humankind. It is worth recalling \r\nthat our resolve is to make the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development a framework that brings \r\ntogether the collective will to transform people’s lives \r\nin a sustainable way by lifting them from poverty and \r\npromoting human dignity without neglecting peace, \r\nwhich is a critical factor in the attainment of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, based on the interplay of the economic, \r\nsocial and environmental pillars.\r\nAs we strive to accomplish these goals, we are \r\nchallenged to find the ways and means to honour \r\nthe commitments undertaken in the Addis Ababa \r\nAction Agenda, the Sendai Framework for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction and the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange. Only joint and complementary efforts in those \r\nthree domains will enable us to build the necessary \r\nresilience at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels commensurate with the challenges before us and \r\nin line with our aspiration of leaving no country behind.\r\nThe challenges we faced and the experiences we \r\ngained in the implementation of other globally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals in the past underline the need for \r\ngreater commitment from our development partners to \r\nscale up and honour their assistance and for funding \r\npledges made to support climate resilience, mitigation \r\nand adaptation, as well as disaster-prevention efforts \r\nin developing countries. This support is of paramount \r\nimportance to mitigating the effects of climate \r\nvariability, whose devastating effects have been laid \r\nbare in the last two months in several States Members \r\nof this body. \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n10/38 17-29852\r\nFurthermore, it is also clear that a robust and \r\nefficient United Nations system, together with a strong \r\npartnership between the Organization and the regional \r\nbodies, can play a catalytic role in accelerating national \r\ndevelopment and strengthening democratic political \r\nsystems and institutions that can lead to more inclusive \r\nand peaceful societies. In that vein, we support the \r\nongoing efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General to \r\nreform and reposition the United Nations development \r\nsystem with a view to making it more responsive to the \r\ndevelopment needs of its Members.\r\nThe overwhelming challenges of our times require \r\nbold and determined political will to achieve the \r\nresults we seek. Mozambique reaffirms its unequivocal \r\ncommitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, since focusing on people has always \r\nbeen at the core of Mozambique’s national development \r\nagenda. Accordingly, we have aligned our national \r\ndevelopment agenda to include the three dimensions \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich are now reflected in the five pillars of our \r\nnational five-year plan, namely, consolidating national \r\nunity, peace and sovereignty; developing human and \r\nsocial capital; promoting employment, productivity \r\nand competitiveness; developing economic and \r\nsocial infrastructures; and ensuring sustainable and \r\ntransparent management of natural resources and the \r\nenvironment.\r\nMozambique has created a multi-stakeholder \r\nnational reference group that encompasses \r\nGovernment, civil society, the private sector and \r\ninternational cooperation partners for the management \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals and is promoting \r\ncapacity-building for its implementation, monitoring \r\nand evaluation. In the effort to consolidate national \r\nunity, peace and sovereignty, our focus on people leads \r\nus to strive to ensure that lasting peace and stability \r\nis a reality to all Mozambicans. Durable peace and \r\nstability therefore ranks as an overarching priority \r\nin our national agenda, as it is a crucial factor for the \r\ndevelopment and promotion of lasting human security \r\nin the broadest sense. Accordingly, the Government of \r\nMozambique, under the leadership of President Filipe \r\nJacinto Nyusi, is striving for an inclusive dialogue \r\nwith all political actors and civil society through \r\nboth formal and informal mechanisms, including the \r\nParliament. This inclusive approach is also used to \r\nengage Mozambicans in the conceptualization and \r\nimplementation of the national development agenda. \r\nFurthermore, our focus on people envisages not \r\nleaving anyone behind, which is one of the guiding \r\nprecepts of our universal agenda. Therefore, particular \r\nattention is given to policies and strategies aimed at the \r\nprotection and the full enjoyment of human rights, the \r\npromotion of gender equality and equity as well as the \r\nempowerment of women and youth, who constitute the \r\nmajority of our people. Mozambique believes that our \r\nfocus on people, peace, a decent life and a sustainable \r\nplanet also requires a regional dimension, particularly \r\nin the context of a globalized world. \r\nWe are therefore encouraged by the contributions \r\nthat regional and international multilateral mechanisms \r\nhave made to prevent and manage conflicts and \r\nto promote peace and stability, in particular \r\nthose under the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity, the African Union and the Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries, to which we are proud \r\nto belong. We believe that mechanisms that promote \r\npeace and prosperity should also constitute a strong \r\nplatform of action aimed at fostering dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, an unquestionable tool in the promotion \r\nof a culture of tolerance, peaceful coexistence and a \r\nsustainable world. We pledge to continue to play our \r\nrole in these endeavours.\r\nOur resolve to focus on people entails that we \r\naddress with a sense of urgency the root causes of the \r\nincrease in unregulated migration and the massive f lows \r\nof refugees, two dimensions of the human crises that we \r\nare confronted with in modern times. This regrettable \r\nreality is in great part a consequence of a succession of \r\nunresolved crises or poorly settled conflict situations \r\nin relation to which the international community bears \r\na responsibility. In that connection, we risk achieving \r\nan ineffective and fragile peace if the international \r\ncommunity remains focused on short-term and ad hoc \r\nmeasures that leave scope for the recurrence of the same \r\nintractable problems at a later stage. The international \r\ncommunity should come together to redouble efforts \r\nand to build consensus to prevent the senseless loss of \r\nlives. We need to adopt measures to reduce people’s \r\nvulnerabilities, complemented by actions that address \r\nthe complex and structural causes of these mass \r\nmovements, such as conflicts and political, social and \r\neconomic exclusion.\r\nA focus on people on a sustainable planet also \r\nrequires urgent attention to climate change. Today \r\nmore than ever before, the challenges posed by the \r\nadverse impact of climate change are noticeable. Every \r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 11/38\r\nday we are confronted by the destructive impact of \r\nclimate change, challenging those who continue to \r\nharbour doubts about the effects of human activities \r\non the environment and on the climate. The recent \r\ndevastating effects of the hurricanes, the mudslides and \r\nthe earthquake that affected millions of people in the \r\nCaribbean region, the United States of America, Sierra \r\nLeone and Mexico are vivid reminders of the scale of \r\nthe natural disaster threats we face. \r\nI would like to seize this opportunity to convey \r\nto the affected people and countries a message of \r\nsolidarity and sympathy on behalf of the people and the \r\nGovernment of Mozambique. The great human losses \r\nand the destruction of infrastructure as a result of the \r\nscale and ferocity of these storms prove once again \r\nthat, beyond our convictions, we need to ref lect and \r\nto act as a common front to face the menaces arising \r\nfrom climatic change. To that end, we reaffirm the \r\nimportance of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \r\nas an instrument to strengthen the much-needed \r\npartnerships for adaptation and mitigation measures.\r\nThe positive dynamics generated by the major \r\ndevelopment commitments made by the international \r\ncommunity in 2015 have been overshadowed by the \r\nworrying signs of the eruption of political instability, the \r\nprevailing inter- and intra-State conflicts, particularly \r\nin Africa and the Middle East, the rising tensions in \r\nthe Korean peninsula, as well as by the recurrence \r\nof acts of terrorism and of violent extremism. These \r\nchallenges to peace and stability threaten to reverse the \r\ndevelopment gains registered over the recent decades \r\nand to hinder our development efforts as we chart the \r\nway forward. \r\nTherefore, it is our hope that the ongoing \r\npeace initiatives as well as the measures to curb the \r\nrecruitment and finance of terrorist groups will \r\nresult in opportunities to further promote peace and \r\ndevelopment, as well as to strengthen human rights \r\nand to build more inclusive societies. Only through \r\nconstructive dialogue and peaceful means and solutions \r\ncan we secure durable peace and stability in our world. \r\nTo that end, we would like to emphasize the importance \r\nof strong democratic institutions at the national level, \r\nthe impact of regional cooperation and the role of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Perera (Sri Lanka), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nAs we gather in this great Hall, the world is once \r\nagain facing the threat of the dangers posed by the \r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons, which have become \r\nthe most dangerous existential threat that humankind \r\nfaces in the twenty-first century. As a country with a \r\nConstitution that values the principle of the universal \r\ndisarmament of all States and negotiated solutions to \r\ninternational conflicts, as well as the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear energy, Mozambique notes with great concern \r\nthe escalation of tension and the risk of nuclear \r\nconfrontation that is unfolding on the Korean peninsula. \r\nThe catastrophic impact of a nuclear conflict demands \r\na more restrained approach based on dialogue, skilful \r\ndiplomacy and the political will to de-escalate and \r\nto fully comply with the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions. More than anything else, the resolutions \r\nsignal our collective disapproval of the course of events \r\nin that part of the world.\r\nThe lack of progress in the decolonization of \r\nWestern Sahara, the sole African country still to exercise \r\nthe right to self-determination, continues to be a cause \r\nfor grave concern to Mozambique. Regrettably, all the \r\nefforts deployed by the United Nations, the African \r\nUnion and other actors to bring about an accepted \r\nsettlement aiming to grant the people of Western \r\nSahara their inalienable right to self-determination and \r\nindependence has not yielded results. We would like to \r\nseize this opportunity to call upon the Security Council, \r\nthe General Assembly and the international community \r\nto exercise their responsibility by implementing their \r\nown resolutions, particularly regarding the principle \r\nof self-determination and right of freedom, as well as \r\nto support the African Union and its Special Envoy \r\nto Western Sahara, Mr. Joaquim Chissano, former \r\nPresident of Mozambique.\r\nThe principle of self-determination and the right \r\nto freedom should also be a reality for the Palestinian \r\npeople. To that end, it is imperative that the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions be implemented. We \r\nbelieve that the solution relies on the two-State principle \r\nof Palestine and Israel coexisting side by side, in peace \r\nand security.\r\nMozambique has followed with great interest the \r\nefforts of Cuba and the United States of America to \r\nstabilize the diplomatic relations between these two \r\nneighbouring countries, an important step towards \r\nthe normalization of bilateral relations and bringing \r\nto an end the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n12/38 17-29852\r\nagainst Cuba. In that context, we note with concern the \r\nlatest developments and appeal to the United States of \r\nAmerica to put an end to the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo, for it hinders the socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment of Cuba and the Cuban people. Therefore, \r\nMozambique once again associates itself with the \r\noverwhelming majority of countries in this Hall to \r\ndemand the immediate termination of this unilateral \r\ncoercive measure.\r\nWe live in a world confronted by challenges that \r\ndemand global responses. The relevance of the United \r\nNations, the lodestar of multilateralism, over the \r\npast 72 years of its existence has always rested in its \r\nability to reform and reinvent itself to respond more \r\nsuitably to the challenges of the continuously changing \r\nworld that it serves. Therefore, Mozambique supports \r\nthe Secretary-General’s efforts to pursue reform of \r\nthe United Nations system in order to make it fit for \r\npurpose, and commends his demonstrated desire to \r\nfully consult and seek consent of the United Nations \r\nmembership at each stage of the process.\r\nIn addition to the ongoing reforms, we also need \r\nto urgently accelerate Security Council reform, another \r\nelement that will contribute to reaffirming the role of \r\nthe United Nations in the quest for sustainable solutions \r\nto the peace and security challenges facing humankind. \r\nThe difficulties stemming from the lack of consensus \r\namong members to initiate text-based negotiations to \r\ncomplete the reform of the Security Council constrain \r\nour ability to open a new window of opportunity that \r\nwould enhance the credibility of the organ by making \r\nit more representative of the current reality. The \r\nSecurity Council is one of the fundamental pillars of \r\nthe success of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating the \r\nunconditional commitment of the Government of \r\nMozambique to continuing to engage, in partnership \r\nwith the United Nations and fellow Member States, \r\nin the search of sustainable solutions to the problems \r\nthat affect the humanity. History has shown us that \r\nhumankind thrives best when we, the peoples, are able \r\nto share, collaborate, cooperate, engage in dialogue and \r\ncare.\r\nThe General Assembly will always be the platform \r\nwhere we renew our commitment and rededicate \r\nourselves to the noble ideals on which this great \r\nOrganization was founded — to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war and to promote \r\nsocial progress and better standards of life in larger \r\nfreedom. Let us all stay loyal to these lofty ideals \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nwork together to transform our world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ismael Abraão Gaspar Martins, Chair \r\nof the Delegation of the Republic of Angola.\r\nMr. Martins (Angola): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Angola, allow me to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on having been \r\nelected to preside over the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session and to assure him of Angola’s \r\nfull support in the fulfilment of his mission, so that \r\nhe may successfully provide us with the leadership we \r\nneed at this time.\r\nI also congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson, President of \r\nthe Assembly at its seventy-first session, on the capable \r\nmanner in which he conducted the work of the previous \r\nsession; and Mr. António Guterres on his appointment \r\nto the post of Secretary-General. Allow me to wish \r\nMr. Guterres every success in his mandate and assure \r\nhim of the full support and cooperation of Angola.\r\nAs has been reiterated several times in this forum, \r\npeace and security are fundamental premises for \r\nstability, sustainable development, democracy and the \r\npromotion of and respect for human rights. The theme \r\nchosen for this session — “Focusing on people: Striving \r\nfor peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable \r\nplanet” — is timely and compels us to collectively \r\nreflect on the actions of the United Nations to solve the \r\nmain problems affecting humankind.\r\nWe need an Organization capable of promoting \r\ninternational peace and security by acting swiftly to \r\nprevent potential conflict situations, improving the \r\nglobal strategy to combat international terrorism, and \r\nplacing economic and social development issues at the \r\ncentre of its action. In this context, we appreciate the \r\nrelevance of the four axes defined in the agenda of \r\nthis session, namely, the prevention and mediation of \r\nconflicts to achieve sustainable peace, the promotion of \r\nhuman rights, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, and the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change.\r\nWe reiterate Angola’s support for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals for reforms with a view to \r\nrevitalizing and rationalizing the resources of the \r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 13/38\r\nOrganization. The United Nations should act as the \r\nfirst instance in the promotion of peace diplomacy at \r\nthe global level.\r\nWe also reiterate the need to reform the Security \r\nCouncil in order to have it ref lect the reality of the \r\ncontemporary world. Its current composition is \r\noutdated and needs to be urgently reformed. In line \r\nwith the African position represented in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus, Angola reiterates the need to increase \r\nthe number of permanent members to ensure a fair \r\ngeographical balance. It is unfair that the African \r\ncontinent, which accounts for almost 40 per cent \r\nof the States Members of the United Nations, is not \r\nrepresented among the permanent members in the main \r\norgan in charge of maintaining peace and security in \r\nthe world.\r\nAngola underlines the importance of multilateralism \r\nin solving global problems, in accordance with the logic \r\nof shared responsibility and benefits, in recognition \r\nof the legitimate interests of all and in concertation \r\ntowards realistic solutions. Angola’s attachment to \r\nmultilateralism is strongly emphasized in its role in \r\nsolving problems that threaten peace and security on \r\nthe African continent, particularly in the Great Lakes \r\nregion. \r\nIn the context of the International Conference \r\non the Great Lakes Region, Angola has been leading \r\ndiplomatic efforts, with its regional and international \r\npartners, to find a lasting political solution capable \r\nof guaranteeing security, stability, economic and \r\nsocial development, and democracy for the countries \r\nand peoples of the region. This joint engagement has \r\nallowed for a substantial reduction of tensions in the \r\nregion, with notable advances such as the continuation \r\nof the inter-Burundi dialogue, encouraging signs in \r\nthe resolution of the political crisis in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, and positive developments in \r\nthe peace process in the Central African Republic, \r\nwhich have made it possible to hold elections in the \r\ncountry leading to the normalization of its institutions.\r\nDespite these advances, we still have a long way \r\nto go on the path towards fully stabilizing that part \r\nof our continent, and the parties involved carry the \r\nmain responsibility for ending the violence, respecting \r\nthe human rights and fundamental freedoms of the \r\ncitizens of their respective countries, and building their \r\nnational political institutions. In this context, they must \r\ndemonstrate through action their commitment to and \r\nengagement with peace agreements and other political \r\nplatforms either negotiated directly or sponsored by \r\nregional institutions and the international community.\r\nThe international community’s collective action \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations should \r\nalso cover the fight against terrorism. In this fight, \r\na significant part of our effort should be directed \r\nat combating the causes of terrorism and violent \r\nextremism, which reside, inter alia, in the social crises \r\nin and the institutional fragility of many States. The \r\ncase of Libya is a blatant example of this reality.\r\nThe African continent has been at the forefront of \r\nthe fight against terrorism, which has killed innocent \r\ncivilians, caused extensive damage to property and \r\ndestroyed the way of life of many of its countries. \r\nAngola fully supports the efforts of the African Union, \r\nwith the assistance of its international partners, to \r\nconfront the scourge of terrorism.\r\nTwo years ago, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development — an important instrument \r\nto guide the development strategies of our States. We \r\nhope that its implementation over the next 13 years \r\nwill substantially reduce the major social deficiencies \r\naffecting developing nations in particular. The economic \r\nand financial difficulties affecting most countries \r\nhave had a negative impact on the mobilization of \r\nfinancial resources for the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda, especially among the poorest, most vulnerable \r\ncountries with limited internal resources. International \r\nefforts aimed at securing critical financial resources \r\nshould be guided by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda \r\non Financing for Development, adopted in 2015.\r\nThe Republic of Angola, which is now beginning \r\na new cycle in its life as a nation, is strongly engaged \r\nin achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, \r\ndespite an adverse global economic environment. To \r\nthat end, Angola has launched its national development \r\nplan, aimed at rehabilitating and modernizing economic \r\nand social infrastructure, promoting public and private \r\ninvestment, and enhancing training, qualification and \r\nthe adequate management of human resources.\r\nThe world is moving towards consensus in \r\nrecognizing the urgency of combating climate \r\nchange. To this end, the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange is extremely important in the development of \r\nenabling tools for protecting the right to development \r\nand strengthening resilience in developing countries. \r\nAngola views the Agreement as a historic commitment \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n14/38 17-29852\r\nand an encouragement to contain global warming and \r\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The urgent need \r\nfor the world to advance the implementation of the \r\nParis Agreement has been dramatically highlighted by \r\nthe recent climate-related disasters in various parts of \r\nthe world. Angola joins in solidarity with the victims \r\nin the Caribbean, Mexico, the United States and other \r\nparts of the world.\r\nIn order to address this and other challenges facing \r\nthe international community, Angola will continue \r\nto be a safe and responsible partner of the United \r\nNations and contribute to the implementation of its \r\nagenda in an engaged manner. We are increasingly able \r\nand fit to play a decisive role in restoring peace and \r\nsecurity, particularly in Africa, as well as in furthering \r\nits economic development. To that end, Angola has \r\nremained stable, and the pacification of the country has \r\ndefinitely been achieved.\r\nThe Republic of Angola recently held its third \r\ngeneral elections in peacetime, in a climate of \r\ntranquillity, respect for differences and great civility, \r\ndemonstrating the stability prevailing in the country \r\nand that the gradual consolidation of democracy \r\nis a fact. The priorities of the new Government will \r\nfocus on economic development with particular \r\nattention on combating poverty, reducing inequalities, \r\ncombating unemployment, and improving governance \r\ninsufficiencies and development indicators as a sine qua \r\nnon for building a prosperous and democratic society.\r\nRegrettably, peace is still not prevalent in many \r\nregions. Concerning Guinea-Bissau, a country linked \r\nto Angola by historical and brotherly ties, we remain \r\nconfident and expectant regarding the resolution of the \r\npolitical impasse. In this regard, we strongly support \r\nthe efforts of all the Guinean, regional and international \r\npolitical and social actors, including the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States, the African Union, \r\nthe United Nations, the European Union and the \r\nCommunity of Portuguese-speaking Countries.\r\nThe issue of Western Sahara continues to merit \r\nthe due attention of the United Nations to ensure the \r\neffective implementation of the relevant Security \r\nCouncil and African Union resolutions. Angola \r\nencourages the main parties involved to continue the \r\ndialogue in order to resolve the dispute, which has \r\nlasted too long.\r\nIn the Middle East, we are concerned about the \r\nimpasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. \r\nAngola argues that the solution lies in the acceptance \r\nand existence of two States, living side by side in peace \r\nand security.\r\nThe tension we are now witnessing in the Korean \r\npeninsula poses a very serious threat to international \r\npeace and security. Angola joins the voices advocating \r\nfor a diplomatic solution and compliance with \r\ninternational non-proliferation instruments. The \r\npeoples of the region deserve to live in peace and not \r\nhaunted by the spectre of a conflict whose effects \r\nwould be devastating and unacceptable to the human \r\nconscience.\r\nAngola promptly welcomed the steps taken to \r\nnormalize relations between the Republic of Cuba and \r\nthe United States of America, which will benefit the \r\ntwo peoples. The complete lifting of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo would contribute \r\nsignificantly to easing tensions between the two \r\ncountries and would eliminate one of the last remnants \r\nof the Cold War. This would also bring about a more \r\nstable and peaceful environment for development in the \r\nLatin American region. This unilateral measure — the \r\nembargo — limits the Cuban people’s enjoyment of \r\ndevelopment, and its extraterritorial effects violate the \r\nprinciples and norms of international law.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights \r\nhave always been at the forefront of Angola’s foreign \r\npriorities, as evidenced by the fact that it is a party \r\nto the main international human rights instruments \r\nand maintains an exemplary cooperation and \r\nongoing dialogue with United Nations human rights \r\nmechanisms. It is in this context that Angola is a \r\ncandidate for a seat on the Human Rights Council in the \r\nelections that will take place in October 2017. We look \r\nforward to participating actively in and contributing \r\nto the protection of human rights in the regions and \r\ncountries most affected by violations of these rights. In \r\nthis regard, we would highly appreciate the support of \r\nthe members of the Assembly for our candidacy.\r\nI would like to conclude by urging Member States \r\nto renew their confidence in the United Nations and \r\nstrengthen international dialogue as a key element of a \r\nculture of peace, respect for differences among peoples, \r\nconflict prevention and the foundations of progress and \r\ndevelopment, to which all the peoples of the world have \r\nthe right and are entitled.\r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 15/38\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Craig John Hawke, Chair of the \r\nDelegation of New Zealand.\r\nMr. Hawke (New Zealand): There is no greater \r\ndemonstration of the ability of the United Nations to \r\nbring the world together than the opening of the General \r\nAssembly. The breadth of issues which are discussed in \r\nthis Hall is immense. Often there are as many points of \r\nview as there are Member States, but ultimately we as \r\nan Organization share the common goal of making the \r\nworld more peaceful and improving the lives of all of \r\nour peoples.\r\nNew Zealand is approximately 1,000 kilometres \r\nremoved from its nearest neighbour in the Pacific, but \r\nour international connections are an intrinsic part of \r\nour identity and the foundation of our prosperity. We \r\nare an outward-looking nation that relies on global \r\nstability for our trade and the safety of our people. As a \r\nfounding Member of the United Nations, New Zealand \r\nhas always supported the leading role of the  United \r\nNations in a multilateral system, which fosters positive \r\ninternational relations.\r\nGiven the significant ongoing challenges to peace \r\nand security, the role of the United Nations in preventing \r\nand resolving conflict is as relevant now as ever. \r\nAmong those challenges, North Korea presents some \r\nof the most pressing threats to international security \r\nin our time. The North Korean regime has consistently \r\ndisregarded Security Council resolutions, the wishes of \r\nthe international community and the well-being of its \r\nown people. In this past month alone, it has conducted \r\nits sixth nuclear test, launched a ballistic missile over \r\nJapan and carried out other ballistic-missile tests. \r\nThose provocative actions have directly undermined \r\nthe nuclear non-proliferation regime, and that has \r\nserious wider implications.\r\nAs we saw during our recent term on the Security \r\nCouncil, the Council works most effectively when it \r\nacts as one. New Zealand supports the strong, unified \r\nresponses by the Security Council, and we stand \r\nready to work with Member States on measures that \r\nwill fully ref lect the consequences of North Korea’s \r\nactions. We hope to see tensions defused and a path \r\nto dialogue developed. The goal of denuclearization \r\nrequires eventual engagement with Pyongyang, but \r\nany dialogue must be meaningful and constructive, \r\nand must address the issues that most concern the \r\ninternational community. Until then, we join the rest \r\nof the international community in calling on North \r\nKorea to undertake immediate actions to de-escalate \r\ntensions, improve its humanitarian situation and abide \r\nby its international obligations.\r\nThe risks associated with nuclear weapons and \r\nnuclear proliferation have been a key factor in New \r\nZealand’s long-standing commitment to international \r\nnuclear disarmament. Last week, we were pleased to \r\nsign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. \r\nThe Treaty represents an important step towards a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free world.\r\nNew Zealand is committed to playing its part to \r\naddress global threats to peace and security. We have a \r\nhistory of contributing to efforts to prevent and resolve \r\nconflict, including through the United Nations. On \r\nthe Security Council, New Zealand made determined \r\nefforts to improve the humanitarian situation in Syria. \r\nAlongside Spain, Jordan and Egypt, we managed to \r\nrenew and improve cross-border access arrangements. \r\nWe consistently raised concerns about the Council’s \r\nfailure to bring about a political solution. Unspeakable \r\ncrimes continue to be committed against the civilian \r\npopulation, and humanitarian access remains fraught. \r\nOnly a sustainable peace based on an inclusive long-\r\nterm political settlement can bring that needless \r\nconflict to an end.\r\nIn Iraq, New Zealand’s defence force personnel are \r\nworking to strengthen the capacity of Iraqi forces in \r\ntheir battle against Da’esh. We welcome the liberation \r\nof Mosul, Tal Afar and Nineveh province. That was \r\nan admirable achievement, and we acknowledge the \r\nsacrifice and commitment of the Iraqi security forces \r\nand Government. We note that the influence of Da’esh \r\nis not limited to Iraq and Syria, and that the defeat of \r\nDa’esh there will not spell the end of that group. New \r\nZealand is focused on working with others in our near \r\nregion — the Asia-Pacific — to ensure that groups \r\nlike Da’esh do not inflict suffering in the way they \r\nhave elsewhere.\r\nIn addition to security-based efforts, preventing \r\nand countering violent extremism in the first place is \r\nvital, and we are pleased to support international efforts \r\nin that regard. New Zealand has been contributing \r\nto Afghanistan’s stability since 2001. We remain a \r\ncommitted partner of Afghanistan including through \r\nthe NATO Resolute Support Mission. Ongoing support \r\nfor Afghanistan from the international community is \r\ncritical, given the scale and complexity of the challenges \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n16/38 17-29852\r\nahead, but history has demonstrated in Afghanistan \r\nthat no amount of international support can by itself \r\nbring about lasting peace and security. Afghanistan’s \r\nfuture lies in the hands of its Government and people. \r\nWe continue to call on the National Unity Government \r\nto prioritize the interests of the Afghan people above \r\nall else.\r\nThe United Nations is unique in its ability to \r\nconvene the world so as to tackle problems that \r\nrequire collective action. The speed with which parties \r\nratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change has \r\ndemonstrated the strength of commitment to take \r\nmeaningful action on climate change. New Zealand \r\nis among the many countries committed to the Paris \r\nAgreement. Progressing the Paris work programme is \r\nessential so as to deliver a framework that will ensure \r\nthat the Agreement is robust, effective and credible, \r\nand that collective ambition will increase over time.\r\nThe Pacific is at the forefront of vulnerability to \r\nthe effects of climate change. We are therefore pleased \r\nto support Fiji’s presidency of this year’s Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. It is a rare opportunity \r\nfor the region to showcase its leadership in that area. \r\nWe are an island nation within a vast Pacific Ocean. \r\nOur exclusive economic zone is 15 times larger than our \r\nland area. The sustainable management of our sea and \r\nour islands are of critical importance environmentally, \r\neconomically and culturally.\r\nSmall island developing States face unique \r\nchallenges and vulnerabilities. They are also great-\r\nocean States and stewards of considerable ocean \r\nresources. New Zealand wants to assist those States \r\nin the sustainable management of oceans to ensure \r\nthat our oceans are healthy and productive. We are \r\nmaking substantial investments to improve sustainable \r\nfisheries management in the Pacific and to reduce \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nWe are also propelling a major increase in \r\nrenewable energy generation in our region and further \r\nafield. New Zealand has taken a lead role in advocating \r\ninternationally for the reform of fossil-fuel subsidies, \r\nwhich lead to wasteful consumption, put renewable \r\nenergy at a disadvantage and depress investment \r\nin energy efficiency. We are exploiting alternative \r\nsources of development financing, including working \r\nwith the private sector, tapping into the diaspora as \r\na source of skills and investment, maximizing the \r\nvalue of remittances and increasing temporary labour \r\nmarket access.\r\nNew Zealand is supporting the achievement of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals in a wide range of \r\nareas, both domestically and internationally, including \r\nthrough our development assistance. We will continue \r\nto play our part in meeting the high level of ambition set \r\nout in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nThe Pacific is an important part of how we define \r\nourselves internationally. A strong and effective \r\nregional architecture, with the Pacific Islands Forum \r\nas the central regional body, is a key to Pacific success. \r\nNew Zealand and was pleased with the outcomes of the \r\nrecent Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting, which \r\nhad a strong focus on fisheries and climate change \r\nissues. Pacific leaders also agreed on the importance \r\nof fully implementing the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions on North Korea, including by de-registering \r\nany North Korean trading or fishing vessels currently \r\nf lagged in Pacific States’ shipping registries.\r\nNew Zealand places significant value on the \r\ninternational rules-based order. Widely recognized \r\nrules, buttressed by an effective United Nations, are the \r\nbest guarantors of our security and our economic well-\r\nbeing, particularly for small States. Such guarantees are \r\nalso the best means of ensuring decent treatment and \r\ndecent conditions for the world’s citizens, and thereby \r\nreducing conditions that can lead to unrest, conflict and \r\nmisery. But we all recognize that the United Nations \r\ncan do better, and to do so it must be more relevant, \r\neffective and fit for purpose. The Secretary-General’s \r\nreform agenda provides an opportunity for us to make \r\nthat a reality. Important work lies ahead for us to reform \r\nthe development, peace and security pillars.\r\nAnother critical element of making the United \r\nNations more effective is management reform, including \r\nstrengthening and modernizing its recruitment and \r\nmanagement processes to ensure that maximum benefit \r\nis derived from its people. New Zealand looks forward \r\nto working together with the Secretary-General and \r\nall Member States. It is our sincere hope that reform \r\ncan achieve our collective goal of better ref lecting \r\nthe ideals of the Charter of the United Nations and, \r\nultimately, ensuring that the United Nations delivers \r\nbetter outcomes for our generation and those to come.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Aksoltan Ataeva, Chair of the \r\nDelegation of Turkmenistan.\r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 17/38\r\nMrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nAllow me to convey greetings and wishes for peace \r\nand prosperity to the peoples of the member States \r\nrepresented here from the President of Turkmenistan, \r\nHis Excellency Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov.\r\nI congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his important \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session, and I wish him success in \r\nhis forthcoming work. I would also like to commend \r\nMr. Peter Thomson, President of the Assembly at \r\nits seventy-first session, for his active and effective \r\nactivities in that position.\r\nGuaranteeing international peace and security and \r\nprotecting the legal and institutional foundations that \r\nare at the basis of the modern world order are the main \r\ntask of the countries of the United Nations and of the \r\nlargest international organizations, and that requires \r\nof them closer and more coordinated cooperation. The \r\ndegree of effectiveness of such cooperation will in its \r\nturn largely determine the success of solutions to other \r\nglobal problems, including the environment, energy \r\nand food-related issues, combating terrorism, drug \r\ntrafficking and other challenges.\r\nToday the effective and uncompromising struggle \r\nagainst terrorism has become the imperative of global \r\ndevelopment. It is clear that terrorism in all its forms \r\nis a deliberate challenge to the civilized world. In \r\npoint of fact, terrorism as a phenomenon threatens to \r\nundermine the entire system of global security and its \r\npolitical and moral foundations. We strongly condemn \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations and \r\nrecognize that the prevention of terrorism is one of \r\nthe most important components of ensuring national, \r\nregional and global security.\r\nWe welcome the important role of the United \r\nNations in international efforts to combat terrorism. \r\nSupporting the efforts of the world community to \r\ncreate effective international counter-terrorism \r\nmechanisms. Turkmenistan therefore advocates the full \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy. We believe that such work should \r\nbe carried out everywhere — at the global, regional and \r\nnational levels.\r\nIn that connection, we welcome the establishment \r\nof United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, and we \r\nare ready to cooperate actively to further implement \r\nthe Ashgabat Declaration, which was adopted at the \r\noutcome of the Central Asia-United Nations High-level \r\nDialogue on Implementing the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy in Central Asia, held on \r\n13 June 2017 in Turkmenistan.\r\nNoting the role of preventive diplomacy in \r\npreventing conflicts, eliminating the causes that lead \r\nto conflict, establishing an atmosphere of trust among \r\ncountries and creating positive conditions for effective \r\ncooperation among States on political, diplomatic, \r\neconomic, social, environmental and other issues, \r\nTurkmenistan attaches particular importance to the \r\nactivities of the United Nations Regional Centre for \r\nPreventive Diplomacy for Central Asia that are aimed at \r\nachieving those objectives in the Central Asian region.\r\nThis year marks the tenth anniversary of the \r\nestablishment of the Regional Centre. Turkmenistan, \r\ntogether with Central Asian countries, intends to submit \r\nto the First Committee a draft resolution on supporting \r\npreventive diplomacy mechanisms in addressing \r\nurgent problems with the intention of supporting peace \r\nand security.\r\nThe conditions in the world and new challenges \r\nand threats to humankind dictate the need to reform \r\nthe United Nations and to review its working methods \r\nin order to strengthen its timeliness and its ability to \r\nreact to those threats. We support reforms and also the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General in that regard.\r\nThe implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) is one of the key areas of \r\nour country’s strategic cooperation with the United \r\nNations. As a result of the comprehensive work that \r\nhad been carried out jointly with the United Nations \r\nsince October 2015 at the governmental level, the 17 \r\nGoals, 148 targets and 193 indicators of the SDGs were \r\nselected and adopted. To coordinate the implementation \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals within the \r\ncountry, we have established a national mechanism for \r\nSDG implementation.\r\nTo organize training in the methodology related \r\nto issues of implementing the SDGs at the national, \r\nregional and international levels, we have opened a \r\ntraining and methodological centre within the Institute \r\nof International Relations of the Ministry of Foreign \r\nAffairs in Turkmenistan.\r\nTurkmenistan, recognizing the importance of \r\nsport as a key factor for guaranteeing peace and \r\nsustainable development, again states its commitment \r\nto strengthening international sports cooperation. \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n18/38 17-29852\r\nCurrently, in Ashgabat, the fifth Asian Indoor and \r\nMartial Arts Games are being held, with the participation \r\nof national teams from 65 countries, including 19 \r\ncountries of Oceania, which are participating for the \r\nfirst time.\r\nExpressing our firm commitment to the provisions \r\nof resolution 70/1, of 25 September 2015, entitled \r\n“Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development”, and recognizing the \r\nincreasing role that sport plays in broadening the rights \r\nand opportunities of individuals and communities, \r\nTurkmenistan has initiated the participation of the \r\nrefugee Olympic team in competitions, thereby \r\nreaffirming our country’s commitment to the ideals of \r\nhumanism, goodness, fairness and progress as anchored \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nWe express our thanks to all countries for their \r\nsupport for the initiative of Turkmenistan and Brazil in \r\nthat regard and for the adoption of the Joint Statement on \r\nEncouraging the Valuable Contribution of the Olympic \r\nTeams of Refugees to the Promotion of Peace and Human \r\nRights at the thirty-sixth session of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, on 15 September in Geneva. Pursuant to the \r\nFinal Declaration of the International Sports Congress, \r\nentitled “Asian Games 2017: International Sport \r\nCooperation for Peace and Development”, published \r\nas an official document of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session (A/71/878, annex), Turkmenistan \r\nreaffirms its proposal to host, under the auspices of \r\nUNESCO, the seventh International Conference of \r\nMinisters and Senior Officials Responsible for Physical \r\nEducation and Sport.\r\nCooperation in the area of transport is a priority \r\nfor our country in working with the United Nations and \r\nits specialized agencies. Turkmenistan will continue to \r\nactively support the implementation of the decisions of \r\nthe international community, in particular resolutions \r\n69/213, of 2014, and 70/197, of 2015, aimed at forming \r\nnew international transport and transit corridors and \r\nupdating existing ones. As an important step towards the \r\nimplementation of those documents, the Government of \r\nTurkmenistan suggested holding the first United Nations \r\nGlobal Sustainable Transport Conference, which took \r\nplace in Ashgabat in November 2016, and welcomed \r\nthe participation of the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations. Recalling that the Ashgabat Statement \r\non Commitments and Policy Recommendations was \r\nadopted at the end of the Conference, and with the \r\naim of successfully implementing the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, Turkmenistan intends to \r\nsubmit to the Second Committee at the current session \r\na draft resolution on strengthening the links between \r\nall modes of transport to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nEnsuring sustainable and fair access to energy \r\nresources is one of the main tasks on the global \r\n2030 Agenda. This year our country will chair the \r\ninternational Energy Charter Conference. In line with \r\nthe plans for our chairmanship, Turkmenistan has \r\nthis year undertaken a range of measures to revitalize \r\nthe process of developing new international legal \r\nmechanisms in the field of sustainable energy. In that \r\ncontext, we welcome the creation of an international \r\nexpert group on energy security and sustainable energy \r\nand invite States to take active part in the work of the \r\nEnergy Charter Conference, which will be held on \r\n28 and 29 November in Ashgabat.\r\nOne of our main objectives is to participate actively \r\nin international efforts to deal with the most important \r\nissues of environmental protection, including the \r\nmanagement of water resources. In the light of \r\nTurkmenistan’s chairmanship of the International Fund \r\nfor Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS), we propose holding a \r\nsummit in 2018 in Turkmenistan, with the Heads of \r\nthe Founder States of IFAS, which would include the \r\nparticipation of specialized international structures \r\nsuch as the United Nations Development Programme, \r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme and \r\nthe United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive \r\nDiplomacy for Central Asia.\r\nWe once again state our country’s readiness to \r\nseek out new approaches and ways to overcome the \r\nchallenges faced by humankind and reaffirm our firm \r\ncommitment to cooperation with the United Nations, \r\nwhich was and remains a strategic priority and a \r\npractical foundation for all of our activities in the \r\ninternational arena.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Gustavo Meza-Cuadra, Chair of the Delegation of \r\nthe Republic of Peru.\r\nMr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): It \r\nis an honour for me to address the General Assembly \r\nand congratulate the President on his election, and to \r\nexpress our willingness to contribute to the success of \r\nhis term.\r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 19/38\r\nI wish first of all to emphasize Peru’s commitment \r\nto the Charter of the United Nations, to international \r\npeace and security, to sustainable development and to \r\nhuman rights, and to the achievement of sustainable \r\npeace. For that, we need to strengthen multilateralism, \r\ndialogue and cooperation.\r\nFor Peru, the United Nations is essential for \r\nbuilding a peaceful and sustainable future, facing \r\nglobal challenges such as climate change, terrorism \r\nor corruption, and strengthening international \r\ngovernance in order to obtain a more humane, open and \r\ninclusive globalization. Peru is preparing to become a \r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council for the \r\nbiennium 2018-2019. Our vocation for peace and respect \r\nfor international law, effective collective security and \r\nadherence to the peaceful settlement of disputes will be \r\nthe guiding principles of our action.\r\nWe are a developing country that has suffered \r\nterrorism at first hand. We are a firm defender of \r\nhuman rights and a promoter of democracy and the rule \r\nof law. We will give special attention to consolidating \r\nsustainable peace and preventing conflicts and \r\nhumanitarian crises.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\nand the possible access of terrorist groups to them are \r\nreal threats. That is why we have signed the Treaty \r\non the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, and we hope \r\nthat all States possessing such weapons will adhere to \r\nthat instrument.\r\nWe condemn the nuclear tests and ballistic missile \r\nlaunches by the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, which today constitute the greatest threat \r\nto international peace and security. In the Security \r\nCouncil, we will support efforts to resume the Six-Party \r\nTalks in order to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.\r\nPeru reaffirms its commitment to the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change and its implementation. \r\nOur country is particularly vulnerable to the adverse \r\neffects of climate change, which is seen in ocean \r\nwarming, shrinking glaciers and the impact on the \r\navailability of water resources, the loss of biodiversity \r\nand other extreme phenomena. Climate change is a real \r\nthreat that knows no borders. So far this year Peru has \r\nsuffered from the rain and f looding of the coastal El \r\nNiño, and the Caribbean and the United States have \r\nsuffered a series of devastating hurricanes. That is \r\nwhy we support the initiative of President Emmanuel \r\nMacron of France to establish a Global Pact for \r\nthe Environment.\r\nPeru is also committed to achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Accordingly, we presented our \r\nfirst voluntary national review in July, reporting on our \r\nprogress in implementing the 2030 Agenda in line with \r\nour national priorities, circumstances and needs. Peru \r\npromotes, from a focus on rights, a social revolution \r\naimed at eradicating poverty through quality public \r\nservices. Ensuring access to water and sanitation is the \r\nfirst priority of our Government, which accounts for \r\nthe participation of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in \r\nthe High-level Panel on Water.\r\nIn line with the 2030 Agenda, we believe that \r\ncorruption is also a global threat, one that erodes \r\ndemocratic governance and legal stability in our \r\ncountries, diverts resources needed to finance \r\ndevelopment, generates disenchantment and mistrust in \r\ninstitutions and increases inequality. Aware of the need \r\nto confront that scourge together, Peru has proposed \r\nthat democratic governance and the fight against \r\ncorruption be the central themes of the Summit of the \r\nAmericas to be held in Lima next April, with a view to \r\nadopting concrete measures to strengthen institutions \r\nand combat impunity.\r\nThe adoption of the standards and good practices \r\nof the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment — which Peru aspires to join before \r\n2021, the year of our bicentennial as an independent \r\nnation — will also contribute to strengthening our \r\ninstitutions and achieving the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals\r\nPeruvians believe that democracy is indispensable \r\nfor stability, peace, development and the defence and \r\npromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nGuided by that conviction, my country led the process \r\nthat culminated in the adoption of the Inter-American \r\nDemocratic Charter in 2001.\r\nIn our region, democracy is an inalienable right, \r\nwhich is why Peru remains profoundly concerned with \r\nthe rupture of the democratic order and humanitarian \r\ncrisis happening in Venezuela, as well as by the \r\ninfringements on and abuses of citizens that have been \r\nreported by the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights. The solution to the grave crisis in \r\nVenezuela must be peaceful and be negotiated by the \r\nVenezuelans themselves. Any attempt, internal or \r\nexternal, to resort to force violates the principles of the \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n20/38 17-29852\r\nCharter of the Organization and undermines genuine \r\ninterest in defending democracy and respect for the \r\nrule of law, both domestically and internationally.\r\nAlong those lines, the Lima Group believes that the \r\ninitiative of the Dominican Republic to bring together \r\nthe Government and the opposition should be developed \r\nwith good faith, rules, objectives, clear deadlines and \r\nguarantees of compliance, for which international \r\naccompaniment is essential.\r\nTo conclude, I wish to convey to the General \r\nAssembly that Peru will continue to work constructively \r\nto solve the problems we face and to bring about the \r\nfuture that our peoples long for and deserve.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Jorge Arreaza, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\r\nMr. Arreaza (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): We address the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-second session in the name of the \r\nconstitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela, Nicolás Maduro Moros, and thus in the \r\nname of a sovereign, peace-loving people that believes \r\nin respect among nations and compliance with the \r\npurest and truest principles of international law — the \r\nBolivarian people of Venezuela.\r\nIn the nineteenth century, the liberating army \r\nof Simón Bolivar left its country not to conquer or \r\ndominate, but rather to help brotherly peoples achieve \r\ntheir independence, so that later they could return \r\nhome with the satisfaction of having been useful in \r\nthe cause of liberty and equality. That is the spirit \r\nthat characterizes our people and the actions of our \r\nrevolutionary Government during such difficult times \r\nfor humankind. That is why we will always uphold the \r\nBolivarian diplomacy of peace.\r\nIndeed, we are in the house of peace, the home of \r\npeaceful solutions and the land of international law \r\nand its principles. We are embraced and upheld by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, a noble multilateral \r\ninstrument to avoid war and injustices. Thus this \r\nrostrum should be respected, protected and cared for \r\nby nations. It is an all but sacred podium for the peoples \r\nthat espouse peace and understanding.\r\nHowever, this House, one of multilaterialism and \r\nrespect for the equality of peoples and States, has been \r\ndefiled, disrespected and offended, time and time again, \r\nby arrogant Powers that seek to impose their unilateral \r\nrules of the game — rules of war, suffering and pain. \r\nThat was denounced in this very place, in a resounding \r\nvoice and an incomparable manner, by Commander \r\nHugo Chávez in 2006 (see A/61/PV.12). Everyone will \r\nrecall his remark, that it smelled of sulphur in here. It \r\ncontinues to smell of sulphur. He tried to sound the \r\nalarm to generate the necessary restraint to confront the \r\nserious unilateral threats then threatening world peace.\r\nNevertheless, a week ago this Hall (see A/72/\r\nPV.3) — and the world, by way of the media — bore \r\nwitness to yet another dangerous desecration of the \r\nprinciples and objectives of the United Nations. The \r\nemperor of the world, the President of the United States, \r\nDonald Trump, used this platform built for peace \r\nto announce wars, the total destruction of Member \r\nStates and the implementation of unilateral and illegal \r\ncoercive measures. He threatened and judged at will, as \r\nif he had absolute dictatorial powers over the sovereign \r\nStates Members of our Organization. Paradoxically, in \r\na display of brazenness and political hypocracy, Donald \r\nTrump based his attacks against humankind on such \r\nvalues as peace and prosperity.\r\nIn our case, we recall that former President Barack \r\nObama, who had a different style but the same goal, \r\ndeclared the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela an \r\nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security \r\nof the United States. That was in an executive order on \r\n9 May 2015. Today, we are obliged to declare before the \r\nworld that our country was directly threatened by the \r\nPresident of the United States with the use of the most \r\npowerful military force that has ever existed in the \r\nhistory of humankind. That was on 11 August this year.\r\nAs a complement to such anachronism and an \r\noffence to our sovereignty and to the peace that has \r\nalways characterized our Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, the Trump Administration imposed illegal \r\neconomic sanctions on our economy on 25 August, \r\nwith a view to making our people suffer and forcing \r\nundemocratic changes to our system of government. In \r\nhis statement last week Donald Trump appealed to the \r\nantiquated ideological rhetoric of the Cold War, to the \r\nbest inquisitorial style of Richard Nixon and Senator \r\nJoseph McCarthy, to reiterate his threats against our \r\ncountry and our sister Republic of Cuba. Venezuela \r\nwill always seek mutually respectful dialogue with the \r\nUnited States Government. However, as the free people \r\nthat we are, we stand ready to defend our sovereignty, \r\nour independence and our democracy in any scenario \r\nand by any way.\r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 21/38\r\n Given such attitudes, the United Nations should \r\nestablish effective mechanisms to neutralize warlike \r\npretences and intentions to supplant multilaterialism, \r\nwhich has cost us so much to consolidate, with the \r\ndictatorial unilateralism of those who intend, through \r\nthe use of arms and economic blackmail, to impose \r\ndestruction and a single way of thinking on our diverse \r\nand heterogeneous humankind. In that connection, \r\nlast Tuesday the 120 members of the Movement of \r\nNon-Aligned Countries — two thirds of the General \r\nAssembly — unanimously adopted the Political \r\nDeclaration of New York as a tool for denunciation, \r\ncondemnation and joint action against coercive \r\nand unilateral measures that certain international \r\nactors impose in frank violation of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn our statement on behalf of the presidency of the \r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries at the plenary \r\nsession of the Group of 77 and China last Thursday, \r\nwe proposed that the New York Political Declaration be \r\nextended to that group of countries, which focuses on \r\neconomic affairs, because the merciless and unilateral \r\nattacks against the economies of our peoples form an \r\nessential part of those illegal, unilateral and coercive \r\nmeasures. We must urgently seek multilateral responses \r\nto avoid the imposition of coercive measures whereby \r\nGovernments that have imposed them illegally have a \r\nlegal obligation to compensate the peoples who have \r\nsuffered from their effects. In that regard, we condemn \r\nall unilateral actions against brotherly nations, such \r\nas Russia and Iran, in particular the extension of the \r\ncriminal blockade against the brotherly Republic \r\nof Cuba, which has been in effect for more than five \r\ndecades and, at this time, clearly ref lects the new winds \r\nof United States unilateralism.\r\nVenezuela firmly opposes the existence of nuclear \r\nweapons on our planet. Their possession exposes \r\nhumankind to unimaginable and unjustifiable anguish \r\nand risks. We therefore signed the Treaty on the \r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons last Wednesday. We \r\nmust make a supreme effort so that nuclear crises are \r\nde-escalated and vanish — hopefully along with their \r\nweapons — through dialogue and humanist reason.\r\nIn the area of human rights as well, Venezuela — which \r\nover the past several years has worked tirelessly \r\nto ensure the broadest form of social investment, \r\nredistributing with justice its national wealth among \r\nVenezuelan men and women so as to ensure their human \r\nand social rights — has been targeted and accused by \r\nthe United States Government. If there is any country \r\nthat is not worthy of membership in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, it is precisely the United States of America. \r\nIt is the main violator of human rights, not only on \r\nits own territory, but throughout the world, including \r\nthrough unjustified wars, the bombing of civilian \r\npopulations, clandestine imprisonment accompanied \r\nby various forms of torture, the imposition of unilateral \r\nand unlawful measures against economies in several \r\ncountries, various kinds of economic pressure, and rash \r\nmigration policies. It is the only country that has dared \r\nto use nuclear weapons against another people. It is a \r\ncountry that, violating the fundamental institutional \r\nframework of the United Nations, led the invasion of \r\nIraq in 2003 on the grounds that it was searching for \r\nweapons of mass destruction that they never found, \r\nnotwithstanding the more than 1 million deaths caused \r\nby that bloody military operation.\r\nThe United States is building a wall on its border \r\nwith Mexico, and there is proposed legislation to \r\nimpose a 7 per cent tax on immigrants’ income to fund \r\nnot their social security but the construction of that \r\nshameful wall.\r\nBased on verifiable data from United Nations \r\nagencies and rapporteurs, we can note the following. \r\nThe United States has not ratified 62 per cent of the \r\nprincipal treaties concerning human rights. In the \r\nUnited States, there is no independent institution for \r\nthe defence and promotion of human rights. The United \r\nNations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary \r\nor arbitrary executions has condemned the lack of \r\nindependence of the United States judiciary. Solitary \r\nconfinement is widespread practice in this country. The \r\nnumber of homeless people has reached 3.5 million, \r\nincluding 1.5 million boys and girls. Some 28 per \r\ncent of those living in poverty have no health-care \r\ncoverage. The maternal mortality rate has skyrocketed \r\nin recent years. Some 10,000 children are incarcerated \r\nin adult prisons, and children can be sentenced to life \r\nimprisonment. Of those who have been condemned to \r\nlife, 70 per cent are African-American. The Special \r\nRapporteur on the right to education has condemned \r\nthe use of electric shocks and physical coercion in \r\nstudy centres.\r\nThe United States is one of the seven countries in \r\nthe world that has not ratified the Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against \r\nWomen. In the United States, paid maternity leave \r\nis not mandatory. Allegations of police abuses, in \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n22/38 17-29852\r\nparticular against the African-American community, \r\nare commonplace. More than 10 million African \r\nAmericans continue to live in poverty, half of them live \r\nin situations of severe poverty. In a country in which \r\nslavery was supposed to have been abolished, the \r\nthirteenth amendment allows for slavery in the form of \r\ncriminal conviction. One in three American indigenous \r\nwomen will undergo rape in her lifetime. We are \r\ndiscussing a country in which racial discrimination is \r\nnot only unsurpassed, but one in which it is growing \r\nalongside the supremacist positions of the current \r\nAdministration. Please excuse all the details, but there \r\nare things that we must know that the media hides.\r\nVenezuela condemns terrorism in all its forms, \r\nwhether perpetrated by the violent anarchist groups \r\nthat today threaten world peace and stability or by \r\nStates that assume the right to intervene throughout the \r\nworld, gaining control of strategic natural resources \r\nthrough the use of military force with no compassion \r\nfor civilians. It pains us to see how the Mediterranean \r\nSea has become an immense cemetery, often before the \r\nblind eye and incompetence of States bearing partial \r\nresponsibility for the crises generated in the migrants’ \r\ncountries of origin, owing to a combination of both \r\nforms of terrorism.\r\nIncited and bloody wars like the prefabricated ones \r\nagainst Syria and Libya only leave behind desolation and \r\ndivision. Fortunately, with the support of their righteous \r\ninternational allies, the heroic Syrian Government and \r\npeople are coming closer to a definitive victory against \r\nterrorist groups every day. Venezuela hopes for the \r\nsuccess of the work of the Under-Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism in his \r\nrole as head coordinator of the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy. Venezuela hopes that that \r\nwork will also condemn State terrorism.\r\nVenezuela encourages the resumption of peace \r\nnegotiations between Palestine and Israel, which must \r\nlead to a lasting and durable peace between the two \r\nStates and recognizing as the borders of Palestine those \r\nthat existed in 1967, in conformity with international \r\nlaw, as well as establishing East Jerusalem as its capital. \r\nWe believe that the United Nations must assume a \r\nmuch greater proactive role in resolving that historic \r\nand unjust conflict.\r\nWe thank Secretary-General António Guterres for \r\nhis sincere efforts in facilitating the implementation \r\nof the Geneva Agreement through the good-offices \r\nmechanism so as reach a practical solution, satisfactory \r\nto the parties, in the case of the ongoing territorial \r\ndispute between ourselves and our brothers and \r\nneighbours in the cooperative Republic of Guyana.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela will always \r\nbe willing to help open the path of peace. We therefore \r\ncommend the implementation of the peace agreements \r\nbetween the Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas \r\nArmadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, to which both \r\nCommander Chávez and President Nicolás Maduro \r\nMoros devoted so much energy and effort. Likewise, \r\nwe will continue to facilitate the talks between the \r\nGovernment of Colombia and the Ejército de Liberación \r\nNacional that are under way in the Republic of Ecuador.\r\nVenezuela is not a drug-producing country, as \r\ninternational agencies have certified. We cooperate \r\nin a sovereign capacity with all neighbouring and \r\nnon-neighbouring countries in countering drug \r\ntrafficking. We express our concern about the increase \r\nin drug production in the neighbouring country of \r\nColombia. However, we have always affirmed that \r\nconsumer countries bear the primary responsibility, as \r\nthey account for the incentives underlying both drug \r\nproduction and drug trafficking, and they must assume \r\ngenuine control of the entry and distribution of drugs \r\nwithin their territories.\r\nSince we have been working for many years \r\nwith the United Nations Development Programme, \r\nVenezuela’s path towards achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals is simple, because our Plan de la \r\nPatria en Marcha and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment not only coincide, but they are also \r\ncomplementary instruments.\r\nIn terms of their financing, everyone knows that \r\nover the past 18 years, 76 per cent of Venezuela’s \r\nrevenue has been dedicated to social investment, and \r\nthat will continue to increase. No economic attack or \r\nillegal sanction will prevent President Maduro from \r\ncontinuing and developing policies that ensure the social \r\nrights of our fellow citizens. Yes, we are concerned \r\nabout the obvious lack of sources of funding for both \r\nour brotherly countries and for those that last year \r\nexpressed their willingness to comply with the 2030 \r\nAgenda although they lack the funds required to do so. \r\nThe United Nations must commit to guaranteeing that \r\nworthy funding for the comprehensive and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of all Member States.\r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 23/38\r\nIt may be no coincidence that days before and during \r\nthis seventy-second session of the General Assembly, \r\nthe effects of the frequently warned of and feared \r\nclimate change have manifested themselves through the \r\ndevastation and death caused by consecutive hurricanes \r\nof magnitudes never previously seen. Those occurred \r\nnot too far from New York. The unprecedented wrath of \r\nthose natural phenomena has affected our brothers and \r\nsisters in several Caribbean countries.\r\nThe Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda, \r\nGaston Browne, and of Dominica, Roosevelt Skerrit, \r\nmade two extraordinary statements to the General \r\nAssembly (see A/72/PV.14 and A/72/PV.19, respectively) \r\nin which they bravely and emotionally expressed \r\nthe most absolute truths and alerted us to the need \r\nfor concrete, joint and urgent action to avoid greater \r\nhavoc being wreaked by those phenomena, which \r\nare undeniably caused by climate change. Roosevelt \r\nSkerrit said that those small countries are becoming the \r\nvictims of a war that they did not choose, did not start \r\nand are not part of. It is the war of developed countries \r\nand the capitalist system against our Mother Nature. \r\nToday, with greater emphasis than ever before, we \r\nrecall the motto of environmental and conservationist \r\nsocial movements: let us not change the climate; let us \r\nchange the system.\r\nRestoring physical infrastructure and using \r\nconstruction techniques that are resistant to the \r\nhardships of new natural phenomena cannot fall to \r\nthe affected countries and people. It is also a shared \r\nand differentiated responsibility that must be borne \r\nprincipally by the countries that pollute the most and \r\nthereby contribute to climate change. In that context, \r\nand in the light of the consequences that we have \r\nwitnessed, we find it extraordinary and hostile that the \r\nGovernment of the United States, the most polluting \r\ncountry, intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change, which, while not a panacea, is \r\na collective step forward to mitigating the effects of \r\nclimate change. How many hurricanes, typhoons, \r\nlandslides, droughts and cases of subsidence; how \r\nmany deaths, injured people and devastated countries \r\nare needed to ascertain that climate change, as stated \r\nby the experts of our very own United Nations, is a \r\nthreat to the entire planet and that it is everyone’s \r\nresponsibility to reverse it?\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela offers its \r\ncondolences to the Governments and families affected \r\nby the successive hurricanes in the Caribbean and the \r\nUnited States, as well as the victims of the terrible \r\nearthquakes in our sister nation, Mexico. While we have \r\nsought to deal immediately and in solidarity with the \r\nemergencies in our region, President Nicolás Maduro \r\nwill continue to provide the necessary support, not only \r\nthat which is at our disposal, but everything we can \r\nhelp coordinate and direct in order to assist our friends \r\nand brothers in Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nAs I said at the beginning of this statement, the \r\nVenezuelan people are subject to constant aggression \r\nby hegemonic Powers who seek to seize our natural \r\nresources — no more and no less than the world’s largest \r\noil reserve and one of the most important gas reserves, \r\nas well as our gold, diamond, coltan, iron, aluminium \r\nand thorium reserves and our biological diversity, water \r\nresources and fertile lands, among others. We have \r\nsuffered multifaceted attacks against our economy, our \r\ncurrency and our production capacity. The attacks have \r\nincluded the induced generation of internal political \r\nviolence by political factions that have tried to accede \r\nto power by undemocratic means since 2002.\r\nThis year, we suffered four months of political \r\nviolence, once again aimed at overthrowing President \r\nMaduro. After the tension and pain of the unjustifiable \r\ndeaths, the opposition violence was neutralized \r\nand appeased by the great democratic and popular \r\ndemonstration on 30 July, in which more than 8 million \r\nVenezuelans came out to vote for peace and to elect \r\na civil, sovereign and plenipotentiary National \r\nConstituent Assembly.\r\nThose latest acts of violence by the Venezuelan \r\nextreme right took place on the very same 30 July in \r\nan effort to prevent people from going out to vote. Total \r\npolitical peace returned to the country from 31 July. \r\nWe are witnesses to constituent peace. Our National \r\nConstituent Assembly, in coexistence with and respect \r\nfor the rest of the constituted powers, has become not \r\nonly a peacemaker and protector of the people, but \r\nalso a quintessential instrument for national dialogue \r\non and legitimate attention to the country’s most \r\nurgent problems.\r\nWe have an active and popular democracy. We in \r\nVenezuela have organized 22 elections in 18 years. The \r\nrevolution has triumphed in 20 of those elections. We \r\nhave always developed social dialogue as a method of \r\ndeepening our democracy. That is why we also welcome \r\nthe fact that the Venezuelan political opposition \r\nhas decided to redirect itself along the democratic \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n24/38 17-29852\r\npathway and in line with the Constitution, through \r\nthe participation of all its parties in the gubernatorial \r\nelections on 15 October.\r\nWe celebrate the fact that President Danilo Medina \r\nof the Dominican Republic, former President Rodríguez \r\nZapatero of Spain, and former President Leonel \r\nFernández of the Dominican Republic have adopted and \r\ndefined the dialogue initiative that President Maduro \r\nannounced just after the establishment of the National \r\nConstituent Assembly, and have summoned the parties \r\nto a process to which Nicaragua, Bolivia, Mexico \r\nand Chile have joined. We are grateful for the sincere \r\nsupport of those friendly countries and Governments, \r\nin order to promote the only possible solution — a \r\npeaceful, constitutional and sovereign solution that is \r\nbuilt by all Venezuelans.\r\nIn these times of turmoil in the world, we want to \r\nsee a United Nations that is truly united. Any reform \r\nprocess must take place with the participation and \r\ninclusion of all its Members. We need a United Nations \r\nthat is truly effective in neutralizing violent and \r\nunilateral initiatives, as we stated moments ago, and \r\nthat is able to work together with all Member States, \r\nwithout hegemonic bias. We need a United Nations \r\nsystem that identifies and warns of the true causes of \r\nthe greatest problems humankind suffers today, and \r\nattends to them with no distractions or pressures that \r\nmay be costly, while always respecting the principles of \r\nour founding Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIt is time for definitions. The historical struggle \r\nbetween healthy multilateralism and perverse \r\nunilateralism is at its peak. Let us make decisions that \r\nalways bear in mind those who are most humble, the \r\nexcluded, those who need us most. our Mother Nature. \r\nLet us be able to look into the eyes of our children \r\nand our grandchildren with the satisfaction of having \r\nhalted the worst and guaranteed them a better future \r\nof peace, health and happiness. Let us build, through \r\nthe United Nations, that which the Liberator asked of \r\nus in 1815 — a Government system that grants us the \r\ngreatest possible amount of happiness, social security \r\nand political stability.\r\nFrom this house of multilateralism, we say, may \r\nmultilateralism live. From this place of international \r\nlaw, may international law live; from this home of peace, \r\nmay world peace live. From the heart of Venezuela, \r\nrely on the Bolivarian Government of President \r\nNicolás Maduro to close ranks on justice, humanism \r\nand peace. As the Liberator wrote on 13 April 1823 \r\nto the then President of Peru, José de la Riva Agüero, \r\n“I am inclined to think that, when it is essential, love \r\nfor the homeland will triumph”. Likewise, we hold the \r\nunwavering and unrelenting certainty that under any \r\ncircumstances, love of our sovereign, peaceful and \r\nBolivarian Venezuela, love of our working people, \r\nlove of our good people and love of the homeland, \r\nwill triumph. Peace will triumph and prevail. We will \r\nalways triumph.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Tore Hattrem, Chair of the Delegation \r\nof the Kingdom of Norway.\r\nMr. Hattrem (Norway): I would like to begin by \r\ncongratulating Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at this session.\r\nThe world has experienced unprecedented progress \r\nduring the past decades. Extreme poverty has been \r\nmore than halved, people live longer, child mortality \r\nrates are falling, and more girls attend school that \r\never before. Global and political cooperation, trade and \r\nshared rules of the road have brought us to where we \r\nare today.\r\nI would like to highlight four building blocks that \r\nare crucial for a sustainable future. The first is that \r\nour core interests are common to us all, and we can \r\nachieve more when we act together. The second is that \r\nthere can be no security without development and no \r\ndevelopment without security. The first universal road \r\nmap for development, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, is premised on that holistic perspective. \r\nThe third is that our security and welfare depend on \r\nour ability to uphold international law. Good global \r\nand national governance and the rule of law are \r\ndecisive for sustainable development. The fourth is \r\nthat protectionism and isolationism will put our shared \r\ndevelopment into reverse. We need more trade and \r\ncooperation, not less. We cannot afford to shake the \r\nvery foundations that our open, global economic order \r\nis based on. It is vital that we demonstrate our shared \r\ncommitment to a rules-based, multilateral trading \r\nsystem, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at \r\nits core. The WTO remains our best chance of creating \r\na level playing field. We will all benefit from open, \r\npredictable and enforceable rules and commitments for \r\nall. It will be crucial to achieve a substantive outcome \r\nat the WTO’s Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires \r\nin December. That will be the litmus test.\r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 25/38\r\nAs nations, our core interests are shared. We all \r\nwant peace, security and welfare for our citizens. We \r\nhave only one planet, and every nation’s and every \r\ncitizen’s security and welfare depend on our ability to \r\nprotect our natural environment and climate. We cannot \r\nallow inaction and unsustainable practices to prevail. \r\nThe good news is that the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) have given us a universal development \r\nagenda. The Sustainable Development Summit, which \r\ntook place in this Hall two years ago, represented a \r\npinnacle of global governance and a defining moment \r\nfor our common future. At that Summit, world leaders \r\ndecided to put sustainability first.\r\nPreventing and addressing war, conflict and \r\nhumanitarian crises are crucial to sustainability. \r\nNorway strongly supports Secretary-General Guterres’s \r\nvision for the United Nations. Every tool and institution \r\nwithin the United Nations system must be realigned to \r\nimprove our ability to prevent conflict and make and \r\nsustain peace. Respect for fundamental human rights \r\nis critical if we are to build resilient, prosperous and \r\npeaceful societies. Investing in human rights today will \r\nprevent conflicts tomorrow.\r\nI would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to the \r\npeace agreement between the Colombian Government \r\nand the then Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de \r\nColombia. It came about as a result of the courage and \r\nhard work of the parties, supported by international \r\npartners and a united Security Council. Norway is \r\nproud to have contributed to the process as a guarantor. \r\nThe point I want to make is that the Colombian success \r\nstory is propelling sustainable development forward \r\nboth within and outside the nation’s borders. The Final \r\nAgreement between the parties also addresses issues \r\nof general global interest, such as fighting illicit drug \r\ntrafficking and deforestation in former conflict areas. \r\nThe Colombian process has been the most inclusive \r\npeace process in history. Ensuring inclusivity in \r\nconflict resolution is both the right and the smart thing \r\nto do, and experience shows that women’s participation \r\nin peace processes tends to increase the chances of \r\nsustainable peace.\r\nStability in the Middle East and North Africa is \r\nanother issue of common interest to the international \r\ncommunity, and it will be crucial to achieve regional \r\nstability, improve States’ capacity to govern and \r\nincrease cooperation between States in the region. \r\nThe Norwegian leadership of the Ad Hoc Liaison \r\nCommittee donor group for Palestine is an example \r\nof how institutional and economic development can \r\nunderpin efforts to resolve a conflict politically.\r\nDevelopment assistance should play a more catalytic \r\nrole in our shared global campaign for sustainable \r\ndevelopment by building capacity for generating \r\ndomestic revenue, strengthening the delivery of public \r\nservices, stimulating trade and job-creating investments \r\nand enabling individuals to take responsibility for their \r\nfuture into their own hands. That is why investing in \r\neducation, particularly for girls, is the most effective \r\nway of promoting sustainable development, and why \r\nwe are working hard to promote education globally. \r\nNorway has doubled its aid to global education over the \r\npast four years.\r\nEducation creates stability and hope for children \r\nand young people in conflict areas. Preventing gaps in \r\nchildren’s education is also important for post-conflict \r\nreconstruction and development. That is why Norway \r\nhas significantly increased its contribution to education \r\nin emergencies, with 8 per cent of our humanitarian \r\nbudget now dedicated to education. Norway has helped \r\nto initiate the Education Cannot Wait fund, whose \r\npurpose is to facilitate global funding to keep children \r\nin school during conflicts and crises. Schools must also \r\nbe protected from attacks, which is why Norway has \r\nendorsed the Safe Schools Declaration and encourages \r\nothers to do the same.\r\nFurther increases in both domestic and external \r\nfinancing will be needed if we are to attain SDG 4, \r\non quality education for all. Last year, the Education \r\nCommission, initiated and supported by Norway, \r\ndelivered a report with recommendations for increasing \r\nfinancing for education, including funding for the \r\nGlobal Partnership for Education, Education Cannot \r\nWait and a new initiative, the International Finance \r\nFacility for Education. Norway has doubled its support \r\nfor global education through the Global Partnership \r\nover the past four years, and we are committed to \r\nworking with partners to ensure that the funding for it \r\nis successfully replenished.\r\nThe fight against terrorism is a core interest that \r\nwe all share. Groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq \r\nand the Levant (ISIL) cannot be allowed to challenge \r\nour free and open societies. Together we are making \r\ndecisive progress against ISIL in Syria and Iraq, and \r\nwe can now look forward to a time when ISIL will be \r\ndefeated territorially. Norway is making significant \r\ncontributions to the international coalition in every way \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n26/38 17-29852\r\nit can, and we are also providing humanitarian relief \r\nto those affected. We have disbursed $500 million for \r\nthe Syria crisis since 2016, which means that we are \r\non track to fulfil the pledge we made at the London \r\ndonor conference. We must now strengthen our efforts \r\nto secure sustainable peace in those areas, and the \r\nSecurity Council must step up and take responsibility. \r\nWe should increase our efforts to alleviate other \r\nlarge-scale humanitarian crises, such as those in \r\nYemen, South Sudan and the Lake Chad basin.\r\nWe also need a strong, unified Security Council \r\nto help us deal with the North Korean nuclear-weapon \r\nprogramme and ballistic-missile tests. A political \r\nsolution will be crucial to ensuring the security of \r\nus all.\r\nOur shared commitment to sustainable \r\ndevelopment includes the commitment to leaving no \r\none behind. Norway’s humanitarian assistance this \r\nyear, which amounts to approximately $650 million, \r\nsupports that cause. Today 142 million people are in \r\nneed of humanitarian assistance and protection, the \r\nhighest number since the end of the Second World War. \r\nMany of the current humanitarian crises are conflict-\r\nrelated, and it is more important than ever to ensure the \r\nprotection of civilians in such circumstances. We are \r\nvery concerned about the lack of respect being shown \r\nfor international humanitarian law. We underline the \r\nobligation of all the parties to a conflict to protect \r\ncivilians and ensure safe, unimpeded humanitarian \r\naccess to all people in need. Norway is working actively \r\nto strengthen respect for international humanitarian \r\nlaw among parties to armed conflicts.\r\nPutting sustainability first means acting together to \r\nsave the oceans. We applaud the Secretary-General for \r\nappointing the first-ever Special Envoy for the Ocean. \r\nWe congratulate Mr. Lajčák’s predecessor as President \r\nof the General Assembly, Mr. Peter Thomson, on his \r\nappointment to that important job and wish him every \r\nsuccess in galvanizing global efforts to protect the \r\nworld’s oceans. If we are to be able to harvest resources \r\nfrom the oceans in the future, we must ensure that they \r\nare clean and healthy. And it is important for small \r\nisland developing States — also known as large-ocean \r\nStates — to join forces to find good solutions that \r\npromote the health and sustainability of our oceans. \r\nIt was against that backdrop that Norway hosted a \r\nmeeting at the United Nations this week to explore \r\nthe enormous range of opportunities that sustainable \r\noceans can provide.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nIn conclusion, the United Nations is the backbone \r\nof our global order, and we need a strong and healthy \r\nback to address and resolve the challenges the world is \r\nfacing today. We know that we can do it together. The \r\nUnited Nations provided the leadership that united the \r\ncountries of the world through the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change, which was an important step towards \r\nensuring the sustainability of our planet. We were also \r\nable to come together in Addis Ababa in 2015 and agree \r\non a framework for financing sustainable development, \r\nwhich will be crucial to our efforts to achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. There are many \r\nshared challenges that still have to be solved, while \r\nat the same time we must safeguard all that we have \r\nalready accomplished together. Those are the tasks that \r\nwe have to tackle together in the General Assembly.\r\nNorway has actively supported the United Nations \r\nsince it was founded. Through seven decades and \r\nchanging Norwegian Governments, we have worked \r\ntirelessly in and with the United Nations for our common \r\ninterests. Norway is a candidate for membership in the \r\nSecurity Council for the period from 2021 to 2022, and \r\nwe are counting on the support of the States Members \r\nof the United Nations for our candidature.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Maria Helena Lopes de Jesus Pires, Chair of the \r\nDelegation of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste \r\nto the United Nations.\r\nMs. Pires (Timor-Leste) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I have the \r\nhonour to deliver this statement on behalf of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Francisco Guterres Lú-Olo, President \r\nof the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste.\r\n“At the outset, I would like to congratulate \r\nPresident Miroslav Lajčák on his election and wish \r\nhim every success in carrying out his duties. I \r\nwelcome the theme of the seventy-second session \r\nof the General Assembly, ‘Focusing on people: \r\nStriving for peace and a decent life for all on \r\na sustainable planet’. Conflict prevention and \r\npeacebuilding are without a doubt the tasks of \r\nour generation. I am confident that the President’s \r\ncapable leadership, together with that of Secretary-\r\nGeneral António Guterres, will encourage and \r\ninspire our strong commitment and help us succeed \r\nin our common objective.\r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 27/38\r\n“It is a happy coincidence that I have been given \r\nthe opportunity to address the General Assembly \r\ntoday, the same day on which, 18 years ago, the \r\nfirst members of the International Force in East \r\nTimor arrived in my country from Australia and \r\nNew Zealand. The arrival on 20 September 1999 \r\nof that United Nations-mandated Force paved the \r\nway for our attainment of national independence, \r\nwhich a majority of the Timorese people voted for \r\nin a referendum on self-determination held under \r\nUnited Nations supervision. On behalf of the \r\nTimorese people, I reiterate my gratitude to the \r\nUnited Nations and to all the civilians and military \r\nofficers under the f lag of the United Nations who \r\nprotect innocent people and save lives.\r\n“Another happy coincidence is that there \r\nis another key player in the process that led to \r\nthe self-determination of the Timorese people \r\namong us today — Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres. The determined efforts of Mr. Guterres, \r\nthen Prime Minister of Portugal, guided by his \r\nvalues and ethical imperatives, were decisive in \r\nensuring that today Timor-Leste is considered a \r\njoint success story for the Timorese people and the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\n“The history of Timor-Leste is a vivid reminder \r\nthat when the values of civilization, on which the \r\nvery existence of the United Nations is founded, \r\nlead us and inspire our decisions on the international \r\nscene, the United Nations and international law \r\nbecome powerful and decisive forces for settling \r\nconflicts and restoring peace. This year Timor-\r\nLeste is celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of \r\nthe restoration of its independence, on 20 May \r\n2002. Over the past 15 years, the partnerships we \r\nhave established with the United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies and development partners \r\nhave produced important and inspiring results. We \r\nhave achieved what few thought possible.\r\n“The mortality rates of children under the age \r\nof 5 have fallen by half. According to the World \r\nHealth Organization, Timor-Leste succeeded in \r\nreducing malaria rates from 220 out of 1,000 cases \r\nin 2006 to one in 1,000 in 2012. In 2002 there \r\nwere 19 doctors in Timor-Leste; today we have \r\nnearly 1,000, trained thanks to the cooperation \r\nand solidarity of the people and the Government of \r\nCuba. We have doctors in every village and several \r\nnew hospitals. My country has been declared \r\nleprosy-free by the World Health Organization for \r\nthe first time in centuries. In 2002, life expectancy \r\nat birth was 60 years; today it has reached 68.5.\r\n“We consider education, like health care, a \r\nkey priority. Our primary-education enrolment \r\nrates stand at nearly 100 per cent of school-age \r\nchildren and youth. We have recently introduced \r\na new curriculum at the primary-school level and \r\nwe given special priority in the past few years \r\nto building new schools and improving school \r\nequipment, with the primary objective of these and \r\nmany other measures being improving the quality \r\nof public schools.\r\n“The progress we have made is ref lected in the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme’s Human \r\nDevelopment Index, in which our score during \r\nthe past six years has averaged 0.610. In 2002, it \r\nwas 0.375.\r\n“The State of Timor-Leste has also undertaken \r\ninitiatives to increase women’s participation in and \r\ncontribution to the process of social and economic \r\ndevelopment, including by enacting legal measures \r\nagainst discrimination. Many East Timorese \r\nwomen occupy important positions in Government, \r\nthe justice system, other public institutions and \r\ncivil society. A third of the members of Timor-\r\nLeste’s national Parliament are women. However, \r\nensuring that women are protected against \r\nexploitation and violence, as well as giving full \r\nrecognition to their role in society, still requires the \r\nGovernment’s attention.\r\n“The Timorese people’s most important \r\nachievement during the past 15 years has been \r\nin building peace and reconciliation at both \r\nthe national and international levels. Peace and \r\nreconciliation have been made possible thanks to \r\nthe vision of our national leaders and the courage \r\nof Timorese society as a whole to reject vengeance \r\nand genuinely adhere to that vision.\r\n“We have established solid relations of \r\nfriendship and close cooperation with Indonesia \r\nand Australia. We are working to further \r\nstrengthen our relations with our neighbours in the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, to which \r\nwe have submitted our application for membership. \r\nStrengthening Timor-Leste’s regional integration \r\nis a key priority of our foreign policy.\r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n28/38 17-29852\r\n“In Timor-Leste, now that peace and stability \r\nhave been achieved, we are putting our efforts \r\ninto creating better conditions for economic \r\nand social development. In particular, we have \r\nimproved development conditions for small and \r\nmedium-sized enterprises and the private sector, \r\nand we are promoting the diversification of the \r\nnon-oil economy. This year we also strengthened \r\ndemocracy through our most recent presidential \r\nand legislative elections, which were organized \r\nentirely by the Timorese people.\r\n“We believe that a key condition for the \r\ndevelopment of the country is ensuring stable \r\nand solid institutions that provide quality public \r\nservices. This is why my country supported the \r\ninclusion in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Sustainable Development Goal 16 \r\non peace, justice and strong institutions. We believe \r\nthat there can be no development without peace, \r\nand the importance of peace for development is a \r\npriority for us that has been reflected in Timor-\r\nLeste’s commitment to establishing the g7+ \r\nsince 2009. The g7+ brings together a couple of \r\ndozen States that are emerging from conflict or \r\nin a situation of fragility. The Group’s action \r\nhas had tangible, positive results in relationships \r\nwith development partners and in bilateral and \r\nmultilateral cooperation. We have seen these mutual \r\nadvantages in the cooperation that has resulted \r\namong fragile States in relevant areas such as peace \r\nand reconciliation, the management of natural \r\nresources and the stewardship of public finances. \r\nMany of the member States of the g7+ have also \r\nhosted or are hosting United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions, putting them in the privileged position of \r\nbeing able to share their valuable experience with \r\nregard to areas of peacekeeping that have been \r\nsuccessful and those that need improvement.\r\n“Our national experience has taught us to value \r\nmultilateralism as an important instrument for \r\nresponding to challenges within the international \r\nsystem, but that is not the only reason we value \r\nit. Another is the 2030 Agenda, which embodies \r\nmultilateralism’s potential for improving the \r\nplanet and the well-being of its peoples. The 2030 \r\nAgenda has benefited from the overall experience \r\nof the process of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, and its success will benefit the many \r\nmillions who have been deprived of basic human \r\nrights through poverty. Only through dialogue, \r\nnegotiation, multilateral cooperation and respect \r\nfor democracy can we meet the ambitious goals we \r\nhave established for 2030.\r\n“Today the international community is \r\nfacing unprecedented challenge that require \r\nmultilateral cooperation and a global response. \r\nClimate change is already having a growing \r\nimpact on the development conditions for society \r\nand on the future of the planet. The effect on \r\nfood security, among other things, is central to \r\nour concerns and has been the target of several \r\nGovernment measures, including within the scope \r\nof multilateral cooperation in the Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries, which we recently \r\nhad the honour of presiding over. For small island \r\ndeveloping States, the effects of climate change \r\nrepresent an existential issue that requires attention \r\nand effort from us all.\r\n“International cooperation in the fight against \r\ntransnational crime at all levels is a top priority \r\nfor Timor-Leste. We, the international community, \r\nhave an inalienable duty to work to realize the \r\nvalues of civilization enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and its conventions. Timor-Leste is \r\na participant in a number of important multilateral \r\nprocesses for regional and international stability \r\nand security, and we will continue to expand and \r\ndeepen that participation.\r\n“The world is facing threats that were \r\nunimaginable when the United Nations was first \r\nestablished. The Organization must be capable of \r\nresponding to the new challenges facing humankind. \r\nIn that context, I would like to express Timor-\r\nLeste’s full support for the ongoing reform process \r\nled by the Secretary-General, particularly with \r\nregard to the United Nations development system \r\nand its management of areas such as peacekeeping, \r\nsecurity, gender parity and strategies against \r\nsexual exploitation and abuse, as well as his recent \r\nestablishment of a High-level Advisory Board on \r\nMediation and the Office of Counter-Terrorism\r\n“The world is currently confronting two huge \r\nthreats to international peace, the hotbeds of war \r\nin the Middle East and the nuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula and escalating tensions there. \r\nMy country urges all the parties involved, in both \r\nregions, to show the greatest possible restraint in \r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 29/38\r\norder to avoid any steps that could aggravate the \r\nsituation. Timor-Leste calls on all the parties to \r\nfully respect the relevant international conventions \r\nand Security Council resolutions. In particular, I \r\ncall for dialogue and negotiation to help defuse \r\nthe tensions and promote a peaceful settlement \r\nof the conflict on the Korean peninsula. Timor-\r\nLeste supports non-proliferation and nuclear \r\ndisarmament and is in the process of signing and \r\nratifying the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, which it expects to conclude in \r\nthe near future.\r\n“My country welcomes the prospect of the \r\nholding of an intergovernmental conference on \r\nmigration next year and considers it urgent to \r\nimprove the coordination of the international \r\ncommunity and the quality of the shelter for these \r\nmassive movements of migrants and refugees. \r\nWe must also tackle the root of the problem by \r\nincreasing development opportunities in depressed \r\nregions and reducing the drivers of migration f lows.\r\n“Ensuring that the people of Western Sahara \r\ncan finally exercise their right to self-determination \r\ncontinues to be postponed. For 26 years, the \r\nSahrawi have been peacefully waiting for the \r\nparties to comply with the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions. I call for dialogue between the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco, the legitimate representatives of the \r\nSahrawi people and the United Nations aimed at \r\narriving at a solution as soon as possible that can \r\nensure the holding of a referendum on the self-\r\ndetermination of the people of Western Sahara. \r\nI also call for the lifting of the embargo on the \r\nRepublic of Cuba, an anachronistic situation that \r\nthe international community has broadly rejected.\r\n“I am very pleased to inform the General \r\nAssembly that Timor-Leste and Australia have made \r\nimportant and decisive progress in the talks on the \r\ndemarcation of our shared maritime border. Timor-\r\nLeste initiated the settlement process required \r\nunder the United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea in April of last year. This mechanism, \r\ninitiated for the first time in history, has enabled \r\nboth countries to recently agree in principle on the \r\ncentral elements of the delimitation of the maritime \r\nborders of the Timor Sea. It has reaffirmed our \r\nfaith in the ability of the international legal system, \r\nand in particular the United Nations, to support \r\nall States. We want to point out that thanks to the \r\nUnited Nations and its procedures, it will now be \r\npossible for us to take one of our final steps towards \r\nachieving full sovereignty. We also hope that in \r\nthese times of global complexity and uncertainty, \r\nour success in that process will set a small but \r\npositive example for the international community.\r\n“In conclusion, I would like to emphasize \r\nTimor-Leste’s commitment to the multilateral \r\nsystem. Timor-Leste will continue to cooperate \r\nclosely and at every level with efforts to maintain \r\nregional and international security and stability. \r\nOur people greatly appreciate the support of the \r\ninternational community.”\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMrs. María Rubiales de Chamorro, Chair of the \r\nDelegation of the Republic of Nicaragua.\r\nMrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): Mr. President, please accept warm \r\ngreetings from our President, Commander Daniel \r\nOrtega Saavedra, our Vice-President, Rosario Murillo, \r\nand the people of Nicaragua, who wish you success in \r\nthe great responsibility that you have taken on.\r\nMany of the issues on the agenda during this session \r\nare of vital importance to the survival of our peoples. \r\nThis year we have witnessed a world in upheaval, driven \r\nby multiple crises, including violations of international \r\nlaw and the sovereignty of our peoples, wars and \r\nthreats of the use of force, and increased poverty and \r\ninequality. However, before I go into them, I would like \r\nto share my President’s ref lections summarizing the \r\npolitical will and course of action that must guide us \r\nif we are to achieve a better and more peaceful world.\r\n“We must uphold the commitment to \r\ncontinuing to fight for peace, which is the global \r\npriority of all of our peoples, and to ensuring \r\nthat the conflicts that arise in various parts of \r\nthe world can be overcome through dialogue and \r\nnegotiation. Above all, we must ensure that we are \r\nfree from the use or the threat of the use of force, \r\nwhich is what our peoples desire the most from the \r\npeoples of the great Powers towards countries with \r\nsmall populations — countries that may be small \r\nin development but that are great in their values \r\nand history.”\r\nThat should be the permanent commitment of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n30/38 17-29852\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government \r\nof Nicaragua, I would like to express our solidarity \r\nwith all the brothers and sisters of the Greater \r\nCaribbean — Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Cuba, \r\nDominica, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and \r\nall the other islands affected by the recent devastating \r\nmeteorological events that are becoming more intense \r\nand more frequent every day — and with our brothers \r\nand sisters the people and the Government of Mexico, \r\nfor the two catastrophic earthquakes that occurred \r\nthere. Our condolences and prayers go to all of the \r\nfamilies who have lost loved ones and to the people and \r\nthe Government of the United States for the hurricanes \r\nthat have caused major damage in the states of Texas \r\nand Florida.\r\nLet us focus on the importance of eradicating \r\npoverty. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nrepresents one of the most important achievements in \r\nthe history of our Organization. It is a framework for \r\nthe struggle for a just world order, so that together, in \r\npeace, solidarity and complementarity, we can make \r\nprogress on eradicating poverty. It is deplorable that so \r\nmuch poverty still persists and that inequalities are now \r\nmore marked than ever. But this development agenda \r\nwill mean nothing to our peoples if we, the peoples of \r\nthe world, do not display the political will, commitment \r\nand solidarity we need to promote human development \r\nwith social justice and environmental policies that \r\nprotect the planet in harmony with nature and ensure \r\nthe survival of the human species and the life and rights \r\nof Mother Earth.\r\nSeventy-two years on, our Organization is still \r\nunable to fully comply with the objectives set out in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We need fundamental \r\nreform urgently if we are to tackle that unfortunate \r\nsituation. To achieve that, we must promote the crucial \r\nchanges that will enable the Organization to serve the \r\ninterests of humankind. We would like to point out that, \r\nduring his presidency of the General Assembly in 2008, \r\nthe late Father Miguel D’Escoto Brockmann, whom we \r\nrightly call Nicaragua’s Chancellor of Dignity — may \r\nhe rest in peace — worked on and fought until the very \r\nend for that fundamental reform, laying the groundwork \r\nfor discussing these changes. In that regard, it will be \r\nvital to reform the Security Council in order to ensure \r\nthat its composition and function reflect the geopolitical \r\nand economic realities of the international community \r\nof the twenty-first century. Negotiations on the issue \r\nmust enter a more dynamic phase as soon as possible, \r\nand a negotiating text must be prepared with the goal \r\nof reaching the necessary agreements and proceeding \r\nwith these reforms during the Assembly’s seventy-\r\nsecond session.\r\nWe urgently need ambitious action to combat \r\nclimate change. We note with great concern the \r\nunprecedented temperatures that are being registered \r\nall over the world and the lack of interest in reducing \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions. The developed countries \r\nmust take the lead, change their unsustainable \r\npatterns of production and consumption and above \r\nall meet their financial commitments and complete \r\ntheir technology transfers. The Government and the \r\npeople of Nicaragua will continue to advocate for \r\na commitment to climate justice, as well as for an \r\nessential compensation policy that can be translated \r\ninto direct and unconditional assistance.\r\nWe have welcomed the re-establishment of \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica, but it is upsetting that we are still seeing not \r\nonly the restoration of measures aimed at maintaining \r\nthe cruel, inhuman and criminal economic, financial \r\nand commercial embargo on Cuba but also threats to \r\nits sovereignty. From this rostrum, we join the other \r\nvoices around the world saying no to the blockade of \r\nthe heroic people of Cuba, of Fidel, Raúl, and Martí.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and its \r\nBolivarian revolution continue to contend with foreign \r\nharassment, interference and aggression. We condemn \r\nthe threats of the use of force or military options \r\nmade by the President of the United States against the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, a threat that, as has \r\nbeen expressed by Nicaragua’s President,\r\n“has no place. The cry in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean is unanimous — nobody wants military \r\nintervention from the United States. No one is asking \r\nthe United States to come and intervene militarily \r\nin any Latin American or Caribbean country.”\r\nWe proclaim our unconditional solidarity with the \r\npeoples of Bolívar and Chávez, and with the Government \r\nled by its constitutional President Nicolás Maduro and \r\nhis people in their sovereign decision to democratically \r\nelect a Constituent National Assembly. Dialogue and \r\nnegotiation are the only way forward for peace and \r\nreconciliation for the great Venezuelan family.\r\nWe wish our brothers in Colombia every success \r\nin implementing their peace accord. Our President \r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 31/38\r\nhas said that Colombia is proving that there can be no \r\nmilitary solution to such conflicts, and that after more \r\nthan 50 years of war, in the end it was negotiations that \r\nprevailed. We congratulate Colombia.\r\nWe salute and will always stand in solidarity with \r\nthe struggles of the peoples under occupation of the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean country of Puerto Rico; \r\nof Western Sahara, under the leadership of the Frente \r\nPolisario; and of the Argentine Republic in its legitimate \r\nsovereign rights over its Malvinas Islands. Nicaragua \r\nreiterates its commitment to the establishment of two \r\nStates of Israel and Palestine, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital, based on the 1967 borders, with both peoples \r\nand Governments living in peace and harmony.\r\nWe reiterate our total solidarity with the \r\nGovernment and People of Syria in their fight against \r\ninternational terrorism and defence of their sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity. We emphasize the need for a \r\npolitical and negotiated solution between Syrians and \r\nan end to foreign intervention, including financing, \r\nmilitary training and supplying arms to terrorist \r\ngroups, so that there may finally be peace. We are very \r\nconcerned about the increase in terrorist attacks on our \r\nbrother peoples and condemn terrorism in all its forms \r\nand manifestations.\r\nNicaragua supports general and complete \r\ndisarmament and the total elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons. Yesterday we signed the Treaty on the \r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons. Verbal confrontations \r\nand threats of the use of nuclear weapons are \r\nunacceptable. We must work to advance commitments \r\nto eliminating nuclear arsenals around the world \r\nuntil they are gone forever, and to use the enormous \r\nresources expended on them to eradicate poverty. The \r\nsituation on the Korean peninsula is of great concern. \r\nNuclear tests contribute nothing to peace and should be \r\ncondemned. We call for a political and peaceful solution \r\nto this dangerous military scenario through dialogue \r\nand negotiation, thereby ending the nuclearization of \r\nthat region and achieving reunification and peace on \r\nthe Korean peninsula.\r\nIf we are to achieve the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, we must repeal unilateral coercive measures \r\nthat violate international law and hinder our countries’ \r\ndevelopment plans. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment was adopted on the basis of the principle \r\nof universality. It is therefore vital to ensure that no \r\none is left behind, and that includes the 23 million \r\nTaiwanese who are entitled to participate in the \r\nimplementation of this global agenda. Taiwan is willing \r\nand able to participate in and contribute to the wide \r\nrange of substantive United Nations programmes aimed \r\nat improving the well-being of humankind.\r\nWe in Central America are strengthening our \r\nintegration in every area and working with our brothers \r\nand sisters to combat the scourges of terrorism, \r\ndrug trafficking and organized crime, as well as to \r\ntransform the Gulf of Fonseca into a zone of peace \r\nand development. Our Government continues to work \r\nfor the restoration of the political, economic, social \r\nand cultural rights of all Nicaraguans, with historic \r\nand significant results in the areas of equity, gender, \r\ninvestment, development and security. Nicaragua has \r\nbeen recognized by the World Economic Forum as \r\nhaving one of the best records on gender equity in \r\nLatin America and indeed the world. Civil and human \r\nsecurity is one of our main strengths. That security \r\nis fundamental to social, political and economic \r\nstability, promoting a better quality of life, tranquillity, \r\njustice, peaceful coexistence and the comprehensive \r\ndevelopment of families.\r\nIn that regard, Nicaragua has developed a series \r\nof specific policies and programmes for combating \r\nthe scourges of our time, such as terrorism, crime, \r\ndrug trafficking, trafficking of arms and human \r\ntrafficking, with very positive results. Working with \r\ncommunities has led to a successful collaboration that \r\nmakes Nicaragua one of the safest countries in the \r\nregion and one of the least vulnerable to organized \r\ncrime. We have succeeded in that by consolidating a \r\nserious, constructive and transparent alliance between \r\nthe Government, workers and the private sector, based \r\non the model for alliance, dialogue and consensus that \r\nwe have implemented while also relying on valuable \r\ninternational assistance, for which we are grateful.\r\nMy country has been working extremely hard \r\nto make progress in the fight against poverty. We \r\ntherefore condemn the initiative of a group of United \r\nStates congressmen who are attempting to damage the \r\neconomy of Nicaraguan families through a bill known as \r\nthe Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act (NICA), \r\ncurrently in the United States Senate, aimed at blocking \r\nNicaragua’s access to international organizations’ \r\nprogramme funds for combating poverty. We want to \r\nremind the members of the United States Congress that \r\nthere is a judgment outstanding by the International \r\nCourt of Justice, in The Hague, ordering the United \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n32/38 17-29852\r\nStates to compensate the people of Nicaragua for \r\ndamages incurred from the loss of life and materials \r\ncaused by acts of terrorism committed by President \r\nReagan’s Administration despite congressional \r\nopposition, including using drug traffickers to launder \r\nmoney in order to finance a war against Nicaragua \r\nwhile circumventing congressional bans. Nicaragua \r\nhopes that Congress will comply faithfully with the \r\nverdict of the International Court of Justice, which has \r\nordered that Nicaragua be compensated and that bills \r\nsuch as the NICA Act, promoted by people bent on \r\nharming Nicaraguan families, be rejected.\r\nIn conclusion, I would once again like to quote \r\nmy President:\r\n“Here before the General Assembly, Nicaragua \r\nvows to consistently advocate for peace, stability \r\nand security in every part of our planet, in every \r\nforum, through every mechanism and with every \r\nnation with which we have relations.”\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe general debate.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish \r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply. I would like to \r\nremind members that statements in exercise of the right \r\nof reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first statement \r\nand five minutes for the second, and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Hau Do Suan (Myanmar): My delegation \r\nhas asked for the f loor to exercise its right of reply to \r\nthe irresponsible remarks made by some delegations \r\nabout my country in the past few days during the \r\ncourse of the general debate. It is deeply regrettable \r\nthat unsubstantiated allegations have been repeated \r\nin this Hall that liken the situation in Rakhine state \r\nto ethnic cleansing. Nothing is further from the truth. \r\nTerms such as “atrocities”, “ethnic cleansing”, and \r\n“genocide” should not be used lightly and only when \r\nthere is solid evidence. Atrocities, ethnic cleansing and \r\ngenocide are very serious charges that require legal \r\nreview and judicial determination. They should not be \r\nbandied about or used loosely. Myanmar objects in the \r\nstrongest terms to the use by delegations of words such \r\nas “atrocities” and “ethnic cleansing” in reference to \r\nthe situation in Myanmar. I would like to urge them \r\nand the international community as a whole to see the \r\nsituation in northern Rakhine objectively and in an \r\nunbiased manner.\r\nLet me be clear. There is no ethnic cleansing. There \r\nis no genocide. The leaders of Myanmar, who have long \r\nbeen striving for freedom and human rights, will not \r\nespouse such policies. We will do everything we can \r\nto prevent ethnic cleansing and genocide. The issue of \r\nRakhine state is extremely complex. I will not dwell on \r\nthe details, since our Vice-President already addressed \r\nthe issue at length on 20 September (see A/72/PV.10).\r\nIt is the responsibility of every Government to fight \r\nterrorism and protect innocent civilians. We condemn \r\nall human rights violations and violent acts. As members \r\nare aware, on 25 August, within hours of the release \r\nof the report of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine \r\nState, a series of coordinated attacks were carried out \r\non 30 police outposts in northern Rakhine state. The \r\nso-called Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) \r\nhas claimed responsibility for the attacks, and the \r\nGovernment of Myanmar subsequently declared ARSA \r\nto be a terrorist group. The highest Islamic organization \r\nin Myanmar, the All Myanmar Islamic Religious \r\nOrganization, has also issued a statement condemning \r\nthe terrorist attacks in Rakhine state. The vicious \r\nattacks have resulted in the loss of life and property and \r\nthe displacement of peoples. Those who have had to \r\nabandon their hearths and homes are many — not just \r\nMuslim and Rakhine, but also small minority groups \r\nsuch as Daingnet, Mro, Thet, Mramagyi and Hindus. \r\nMost of the world has been unaware of the existence \r\nand plight of those small groups.\r\nIn the affected area of northern Rakhine, the \r\nMuslim community is not a minority, as is widely \r\nreported. They are in fact a majority, because their \r\npopulation has increased, and they now constitute \r\n95 per cent of the total population in the area. The \r\nevil nature of the ARSA terrorist group was revealed \r\nonce again yesterday, when the authorities discovered \r\na mass grave of 28 Hindu villagers, including women \r\nand children, cruelly and brutally killed by the ARSA. \r\nToday another 17 bodies have been unearthed, those of \r\nsome of the 93 Hindu villagers who have been reported \r\nmissing since the attacks on 25 August. When it comes \r\nto terrorism, there can be no choices. The world cannot \r\ncondone terrorism in any form or manifestation for any \r\nreason. We must stand together to eliminate it.\r\nThe Assembly may be asking, what of the exodus? \r\nThere are several reasons for it. Prominent among \r\nthem is the fear factor. Following the terrorist attacks \r\nand the security operation, most women and children \r\nwere forced to f lee, while the men were conscripted \r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 33/38\r\ninto ARSA to fight the security forces. Many villages \r\nwere intimidated into f leeing to Bangladesh so as to \r\nattract international attention. The scorched-earth \r\npolicy of the terrorists is another factor. The seeds of \r\nterror were meticulously sown long before the attack. \r\nVillagers considered to be collaborating with the \r\nGovernment were brutally murdered. The terrorists \r\nplanted improvised explosive devices everywhere, \r\nblew up bridges and committed arson. The Government \r\nis striving to restore normalcy, and the situation has \r\nimproved. Since 5 September, there have been no \r\narmed clashes.\r\nAt present, humanitarian assistance is our top \r\npriority. We are committed to ensuring that all in need \r\nreceive aid, without discrimination. We have already \r\ndedicated significant national funds and resources \r\nto humanitarian relief operations. Relief aid and \r\nassistance has been being provided immediately after \r\nthe attacks. Now more effective measures are being \r\nput in place by the Government. A new Government-\r\nled mechanism, established in cooperation with the \r\nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, \r\nhas begun to provide humanitarian assistance to all \r\ndisplaced inhabitants. We are also discussing with \r\nour fellow member countries of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) the possibility of \r\nutilizing the ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance Centre \r\nto provide much-needed humanitarian assistance to all \r\nthe affected communities in Rakhine state.\r\nThe Government of Myanmar is fully committed to \r\nsolving the issue of Rakhine state. The recommendations \r\nof the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State have \r\ngiven us a clear road map, and the recently formed \r\nministerial-level Implementation Committee has \r\nalready begun its work. On 22 September, State \r\nCounsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi met with the \r\nCommittee and set out the immediate tasks.\r\nI would like to reiterate that refugees who have f led \r\nto Bangladesh will be repatriated to Myanmar, based \r\non the experience of 1993. We will be setting up a \r\nworking group for verification as quickly as possible in \r\norder to conduct a systematic verification process. The \r\nGovernment is organizing a visit on 28 September for \r\nthe diplomatic corps to the affected areas in northern \r\nRakhine state so that they will have the opportunity to \r\nwitness first-hand the situation on the ground. We are \r\nalso reaching out to the Bangladesh side to find a way \r\nto solve the problem of refugees.\r\nMr. Ghaniei (Islamic Republic of Iran): We have \r\nrequested the f loor in exercise of the right of reply in \r\nreaction to some statements, including the baseless \r\nclaims made by representatives of the United Arab \r\nEmirates, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain during the current \r\ngeneral debate. The representative of the United Arab \r\nEmirates, in his address on Friday, 22 September (see \r\nA/72/PV.18), made several unfounded allegations \r\nagainst my country.\r\nIt is regrettable to see that, year after year, \r\nrepresentatives of that country resort to the same \r\nfabrications against my country. If they think that by \r\nrepeating a lie often enough it becomes the truth, then \r\nthey are wholly mistaken, as in reality that proposition \r\nis itself a lie. From backing the invasion imposed by \r\nSaddam Hussein against my country, to participation \r\nin the coalition of death in Yemen and spreading takfiri \r\nextremism, the officials of the United Arab Emirates, \r\nalong with Saudi Arabia, have long opted for vicious \r\ninterventionist policies that have spread instability \r\nand chaos in the region and inflicted misery upon its \r\npeople. As their policies continue to bring about death \r\nand destruction in our region, from Syria to Yemen, it is \r\nfarcical that Saudi Arabian and United Arab Emirates \r\nrepresentatives have the audacity to accuse Iran of \r\nsupporting terrorism and interfering in other countries’ \r\ninternal affairs.\r\nThe three islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb \r\nand Lesser Tunb in the Persian Gulf have been and \r\ncontinue to be an inseparable and integral part of \r\nIranian territory, and Iran reiterates its sovereignty \r\nover those islands. Therefore, any claim to the contrary \r\nis categorically rejected. Meanwhile, the Government \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran, in line with its policy \r\nof friendship and good-neighbourliness towards all \r\nneighbouring countries, stands ready to discuss any \r\npossible misunderstandings with its neighbours. \r\nHowever, it is obvious that the territorial integrity and \r\nsovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran over said \r\nislands are not negotiable.\r\nThe representative of the United Arab Emirates \r\nshould also be reminded that the term “Persian Gulf” \r\nhas been the correct appellation for the body of water \r\nsituated between the Arabian peninsula and the Iranian \r\nplateau since 500 B.C., and will remain so forever.\r\nAllow me to also brief ly refer to the statement \r\nmade on Saturday, 23 September (see A/72/PV.20) \r\nby the representative of the regime of Bahrain, which \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n34/38 17-29852\r\ncontained many of the aforementioned baseless \r\nallegations, which we have vehemently rejected. Those \r\nillusory accusations amount to desperate efforts to \r\ncover up the violation by the oppressive regime of \r\nBahrain of the basic human rights of the majority of \r\nthe Bahraini people. By leveling those allegations, the \r\nruling family seeks to justify its tyranny, oppression and \r\nblatant trampling of the rights of the Bahraini people, \r\nwho are deprived of any meaningful participation in \r\nthe running of the country.\r\nLet me conclude by once again reiterating our call \r\nfor dialogue with a view to dispelling misunderstandings \r\nand restoring friendly relations among all countries \r\nneighbouring the Persian Gulf region.\r\nMs. Nuran (Indonesia): The delegation of Indonesia \r\nis compelled to exercise our right of reply to respond to \r\nthe statements made by the representatives of Vanuatu \r\nand Solomon Islands and echoed by the representatives \r\nof Tuvalu and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nconcerning Papua and West Papua.\r\nThis is one time too many that a hoax and false \r\nallegations are being circulated by individuals who \r\nare economically motivated by the separatist agenda \r\nof Papua and their supporters. Time and time again, \r\nthe same fabricated and false accusations are thrown \r\nat us. Those countries are sadly blindfolded. They fail \r\nto understand, or more precisely, refuse to understand.\r\nThe provinces of Papua and West Papua have \r\nundergone massive development and progress. During \r\nthe past three years, 4,325 kilometres of roads, 30 new \r\nseaports and 7 new airports were built; 2.8 million \r\nPapuans have received free basic health care; 360,000 \r\nPapuan students have received free education, while \r\nthe economy has grown at a rate of 9.21 per cent. All of \r\nthat makes Papua and West Papua provinces the fastest \r\ngrowing regions in Indonesia.\r\nThe provinces of Papua and West Papua are \r\nan integral and sovereign part of Indonesia. They \r\nwill always remain an integral part of Indonesia. \r\nThose countries have been foolishly deceived by \r\nindividuals — I repeat, individuals — with a separatist \r\nagenda to exploit the issue of human rights. If human \r\nrights are at the heart of the issue, why were those \r\nconcerns not raised in the appropriate forum, namely, \r\nthe third cycle of the Universal Periodic Review of \r\nIndonesia at the United Nations Human Rights Council? \r\nIf Indonesia had anything to hide concerning human \r\nrights issues in this day and age of open technology, \r\nby now everybody would know if such accusations \r\neven existed.\r\nIndonesia fails to understand how countries continue \r\nto support separatist activities in other countries. Is \r\nthat a way to hide from one’s own domestic problems? \r\nDo those countries have a perfect human rights track \r\nrecord? Obviously their motivation in this body is to \r\ndismember the territorial integrity of a sovereign and \r\nindependent nation. Such actions are illegal, must not \r\nbe condoned and violate the fundamental principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We \r\ncannot let that happen. We cannot let it continue. \r\nIndonesia categorically rejects all accusations made \r\nby those countries and the individuals with separatist \r\nagendas operating behind them.\r\nI would like to conclude by quoting an old \r\nIndonesian proverb: if you slap the water in a bucket, \r\nthen be careful of the water splashing over your \r\nown face.\r\nMs. Tripathi (India): I take the f loor to respond to \r\nthe statement made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nPakistan, in exercise of the right of reply, on Saturday, \r\n23 September (see A/72/PV.22).\r\nThe Permanent Representative of Pakistan in her \r\nstatement yet again sought to divert attention from \r\nPakistan’s role as the hub of global terrorism. She \r\ndid so by callously holding up a picture of an injured \r\ngirl. It was a photograph of Rawya abu Jom’a, a girl \r\nfrom Palestine. The picture was taken on 22 July 2014 \r\nby an American photographer, Heidi Levine. The \r\nphotograph was published by The New York Times on \r\n24 March 2015, under the caption, “Conflict, Courage \r\nand Healing in Gaza”. The Permanent Representative \r\nof Pakistan misled the Assembly by displaying that \r\npicture to spread falsehoods about India — a fake \r\npicture to push a completely false narrative.\r\nIn view of that cynical and misleading attempt by \r\nPakistan, we are constrained to show the Assembly \r\na photograph that ref lects the real picture of pain \r\ninflicted by the nefarious designs of Pakistan on India. \r\nThis is a real — not a fake — picture of Lieutenant \r\nUmar Fayaz, a young officer from the Indian state of \r\nJammu and Kashmir. Umar Fayaz was kidnapped at \r\na wedding celebration. He was brutally tortured and \r\nkilled by Pakistan supported terrorists in May 2017. \r\nThis is a true picture. It portrays a harsh and tragic \r\nreality — a picture of terrorism emanating from across \r\nour borders that the people of India, especially in the \r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 35/38\r\nstate of Jammu and Kashmir, have to struggle with \r\nevery day. This is the reality which the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Pakistan sought to obfuscate. The \r\ntrue face of Pakistan is not hidden from anyone.\r\nMs. Hessa AlAteibi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): I speak in exercise of my right to reply to the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Iran.\r\nFirst, the three islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb \r\nand Lesser Tunb are an integral part of the territory of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates. We categorically reject all \r\nof Iran’s allegations regarding the three islands, which \r\nare occupied by Iran. I call on the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran to act fairly and use peaceful means, especially the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, to resolve this problem.\r\nSimilarly, Iran cannot exploit the nuclear \r\nagreement to interfere in the internal affairs of other \r\nStates in the region. The Islamic Republic of Iran \r\npursues expansionist regional policies and seeks to \r\nexport its problems and terrorism to other States while \r\ninterfering in the internal affairs of Arab States. Iran \r\nis playing a negative role that has a destabilizing effect \r\non our region. Any interference in our country by Iran \r\nis completely unacceptable, and we must denounce it.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is supporting terrorism, \r\nespecially through Hizbullah in Lebanon and Syria, the \r\nHouthis in Yemen, and other groups in Saudi Arabia and \r\nKuwait. With regard to the coalition for the restoration \r\nof legitimacy in Iran, which the Iranian representative \r\nmentioned, it has played a fundamental role, through \r\nthe United Nations and elsewhere, to ensure respect \r\nfor legality and legitimacy in Iran. The coalition was \r\nset up for that purpose under the leadership of Saudi \r\nArabia, and it has sought to save Yemen and uphold \r\nits sovereignty by rejecting any interference by Iran \r\nin other States. Morever, only a political process will \r\nallow Yemen to emerge from its crisis, in accordance \r\nwith Security Council resolution 2216 (2015) and the \r\nGulf Cooperation Council resolutions.\r\nIran has helped the Houthis in Yemen through \r\nmilitary and logistical means, while weapons and \r\nmunitions have been sent illegally to that country, in \r\ncomplete violation of Security Council resolutions \r\n2216 (2015) and 2231 (2015). Iran has sent weapons \r\nand munitions to Yemen, which is evidence of its \r\nexpansionist role in the region and of the threat it poses \r\nto Yemeni civilians and the other neighbours of Yemen. \r\nSuch weapons have been sent not just to the Houthis, \r\nbut also to other groups that are loyal to the former \r\nPresident Saleh.\r\nWe therefore call on the international community to \r\ntake all steps necessary to ensure that Iran ceases all of \r\nthese illegal measures. The coalition has always sought \r\na political solution to the problem, but that solution has \r\nalways been rebuffed by the Houthis.\r\nMs. Hamad (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): In \r\nresponse to the statement made by the representative of \r\nIran, the entire world is aware of the actions taken by \r\nIran in the past and the present, including interference \r\nin the internal affairs of others, aggression and support \r\nfor terrorist groups and sectarian hatred. Iran must stop \r\nthese serious human rights violations against its own \r\npeople. The Iranian regime, through its expansionist \r\nand aggressive practices towards its neighbours, has \r\nclearly undermined peace and security in the region \r\nand the entire world.\r\nWe call on the international community to assume \r\nits responsibility to confront these hateful actions of \r\nIran through its support for terrorism, intervention, \r\ninterference in domestic affairs and aggression against \r\nthe sovereignty and the territories of other countries. \r\nThese actions have devastating effects on the people \r\nand countries in the region.\r\nMr. Usman (Pakistan): Pakistan would like to \r\nexercise its right of reply to the statement just made by \r\nthe representative of India.\r\nNo matter how many times one repeats a lie, it \r\ndoes not and cannot hide the truth. The representative \r\nof India has once again chosen to divert the attention \r\nof the international community from the real issue: \r\nhuman life; human eyes — those of children and \r\ninfants — that are blinded forever; and women who are \r\nraped and the elderly people killed every day under the \r\nreign of brutality unleashed by the Indian occupation \r\nforces in Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The \r\nreal issue is that India refuses to implement the Security \r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nDistracting the debate by displaying pictures has \r\nbackfired. India’s own people do not buy its argument. \r\nIndia, which kills and tortures innocent Kashmiris, \r\nis seeking to hide behind a photograph. This shows \r\nits desperation and a vain effort to conceal its guilt. \r\nIndian State terrorism has been amply documented by \r\nsuccessive human rights reports of various international \r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n36/38 17-29852\r\norganizations. There are thousands of pictures to prove \r\nIndian State terrorism.\r\nKashmiris will never be defeated. Kashmiris will \r\ntake bullet after bullet and pellet after pellet, but they \r\nwill never give up — just like Nelson Mandela never \r\ngave up, and just like the people of Palestine never \r\ngave up. India’s diversionary tactics will not change the \r\nsituation on the ground, which India has to answer for. \r\nIt is its war crimes that India has to answer for. It is the \r\ncall for legality, morality and conscience that India has \r\nto answer.\r\nWe ask the world body to act as the conscience of \r\nthe world to ensure that no child is ever blinded again, \r\nthat no woman is raped again, and that no elderly people \r\nare pushed to the ground and killed again. Kashmiris \r\nwant freedom from the brutal Indian occupation; they \r\nwill continue to rise again and again.\r\nLet me remind my Indian colleague that racial \r\nsuperiority and religious dominance are part of the \r\npolitical ideology of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh \r\n(RSS). The former members of RSS who are now part \r\nof the Indian ruling elite are pursuing the same policy \r\nacross India, and especially in Indian-occupied Jammu \r\nand Kashmir. They are now sitting by silently as \r\nhundreds of women are raped every day across India, \r\nminorities live on the fringes of society, Muslims and \r\nChristians are publicly lynched, and State protection \r\nis given to the perpetrators of the Samjhauta train \r\nterrorist attack.\r\nTo become a regional hegemon, Indian leaders \r\nare pursuing a policy of State-sponsored terrorism, \r\nfunding and arming terrorist organizations such \r\nas Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar \r\nto launch terrorist attacks inside Pakistan, killing \r\nhundreds of innocent women, men and children. India \r\nis churning out operatives of mayhem from its factories \r\nof terror — operatives like Commander Yadav, who \r\nare spreading terror and violence across Pakistan. We \r\ncaught Yadav red-handed, and we will catch others \r\nand bring them to justice. It is not Pakistan, but India’s \r\nanimus against Pakistan that is its biggest enemy.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 8?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President: What a week we have had — 196 \r\nstatements hav been delivered from this rostrum. This \r\nis the first time in 11 years that all Member States and \r\nobservers have addressed the General Assembly. I have \r\nfollowed them closely, and many I listened to first-hand. \r\nWhen it was not possible for me to do so, I asked my \r\nteam to send me a report directly after every statement \r\nwas delivered. Thanks to their hard work, I have been \r\nable to listen to all. I will not attempt to summarize all \r\n196 statements in this short speech. I would not be able \r\nto capture the diversity and complexity of the issues \r\nraised, and I would fail to replicate the passion and \r\nexperience that was brought from nations, cities and \r\nhomes to this rostrum.\r\nI will do three things instead. First, I will focus \r\non people. I have committed to doing that throughout \r\nthe session, so today is no different. Secondly, I will \r\nreview the priorities of the seventy-second session in \r\nthe light of the input I have received from the members \r\nof the Assembly. Thirdly, I will look to the weeks and \r\nmonths ahead.\r\nWe have addressed many challenges over the past \r\nweek. Speakers have talked about their impact on the \r\ncountries of the world, and, importantly, they also \r\ntalked about their impact on people. We have heard \r\nabout people running from gunshots or the force of \r\nexploding bombs; people living for a week on the same \r\namount some of us spend on a cup of coffee; people \r\nforced to make the decision between risking their lives \r\nto stay or risking their lives to f lee; people wondering \r\nwhen the next hurricane would hit or if their village \r\nwould be underwater in a few decades; people who \r\nare beginning to lose or have already lost hope in \r\ninternational peace processes; and people still waiting \r\nfor justice and human rights to become a part of their \r\ndaily reality.\r\nThese statements have not just focused on \r\nchallenges, however. They have also spoken of solutions \r\nand the people who are working to find them. We have \r\nheard accounts of strength, resilience, partnerships and \r\nentrepreneurial spirit. And I want to thank everyone \r\nfor placing people at the centre of the general debate. I \r\nam confident that we can do even more in the coming \r\nsession. We can bring our discussions and actions \r\ncloser to the people they most affect.\r\nNow I want to focus on the seventy-second session \r\nin greater depth. I knew my own priorities before the \r\n25/09/2017 A/72/PV.23\r\n17-29852 37/38\r\ngeneral debate began. What I did not know was how \r\nthose present would respond to them. Let me now \r\noutline some of the messages I will be taking away \r\nfrom the statements delivered.\r\nFirst, I have heard overwhelming support for the \r\nproposal to prioritize peace and prevention. Many \r\nspeakers have reiterated the call of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for a surge in diplomacy to stop today’s conflicts \r\nand have called for the United Nations to do more to \r\nprevent conflicts from breaking out. We must draw \r\nfrom national, regional and international experiences \r\nof mediation and conflict prevention. We must realign \r\nour approach to emphasize peace in what we now call \r\n“peace and security”. There has also been stress on \r\ncontinued support to United Nations peacekeeping. \r\nPeace operations are doing a vital job. They work to \r\nprotect civilians and support national actors to build \r\nand maintain peace. We have heard that some citizens \r\nhave paid the ultimate price while serving under the \r\nUnited Nations f lag. I want to thank them, on behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, for their ongoing commitment.\r\nSecondly, speakers have talked about the needs \r\nof people all over the world and expressed a vision in \r\nwhich human rights, gender equality and the rule of \r\nlaw and norms reign. Today, unfortunately, they often \r\nremain the exceptions. So, we have more work to do \r\nin realizing that vision. I have also heard calls for us \r\nto look beyond the labels of “refugee” or “migrant” to \r\nsimply see people. Many have told us about the work \r\nbeing done for those people and to support for the \r\nStates and communities hosting them. Additionally, \r\nmany have stressed the need for a comprehensive \r\nglobal framework.\r\nThirdly, speakers have reminded us of all of the \r\npromises we have made to the people and the planet. \r\nThroughout the week, we have listened to accounts \r\nof the work being done to implement the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Some have also made clear that \r\nclimate change has become a matter of life or death \r\nfor people, ecosystems, ways of life and even entire \r\ncountries. It has therefore been heartening to witness \r\na major show of support for the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change in this Hall. Finally, speakers have \r\nreaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations and \r\nto one another by saying that we are stronger together \r\nin a system based on dialogue and multilaterialism, and \r\nstressed that any alternative would risk repeating the \r\nmistakes of history.\r\nBut many have also acknowledged two things. The \r\nfirst is that the world is changing. Those changes are for \r\nboth good and bad, and are happening at a fast pace. The \r\nsecond is that the United Nations must do more to adapt \r\nto that change. Over the coming session, we will hear \r\nmore ideas and positions on how that should happen. I \r\nam committed to ensuring that our discussions are as \r\nopen, inclusive and transparent as possible.\r\nI want to pause here to speak frankly. Not all of \r\nthe messages delivered in the general debate have been \r\npositive. Many of them have contained criticisms of \r\nother countries or of the United Nations. But that is \r\npart of the package. It is the right of the members of \r\nthe Assembly to do that. And regardless of the size, \r\npopulation or economy of the countries they represent, \r\nall delegations have access to the same platform for the \r\nsame amount of time. They can speak freely, without \r\ncensorship. We must remember that differences \r\nin unilateral positions do not prevent multilateral \r\nagreement. They might give us more work to do. Our \r\nnegotiations may be more difficult, but they can also \r\nmake the outcome stronger. I therefore want to embrace \r\nboth the consensus and the contention that have been \r\npart of this year’s general debate.\r\nThe only thing left to do is to look ahead. The \r\nseventy-second session will involve milestones. Some of \r\nthem are already on the calendar, such as the high-level \r\nevent on sustaining peace, in April, and the adoption \r\nof global compacts related to migrants and refugees in \r\nSeptember. Already this week, the General Assembly \r\nwill convene the high-level meeting on the appraisal \r\nof the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons. That shows our readiness \r\nto follow up on mandates inherited from previous \r\nsessions from an early stage. I am sure that other major \r\nevents will happen throughout the year, in response to \r\nthe initiative of Member States or in reaction to events \r\nhappening around the world. Additionally, the work of \r\nthe Main Committees of the General Assembly will \r\nsoon begin. All six Committees are important tools for \r\nmultilaterialism. We should make use of them.\r\nBefore I conclude, I want to thank all those who \r\nhave contributed to the general debate of the seventy-\r\nsecond session. I thank the representatives of Member \r\nStates and observers for standing up here and outlining \r\ntheir visions. I want to acknowledge the Vice-Presidents \r\nfor their able chairing on my behalf.\r\nA/72/PV.23 25/09/2017\r\n38/38 17-29852\r\nI also want to thank everyone who has worked \r\nto ensure the smooth running of the debate and the \r\nsecurity of all participating in it, and in particular our \r\ncolleagues in the Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management. Those people have not \r\nstood on the podium, but we would not be here without \r\nall of the work they have done, out of the spotlight and \r\nbehind the scenes. I believe they deserve our applause.\r\nI am sure that many of the delegations here today \r\nare breathing a sigh of relief. High-level representatives \r\nhave returned to their capitals. Schedules no longer \r\ncontain back-to-back meetings and events. Most people \r\nprobably deserve a break, but those whom we all \r\nrepresent — the people I have talked about today — need \r\nus to do the opposite. They need us to focus on action, \r\nnow more than ever. So let us get to work.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
