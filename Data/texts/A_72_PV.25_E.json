"United Nations A/72/PV.25\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n25th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 28 September 2017, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Sauer (Finland), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 107 (continued)\r\nCrime prevention and criminal justice\r\nHigh-level meeting of the General Assembly on \r\nthe appraisal of the United Nations Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons\r\nThe Acting President: Before we proceed, I would \r\nlike to appeal to all speakers to limit their statements to \r\nthree minutes when speaking in their national capacity \r\nand five minutes when speaking on behalf of a group of \r\nStates, as stipulated in resolution 71/287. As members \r\nwill recall, in resolution 71/323, of 8 September 2017, \r\nthe General Assembly called for strict adherence by \r\neach speaker to the time limits of the Assembly, in \r\nparticular during high-level meetings. This will enable \r\nmaximum participation within the limited time available \r\nfor this meeting. Participants with longer statements \r\nare encouraged to read a shorter version of their text \r\nand submit their full statements to the Secretariat for \r\nposting on the PaperSmart portal.\r\nAlso in accordance with resolution 71/323, the “all \r\nprotocol observed” principle is recommended, whereby \r\nparticipants are encouraged, in the interest of time, \r\nto refrain from listing standard protocol expressions \r\nduring their statements. In the light of that given time \r\nframe, I would like to appeal to speakers to deliver their \r\nstatements at a normal speed, so that interpretation may \r\nbe provided properly. To assist speakers in managing \r\ntheir time, a light system has been installed at the \r\nspeaker’s rostrum. May I appeal to all speakers for \r\ntheir cooperation in observing the time limit while \r\ndelivering their statements, so that all those inscribed \r\nwill be heard in a timely manner.\r\nI now give the f loor to the Chair of the delegation \r\nof Jamaica.\r\nMr. Rattray (Jamaica): Jamaica welcomes the \r\nconvening of this high-level meeting, which is consistent \r\nwith the focus of this year’s General Assembly theme \r\non people and the quest for a decent life for all. Indeed, \r\nwe recognize the mutually reinforcing relationship \r\nbetween the efforts that we are making to implement \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and the United \r\nNations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons.\r\nSeven years ago, the international community \r\nlaunched the Global Plan of Action to tackle the \r\nscourge of human trafficking through the adoption \r\nof a coordinated and comprehensive approach. As we \r\napplaud the strides made on a global level since that \r\ntime, the silent cries of victims ensnared in the grip of \r\nhuman trafficking must be given a resounding voice in \r\nevery corner of the globe.\r\nThe Government of Jamaica accords the highest \r\nlevel of political commitment to the fight against \r\nhuman trafficking and unequivocally denounces the \r\nheinous crime of trafficking in persons. We reaffirm \r\nour determination to prevent and combat trafficking in \r\npersons, protect and assist victims, prosecute crimes of \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Our \r\noverarching domestic legislation, the Trafficking in \r\nPersons (Prevention, Suppression and Punishment) \r\nAct of 2007, as amended in 2013, will be bolstered by \r\nproposed further amendments that provide for trial by \r\njudge only when it comes to cases involving human \r\ntrafficking. This proposal has been approved by the \r\nCabinet and is currently being drafted.\r\nThe Government of Jamaica is a State party to \r\nthe relevant international instruments related to the \r\nmatter, including the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress \r\nand Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women \r\nand Children, the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime, the International \r\nLabour Organization’s Forced Labour Convention \r\nand its Convention concerning the Prohibition and \r\nImmediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst \r\nForms of Child Labour, the Convention on the Rights of \r\nthe Child and its Optional Protocols, and, more broadly, \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nJamaica has afforded the highest level of \r\ninstitutional support to tackling human trafficking. \r\nWe are doing so through the establishment of an \r\ninterministerial subcommittee of the Cabinet to \r\nmonitor and make recommendations on our efforts to \r\nfight trafficking in persons, and, in 2015, we appointed \r\na national rapporteur on trafficking in persons — the \r\nfirst to be appointed in the Caribbean.\r\nFurthermore, our national task force against \r\ntrafficking in persons has the responsibility of \r\ncoordinating our national response. The composition of \r\nthe task force demonstrates the level of importance that \r\nJamaica attaches to the issue and reflects the holistic \r\napproach that we have adopted. The task force is \r\nmultisectoral and multi-stakeholder in nature and spans \r\na gamut of ministries, agencies, and non-governmental \r\norganizations that coordinate their efforts aimed at \r\nfighting human trafficking.\r\nNotwithstanding our resource constraints, Jamaica \r\nhas made significant strides in addressing the issue. Our \r\nnational plan of action to combat trafficking in persons \r\nincorporates the guiding principles of the Global Plan \r\nof Action, and its implementation is undertaken by a \r\ndedicated secretariat established for this purpose.\r\nNational efforts must be adequately supported by \r\nthose at the international level, as no country or region \r\nhas remained untouched by this gross assault on human \r\nlife and dignity. We are therefore grateful to our bilateral \r\npartners and appreciative of the ongoing partnership \r\nthat we enjoy with the United Nations system, which \r\nassists in the strengthening of our capacity to combat \r\nthis global scourge.\r\nIn closing, Jamaica is resolute in its commitment \r\nto promoting and protecting the dignity and rights of \r\nall Jamaicans. We reaffirm our determination to do our \r\npart to rid the world of such a heinous crime by taking \r\nbold, coordinated and intensified action.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Sweden.\r\nMr. Sunesson (Sweden): Sweden aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the observer of the European \r\nUnion (see A/72/PV.24) and takes this opportunity to \r\nshed some extra light on a couple of issues that we \r\nbelieve are of utmost importance in our mutual quest \r\nto eradicate trafficking in persons, in our struggle to \r\nachieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and in our efforts to deliver on our \r\npromises to help victims of trafficking.\r\nFirst, we all agree that cooperation among countries \r\nis crucial when combating trafficking in persons. \r\nSuccessful cooperation starts with a shared view of the \r\nproblem and agreement on legal definitions. Therefore, \r\nas a start, it is critical that those States Members of \r\nthe United Nations that have not yet ratified the \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime \r\nand its Protocols Thereto do so. Another essential \r\nelement in terms of cooperation is the exchange of data \r\nand best practices and information-sharing as to where \r\nanti-trafficking projects are being carried out. Equally \r\nimportant is getting a sense of which areas of the world \r\nwe should get involved in and where we can do more. \r\nSweden recognizes the important roles played by the \r\nInter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking \r\nin Persons and the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime (UNODC) in achieving that goal.\r\nSecondly, all Member States have agreed to work \r\ntowards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) set forth in the 2030 Agenda. It is worth \r\nemphasizing the importance of addressing all of the \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 3/31\r\nAgenda’s goals and targets relevant to trafficking \r\nin persons. I would also like to stress in that regard \r\nSweden’s strong belief that selectivity of focus in \r\nefforts to achieve the SDGs is counterproductive. \r\nAll goals relevant to fighting trafficking in persons \r\nshould be made a priority across the three pillars of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThirdly, I would like to highlight the issue of \r\neliminating the demand that fosters trafficking in \r\npersons. Sweden welcomes a greater focus on reducing \r\ndemand, and we request that the UNODC produce an \r\nannual report that focuses on national efforts to reduce \r\ndemand for, as an example, cheap labour and women, \r\ngirls and boys for the purpose of sexual exploitation.\r\nIt is crucial that we all undertake measures that \r\npromote and ensure decent work and contribute to \r\nsocial and economic integration and equality of \r\ntreatment. As long as there are weak labour laws, \r\nsystems or regulations, exploitation will f lourish. The \r\nsame is true with respect to trafficking in persons for \r\nsexual exploitation, which disproportionately affects \r\nwomen and girls. In order to reduce demand, policies \r\nallowing the purchase of sexual services must be \r\nrevised. The research and reports from INTERPOL \r\nand other agencies is clear: there is a clear nexus \r\nbetween prostitution and trafficking in persons for \r\nsexual exploitation.\r\nLast but not least, we would like to raise the \r\nimportant issue of our obligation to deliver on our \r\npromises to help victims, which also requires enhanced \r\ncooperation among countries. But equally importantly, \r\nit requires properly functioning cooperation between \r\nGovernments and civil society. It is therefore essential \r\nthat an environment that enables civil-society \r\norganizations — providing civil society with the \r\nfunding it needs — be ensured both nationally and \r\ninternationally. In this context, Sweden would like \r\nto reaffirm its strong support for the United Nations \r\nvoluntary trust fund for victims of trafficking in persons \r\nby pledging a gift of $100,000 to the fund in 2017.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of Italy.\r\nMr. Cardi (Italy): Italy aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered by the observer of the European \r\nUnion (see A/72/PV.24).\r\nThe political declaration adopted yesterday \r\n(resolution 72/1) summarizes the challenges that \r\nMember States and other national and international \r\nstakeholders are facing today. I would like to recall \r\nthe high-level debate that was held on 19 June 2017 \r\nin the General Assembly to commemorate Judge \r\nGiovanni Falcone, which forged a broad consensus \r\non the central role of the United Nations Convention \r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime and its \r\nProtocols Thereto, including the Protocol to Prevent, \r\nSuppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially \r\nWomen and Children, and a renewed commitment by \r\nMember States to implementing the Convention and \r\nits Protocols.\r\nI will limit myself to underlining two aspects of the \r\nchallenges that we face.\r\nFirst, we need to focus greater attention on the \r\nvictims, and, secondly, we need to adopt more effective \r\ncountering measures at the national level.\r\nWith regard to the victims of the various forms of \r\ntrafficking in persons, we agree with the contents of \r\nthe Political Declaration adopted yesterday. We must be \r\nfully aware of the physical and psychological violence \r\nthat victims suffer. Accordingly, we must guarantee \r\nassistance to victims and prevent them from becoming \r\nrevictimized through indictments for the unlawful \r\nconduct in which they were forced to engage. We must \r\nenforce their right to have justice served and help them \r\novercome trauma and live in dignity.\r\nThrough Law No. 47, of 7 April 2017, the Italian \r\nParliament addressed a growing phenomenon in our \r\ncountry, namely, the protection of unaccompanied \r\nminors. The new law harmonizes existing legislation, \r\nactivates additional resources and identifies protocols \r\nand procedures tailored to the specific needs of minors \r\nwithout families on our territory.\r\nIt has become quite clear by now that in providing a \r\nresponse for victims of trafficking, national authorities \r\nmust work in a consistent and coordinated manner to \r\nprevent one agency from taking action that counters \r\nactions from other agencies. Equally important is \r\ncoordination at the level of United Nations bodies \r\nand international institutions. In that regard, we wish \r\nto acknowledge the efforts made and results achieved \r\nby the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against \r\nTrafficking in Persons and the United Nations Office on \r\nDrugs and Crime. All of the foregoing requires a clear \r\npolitical will and adequate resources. Italy has decided \r\nto contribute $1 million to the United Nations voluntary \r\ntrust fund for victims of trafficking in persons.\r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n4/31 17-30244\r\nAs to the second aspect, I would like to make \r\nreference to resolution 71/209, which focuses on \r\ncrime prevention and criminal justice. Adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in December 2016 and facilitated \r\nby our country, the resolution invites all States to \r\ncreate national contact points and central authorities \r\nempowered to foster and render more effective both \r\ninvestigative cooperation and mutual legal assistance \r\namong different countries. Contact points and central \r\nauthorities can also play a fundamental role at the \r\ndomestic level by facilitating information exchange and \r\ncollaboration among different national administrations \r\nthat are called upon to address phenomena related to \r\ntrafficking in persons.\r\nItaly is committed to fighting international and \r\ndomestic groups that engage in human trafficking. The \r\ngrowing number of investigations and convictions for \r\nsuch crimes shows that much can be done to this end. \r\nBut it is precisely the actions of Italian prosecutors and \r\njudges that have brought the limits of international \r\ncooperation to light as well as the need for all \r\ncountries to develop adequate legislation and effective \r\ntransborder institutions.\r\nWe are deeply convinced of the importance of \r\nthese national coordination bodies. On 18 May, we \r\norganized a Security Council Arria Formula meeting \r\non central authorities charged with promoting full \r\nimplementation of the relevant provisions contained in \r\nresolution 2322 (2016), adopted by the Security Council \r\non 12 December 2016. In that forum, we presented work \r\ndone by the National Anti-Mafia and Anti-Terrorism \r\nDirectorate, the central authority in Italy, to coordinate \r\ninvestigations of transnational crimes in the context of \r\norganized crime and terrorism.\r\nIn conclusion, every victim of trafficking \r\nrepresents a world that we must protect, and every \r\naction against trafficking in persons must be part of \r\na coherent international project. These are the two \r\nsides of a hugely complex phenomenon that we must all \r\naddress together. I am sure that the high-level debate \r\nunder way and the initiatives that it inspires will make \r\nan important contribution to this end.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Nigeria.\r\nMrs. Okeke (Nigeria): Nigeria considers the \r\nholding of this high-level meeting on the appraisal of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons to be very important in view of \r\nthe need for global solidarity and cooperation in the \r\nfight against the menace of trafficking in persons.\r\nNigeria aligns itself with the statement made \r\non behalf of the Group of Friends United against \r\nTrafficking in Persons (see A/72/PV.24).\r\nNigeria is pleased to note that the global community \r\nis now developing a mechanism that will ensure the \r\neffective and full implementation of the Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, and \r\napplauds the adoption of the political declaration on the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction (resolution 72/1).\r\nThe root causes of trafficking are complex and \r\nmultidimensional. Human trafficking has been linked \r\nto poverty and ignoble practices rooted in push-and-pull \r\nfactors. These push-and-pull factors include, but are \r\nnot limited to, inadequate employment opportunities, \r\npoor living conditions, conflict, wars, famine, loss of \r\nlivelihood, forced marriages, the dissolution of families \r\nand natural disasters. While these factors can also be \r\nlinked to other vices within a society, they also act as \r\nindicators pointing the way towards the potential for \r\ntrafficking in persons.\r\nNigeria has not been exempt from this scourge, \r\nhaving been both a destination country and a country \r\nof origin, where vulnerable persons, especially young \r\nwomen and boys, have been lured across the Sahara to \r\nother continents, Europe in particular. Our Government \r\nhas zero tolerance for trafficking in human beings, \r\nwhether young or old, men or women, which is why \r\nwe have put in place strong institutional and legislative \r\nmeasure to eradicate these inhumane practices and \r\nensure that those engaged in such illegal acts are made \r\nto face the full wrath of the law.\r\nNigeria has long criminalized trafficking in \r\npersons and has made serious strides in giving priority \r\nto fighting the menace. Among these measures is the \r\nestablishment the National Agency for the Prohibition \r\nof Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), which is a \r\npermanent mechanism created in 2003 to rescue, assist, \r\nsupport and care for victims of human trafficking and \r\nto arrest, prosecute and incarcerate perpetrators.\r\nNAPTIP has remained relevant within our national \r\npolicy focus. With the establishment of the Agency, \r\nthe issue of human trafficking has been effectively \r\nmainstreamed into broader Government policies \r\nand programmes related to economic and social \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 5/31\r\ndevelopment, human rights, the rule of law, good \r\ngovernance, education, and natural-disaster and post-\r\nconflict reconstruction. NAPTIP has also strengthened \r\npartnerships among the Government, civil society, \r\nfaith-based and religious organizations, the media and \r\nvarious rights groups. The essence of such partnerships \r\nis facilitating a working synergy among the various \r\nstakeholders so as to effectively craft policies and \r\nmeasures that permanently eradicate trafficking \r\nin persons.\r\nNigeria has continued to review its relevant laws \r\nin order to effectively combat this crime. In 2015, \r\nNigeria scaled up the effectiveness of its domestic laws \r\nby adopting the Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition, \r\nEnforcement and Administration) Act of 2015, which \r\nexpanded the scope of crimes that fall under the rubric \r\nof human trafficking to include the exportation of \r\npersons for prostitution, the procurement of persons for \r\nsexual exploitation, the recruitment of persons under \r\n18 years for prostitution and sexual exploitation, the \r\nrecruitment of persons under 18 years for pornography, \r\nbrothels or foreign travel that promotes prostitution \r\nand sexual exploitation. The Trafficking in Persons \r\n(Prohibition, Enforcement and Administration) Act of \r\n2015 has broadened the scope of national legislation \r\nagainst trafficking in such a way that Nigeria could be \r\nclassified as one of the few countries in the world that \r\nhas a legislative regime against trafficking in persons \r\nthat is both potent and operative.\r\nNigeria has also strengthened its international \r\npartnerships and collaborative efforts in the area \r\nof fighting trafficking in persons. Our efforts at \r\ncollaboration have led to the rescue of victims and the \r\nprosecution of human traffickers. For example, out of \r\nthe 345 victims rescued by NAPTIP in the first quarter \r\nof this year, 288 rescues — some 83.5 per cent — were \r\nthe result of international collaboration and partnership.\r\nNigeria calls on the global community to intensify \r\nsupport for the operation of the United Nations \r\nvoluntary trust fund for victims of human trafficking, \r\nso as to make it relevant in the fight against trafficking \r\nin persons. We call for greater funding and increased \r\ndonations so as to ensure that the objectives of the \r\nfund are fully realized and provide benefit to victims. \r\nIn the same vein, Nigeria reaffirms its commitment to \r\nthe efforts being made by the United Nations Office on \r\nDrugs and Crime and the Inter-Agency Coordination \r\nGroup against Trafficking in Persons in their sustained \r\noperations to end trafficking. We therefore oppose any \r\nattempt to undermine the work of these bodies in their \r\ncollective efforts to discharge their mandates.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of Botswana.\r\nMr. Ntwaagae (Botswana): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election \r\nas the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session. In this context, I wish to assure him of \r\nthe full support and cooperation of my delegation in \r\nthe discharge of his mandate. I also wish to take this \r\nopportunity to commend him for convening this high-\r\nlevel meeting of the General Assembly on the appraisal \r\nof the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons.\r\nSimilarly, I commend the facilitators of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of the State of Qatar and Belgium, \r\nfor skilfully steering the process that culminated in \r\nGeneral Assembly’s adoption yesterday of the political \r\ndeclaration on the implementation of the Global Plan \r\nof Action (resolution 72/1). A product of extensive \r\nconsultations with Member States, observers and \r\ncivil society, the Political Declaration reaffirms our \r\ncommitment to addressing the growing menace of \r\nhuman trafficking. Accordingly, I would like to pledge \r\nBotswana’s full support for the Political Declaration \r\nand reaffirm my country’s commitment to the United \r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime, and in particular its Protocol to Prevent, \r\nSuppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially \r\nWomen and Children.\r\nIn addition to being a State party to the Convention \r\nand its Protocol, Botswana has taken stern measures \r\nto ensure that human trafficking does not take root in \r\nour country. To address the crime of human trafficking, \r\nBotswana passed the Anti-Human-Trafficking Act \r\nof 2014 and established the Human Trafficking \r\n(Prohibition) Committee. Furthermore, and in line with \r\ninternational best practices for dealing with issues of \r\nhuman trafficking, the Committee has developed an \r\nanti-human-trafficking national action plan whose \r\ncomprehensive implementation is estimated to cost \r\n$11,118,500.\r\nThe Government of Botswana is also cognizant of \r\nthe fact that, in order for the international community \r\nto adequately stem human trafficking, it is important to \r\nensure that funding levels can adequately facilitate the \r\nimplementation of programmes and planned activities. \r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n6/31 17-30244\r\nIn this respect, we commend the United Nations Office \r\non Drugs and Crime and other agencies for their \r\ncontinued support, and I appeal to them to remain \r\nsteadfast in their collaborative approaches to effectively \r\naddressing the crime of human trafficking.\r\nAt the regional level, Botswana collaborates \r\nwith other member States of the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community in a bid to improve data \r\ncollection and analysis of trafficking in persons. We \r\nbelieve that this will allow us to generate much-needed \r\ntrend analysis and similar analytical data and reports \r\nthat could enhance the effectiveness of our anti-human-\r\ntrafficking initiatives within the region.\r\nOur current national development plan — National \r\nDevelopment Plan 11 — recognizes anti-human-\r\ntrafficking efforts as key and central to attaining the \r\ngoal of crime reduction under the chapter on governance, \r\nsafety and security. Botswana also recognizes that the \r\ncrime of human trafficking transcends all sectors of the \r\neconomy. Accordingly, we cannot overemphasize the \r\nimportance of raising awareness and maintaining high-\r\nimpact information campaigns that will ultimately \r\nwork to disrupt and dismantle criminal networks and \r\nsupply chains of human trafficking.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reaffirm Botswana’s \r\ncommitment and solidarity with the international \r\ncommunity in addressing the debilitating and \r\ndehumanizing crime of human trafficking in order to \r\ncreate a safer and more peaceful world, for the benefit \r\nof both present and future generations.\r\nBotswana also fully endorses the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and its goals that advocate for \r\npeaceful and just societies across the globe.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Zambia.\r\nMr. Kapambwe (Zambia): At the outset, I wish \r\nto express gratitude to the President of the General \r\nAssembly for convening this high-level meeting to \r\nappraise the achievements, gaps and challenges in the \r\nimplementation of the 2010 United Nations Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.\r\nDespite sustained worldwide anti-trafficking \r\nefforts, human trafficking continues to pose serious \r\nthreats to sustainable development, with millions of \r\nvictims of trafficking, many of whom are children, \r\nbeing denied their human dignity and freedom. Like \r\nother developing countries, Zambia has not been spared \r\nfrom this scourge, as victims of trafficking continue \r\nto be exploited through domestic servitude in urban \r\nareas and through other types of forced labour in the \r\nagricultural, textile and construction sectors.\r\nZambia remains concerned in particular that \r\nwomen and children from developing countries, \r\nespecially sub-Saharan Africa, continue to be the \r\nlargest category of victims of trafficking in persons. \r\nIn order to eliminate all forms of human trafficking, \r\nthe Zambian Government enacted the Anti-Human \r\nTrafficking Act (No. 11) in 2008, the goal of which is \r\nto eradicate all forms of trafficking. Subsequently, the \r\nAct has been amended to provide for the prohibition, \r\nprevention and prosecution of human trafficking, as \r\nwell as the protection of victims by ensuring physical \r\nsafety, material support, counselling, rehabilitation, \r\neducation and skills development.\r\nIn addition, the Government has adopted a new \r\nnational policy that aims to eradicate all forms of \r\nhuman trafficking in the country through combined \r\nmeasures to raise awareness of issues and address the \r\nroot causes while ensuring that victims are protected \r\nand perpetrators are brought to justice. Further, in \r\n2012, the Government adopted a national plan of action \r\nto combat human trafficking, which has outlined the \r\nminimum requirements for victim care, including the \r\nestablishment and upgrading of existing shelters to \r\nbring them in line with international standards.\r\nFor its part, Zambia recognizes the central role \r\nplayed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime in the global fight against trafficking in persons, \r\nespecially in providing assistance to countries towards \r\nimplementing the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and \r\nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \r\nChildren. We also recognize the importance of the \r\nprevention of trafficking through awareness-raising \r\ncampaigns and measures that address the underlying \r\nfactors that contribute to increasing vulnerability to \r\ntrafficking, as well as the protection of victims and \r\nsurvivors, and the prosecution of traffickers through \r\nenhanced capacity-building of law-enforcement \r\nmechanisms. In that regard, my delegation welcomes \r\nthe adoption of the political declaration (resolution \r\n72/1), which stresses, inter alia, the need to address \r\nthe underlying factors that render people vulnerable \r\nto trafficking, including poverty, discrimination and \r\ngender-based violence, unemployment, humanitarian \r\nemergencies, social exclusion and marginalization.\r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 7/31\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our \r\ncommitment to working with all stakeholders to \r\nensure the rights of every victim of trafficking to \r\nassistance, protection and effective support services. \r\nIn this regard, we welcome the strong emphasis of the \r\npolitical declaration on support for the United Nations \r\nvoluntary trust fund for victims of trafficking in \r\npersons, especially women and children, established in \r\naccordance with the 2010 Global Plan of Action.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating our \r\ncommitment to working with partners to enhance the \r\ncapacity of enforcement officers and develop standard \r\noperating procedures for law-enforcement agencies so \r\nthat they are better able to screen and identify trafficking \r\nvictims, especially among such vulnerable populations \r\nas refugees and migrants and unaccompanied minors.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\ndeputy Chair of the delegation of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran.\r\nMr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): I would \r\nlike to commend the Permanent Representatives of \r\nQatar and Belgium for facilitating the negotiations \r\non the political declaration on the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons (resolution 72/1).\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is committed to \r\npreventing and fighting any manifestation of human \r\ntrafficking and reiterates its determination to take all \r\nnecessary measures to counter this horrible crime. To \r\nthis end, the Law on Combating Human Trafficking \r\nwas adopted by my country’s Parliament in 2004 and \r\nhas been revised once to fill the gaps and strengthen \r\nthe domestic legal regime. We continue our efforts \r\naimed at effective enforcement of the legislation, \r\nincluding through training of judicial and law-\r\nenforcement personnel.\r\nIn the global fight against trafficking in persons, \r\nit is essential to address all interrelated root causes \r\nthat make people vulnerable to trafficking. Millions \r\nof people, women and girls, as well as young men and \r\nboys, have fallen prey to exploitation and trafficking \r\nas a direct result of poverty and unemployment. At the \r\nsame time, foreign interventions and armed conflict \r\nhave seriously aggravated the conditions that make \r\npeople vulnerable to trafficking. Interventionist and \r\ndestabilizing policies around the world, particularly in \r\nAfrica and the Middle East, have made some countries \r\nbreeding grounds for criminal networks that engage in \r\ntrafficking in people in the most vulnerable situations.\r\nTrafficking in persons follows the principles \r\nof supply and demand. The supply side cannot be \r\nstopped, as long as unrestrained demand for forced \r\nlabour, prostitution and trafficked organs exists. The \r\ncomplex synergy between trafficking in persons and \r\ncertain crimes perpetrated by criminal organizations, \r\nsuch as drug trafficking and migrant smuggling, calls \r\nfor scaled-up international cooperation, including \r\nthrough better information-sharing and provision \r\nof capacity-building and technical assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries. Meanwhile, the importance of \r\neducation and raising awareness on human trafficking \r\nin countries of origin, transit and destination cannot be \r\noveremphasized. End users of the services provided by \r\ntrafficked persons are as much in need of educating as \r\nthose at risk of being trafficked.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to underscore the \r\nimportance of the availability of impartial and reliable \r\ndata on trafficking in persons at different levels. \r\nMember States whose destructive foreign-policy \r\noptions have left millions of people at risk of being \r\nexploited and trafficked have no moral authority to \r\nproduce politicized reports that disregard the fact that \r\nthe responsibility for the problem rests with them, \r\nand we question their competency and integrity. \r\nMeanwhile, we acknowledge the work of the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in \r\nproducing the biennial Global Report on Trafficking in \r\nPersons as a follow-up to the United Nations Global \r\nPlan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons. We \r\nalso reaffirm UNODC’s central role in promoting the \r\npartnership pillar in support of the other pillars of \r\nthe Plan of Action, which are prevention, protection \r\nand prosecution.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the United States.\r\nMs. Johnstone (United States of America): It is a \r\nprivilege to be here today as we assess our progress \r\nin preventing and combating human trafficking. In the \r\n17 years since the opening for signature of the historic \r\nProtocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking \r\nin Persons, Especially Women and Children, and the \r\nseven years since the adoption of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, \r\nour collective understanding of the realities of human \r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n8/31 17-30244\r\ntrafficking and its impact on victims and communities \r\nhas grown significantly.\r\nHowever, our enforcement of anti-trafficking laws, \r\nand the number of victims identified and assisted, \r\nremains appallingly low, especially compared to the \r\nglobal estimates of the tens of millions of victims of \r\nhuman trafficking. As traffickers’ methods continually \r\nevolve and become more sophisticated, fuelled by \r\nimpunity and billions in illicit profits, we must \r\nexpand our collective response to their crimes. The \r\nUnited States shares that challenge with all Member \r\nStates, and we fully acknowledge that it takes a \r\nholistic Government response, which must include the \r\ninvestment of significant resources and collaboration \r\nwith non-governmental organizations, the private \r\nsector, the public and, importantly, with survivors of \r\nthe crime.\r\nThe United States takes a victim-centred and \r\ntrauma-informed approach to assisting survivors of \r\ntrafficking. Federally funded programmes are available \r\nto survivors regardless of their immigration status. We \r\nhave increased our overall funding for services and \r\nconsequently the number of survivors who are assisted. \r\nDuring fiscal year 2016, the Department of Justice \r\nsupported providers offering comprehensive and \r\nspecialized victim services across the United States \r\nwith funds totalling $19.7 million. The Department of \r\nHealth and Human Services also provided $12.3 million \r\nfor a range of services to foreign and domestic victims, \r\nboth adults and children.\r\nOn the enforcement side, also during fiscal year \r\n2016, federal prosecutors secured 439 convictions \r\nof human traffickers for sex- and labour-trafficking \r\noffences, an almost 50 per cent increase from the previous \r\nyear. Multiple agencies across the federal Government, \r\nincorporating survivor input, are providing training \r\nto relevant stakeholders at the federal, state, local and \r\ntribal levels to encourage more consistent application \r\nof a victim-centred and trauma-informed approach in \r\nall phases of victim identification, assistance, recovery \r\nand participation in the criminal justice process.\r\nI am thrilled to report that, in December 2015, our \r\nPresident appointed the first United States Advisory \r\nCouncil on Human Trafficking to advise and make \r\nrecommendations on federal anti-trafficking policies. \r\nThe Council is composed of 11 human trafficking \r\nsurvivors, and it released its first report last October. \r\nThe report includes many recommendations, such \r\nas for United States-funded service providers to \r\ninclude standardized questions for screening potential \r\nsurvivors, establishing a federal housing preference for \r\nsurvivors and incorporating survivor input into public-\r\nawareness efforts.\r\nThis month the United States Department of State \r\nannounced a groundbreaking $25 million award to \r\nthe Global Fund to End Modern Slavery, an initiative \r\nthat seeks to build country and industry partnerships \r\naimed at reducing the prevalence of modern slavery in \r\nspecific countries and regions around the world, as well \r\nas a public knowledge hub where information and good \r\npractices can be shared. It aims to raise commitments \r\nof $1.5 billion from other donors. I would like to \r\nthank the United Kingdom for Prime Minister May’s \r\nannouncement last week of her country’s $20 million \r\nmatching investment in the Fund.\r\nThis year and the next, the State Department \r\nand the United States Agency for International \r\nDevelopment will commit more than $180 million \r\nto results-driven anti-trafficking foreign assistance. \r\nRecognizing the devastating impact of sex and labour \r\ntrafficking on children, the Department of State has \r\nalso established multi-year, bilateral child-protection \r\ncompact partnerships with the Governments of Ghana, \r\nthe Philippines and Peru to build effective systems of \r\njustice, prevention and child protection. Those are only \r\na snapshot of the range of programmes the United States \r\nhas to combat trafficking in persons domestically and \r\nabroad. In the past few years, we have also expanded \r\nour engagement with the business sector to prevent \r\nhuman trafficking in Government procurement and \r\nglobal supply chains.\r\nThe United States Government remains committed \r\nto helping survivors of trafficking, putting traffickers in \r\nprison and partnering with a broad range of stakeholders \r\nand Governments to prevent human trafficking from \r\noccurring. We look forward to the day when human \r\ntraffickers can no longer operate with impunity and \r\nthere are no more victims.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Australia.\r\nMs. Bird (Australia): The one key message that I \r\nwant to convey today is the importance of partnership \r\nand regional collaboration in combating trafficking in \r\npersons. No one can tackle the issue alone. Last week’s \r\nlaunch of the Global Estimates of Modern Slavery and \r\nChild Labour, hosted by Alliance 8.7, was a testament \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 9/31\r\nto the progress we can make when we work together. \r\nThe estimates were produced collaboratively by the \r\nInternational Labour Organization, the International \r\nOrganization for Migration, UNICEF and the Walk \r\nFree Foundation, with input from other United \r\nNations agencies.\r\nThe alarming figures telling us that more than \r\n40 million people — 70 per cent of them women — were \r\nvictims of modern slavery in 2016 send a clear message \r\nthat we will not be in a position to achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals unless we take urgent \r\naction. Australia welcomes collective efforts to improve \r\ninternational cooperation to address migration and \r\ndisplacement. Whenever people are on the move, they \r\nare vulnerable to exploitation. The global compacts on \r\nrefugees and migration will provide an opportunity \r\nto build international consensus for practical action. \r\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General’s call for the \r\nglobal compacts to provide solutions that protect the \r\nhuman rights of all.\r\nRegional action is critical. More than 50 per cent \r\nof the people of the world who are subject to forced \r\nlabour are in the Indo-Pacific region. Australia works \r\nclosely with its neighbours in South-East Asia to \r\ncombat trafficking and forced labour, and we fund the \r\nlargest single anti-trafficking investment in the region. \r\nWith Indonesia, Australia co-chairs the Bali Process on \r\nPeople Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related \r\nTransnational Crime. The Bali Process works to \r\nimprove practical cooperation for addressing regional \r\nchallenges. We recently launched the Bali Process \r\nBusiness Forum, a regional public-private partnership \r\nfor tackling trafficking and forced labour. Domestically, \r\nAustralia is establishing a new reporting requirement \r\nthat will require large businesses to publish annual \r\nstatements outlining their actions aimed at addressing \r\nmodern slavery in supply chains.\r\nWe applaud initiatives aimed at prevention, \r\nprotection and survivor assistance, which is why \r\nAustralia is a donor to the United Nations Voluntary \r\nTrust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, \r\nEspecially Women and Children, and the United \r\nNations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary \r\nForms of Slavery. However, I cannot conclude without \r\nvoicing deep concern for the lack of accountability and \r\ndisregard for safety demonstrated by human traffickers \r\nand people smugglers. They continue to exploit \r\nopportunities to mislead vulnerable people and we \r\nmust do more to hold them to account.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Cuba.\r\nMr. Reyes Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nSeven years after the General Assembly’s adoption of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons, that crime remains one of the \r\nmajor challenges facing the international community \r\nand a true insult to the dignity of people.\r\nOnly by promoting genuine international \r\ncooperation under strict observance of international \r\nlaw and the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, and based on the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime \r\nand its relevant Protocol, will we be able to agree on \r\nappropriate ways to combat trafficking in persons. The \r\npractice of producing unilateral assessment reports on \r\nother States is inadmissible and should be ended.\r\nThis problem is very rare in Cuba. In February, \r\nwe approved a national action plan for the period from \r\n2017 to 2020 for preventing and combating trafficking \r\nin persons and protecting its victims that coordinates \r\nState and civil-society organizations’ efforts to \r\neffectively implement our zero-tolerance policy for \r\ntrafficking in persons. In April, we received a visit from \r\nMs. Maria Grazia Giammarinaro, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, \r\nespecially women and children, enabling her to see at \r\nfirst hand the realities of the issue in our country.\r\nWe know that much remains to be done. However, \r\nCuba’s experience shows that it is possible to achieve \r\nresults in the fight against trafficking even with few \r\nresources, under a tight blockade and in the face of this \r\ncrime’s growing complexity and internationalization. \r\nThe social policies that we have implemented over \r\nalmost 60 years of revolution, along with prevention \r\nefforts and participation in them by the whole of society, \r\nwill continue to be keys to success.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Morocco.\r\nMr. Chekkori (Morocco) (spoke in French): \r\nToday’s meeting is taking place in an era marked by \r\nthe massive displacement of populations, particularly \r\nrefugees f leeing the horrors of war and natural disasters \r\nand migrants aspiring to a better future. As a result of \r\ntheir vulnerability, that population is exposed to the \r\nrisks of trafficking.\r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n10/31 17-30244\r\nOwing to Morocco’s geographical location and \r\nthe cross-border nature of this kind of crime, we have \r\nnot been spared this problem, particularly since our \r\nsituation as a country of origin, transit and destination \r\ncompels us to deploy increasing resources to protect \r\npotential victims of trafficking. We firmly believe \r\nthat today’s meeting and the adoption of the political \r\ndeclaration on the implementation of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \r\n(resolution 72/1) will help to galvanize the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts to prevent and combat all forms of \r\ntrafficking in persons.\r\nAmong the three elements of the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco’s new migration policy, launched in September \r\n2013, combating trafficking is one of my country’s \r\npriorities for protecting and promoting human rights and \r\nfighting organized crime. Through its national policy \r\non migration and asylum, Morocco is positioning itself \r\nas a leading regional player in the fight against human \r\ntrafficking and migrant smuggling. In its first phase, \r\nour policy has helped some 25,000 migrants regularize \r\ntheir status. The second phase will build on that success \r\nand what has already been achieved, and will help to \r\nfacilitate the migrants’ integration of migrants through \r\na comprehensive and humane approach aimed at \r\nprotecting migrants from human-trafficking networks \r\nand guaranteeing the rights of refugees and migrants \r\non Moroccan soil. Morocco has taken a series of \r\nmeasures at the national level by upgrading its legal \r\nand institutional framework relating to immigration, \r\nasylum and trafficking in human beings. Our adoption \r\nin 2016 of an anti-trafficking law is further proof of the \r\nKingdom’s active commitment.\r\nMorocco has also demonstrated its commitment \r\nin the international arena by subscribing to the main \r\nhuman rights conventions on preventing and combating \r\ntrafficking in persons and the smuggling of migrants, \r\nincluding the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime, and, in April 2011, \r\nby ratifying the Convention’s Additional Protocol to \r\nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, \r\nEspecially Women and Children. We have also presented \r\nour semi-annual plan of action for implementing the \r\nGlobal Programmes against Trafficking in Persons and \r\nSmuggling of Migrants at the twenty-sixth session of \r\nthe Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal \r\nJustice. Morocco is one of 13 countries around the \r\nworld strategically selected to develop and implement \r\nnational action against the trafficking and smuggling \r\nof migrants.\r\nExtreme poverty, inequality, conflict, political and \r\neconomic instability, human rights violations and a lack \r\nof education and opportunities create vulnerabilities that \r\ntraffickers never fail to exploit. No country can solve \r\nthe problem of trafficking alone. The solution does not \r\nlie in an exclusively security-based approach, but rather \r\nrequires a comprehensive, multisectoral approach and \r\nclose cooperation with countries of origin, transit \r\nand destination in tackling the root causes that lead \r\nthem to become victims of trafficking networks. The \r\npreventive aspect of trafficking is intrinsically linked \r\nto the commitment of all to sustainable development, \r\nand in that regard, Morocco reiterates its full support \r\nfor the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nWe take this opportunity to highlight the \r\npossibilities offered by the International Conference on \r\nMigration in 2018 and the contribution of the Global \r\nForum on Migration and Development, which Morocco \r\nco-chairs with Germany, and which provide appropriate \r\nopportunities to contribute to the implementation \r\nof the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons. We welcome the content of the Political \r\nDeclaration on the implementation of the Global Plan \r\nof Action (resolution 72/1), to which my country will \r\nactively contribute.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\ndeputy Chair of the delegation of Brazil.\r\nMr. Duque Estrada Meyer (Brazil): The scourge \r\nof human trafficking is one of the most terrible crimes \r\nknown to humankind and one of the most lucrative \r\nforms of transnational crime, along with trafficking in \r\ndrugs and arms. It mainly affects vulnerable people such \r\nas refugees, migrants and internally displaced persons, \r\nespecially women and girls, and those in situations \r\nof conflicts and natural disasters. Trafficked people \r\nare treated as objects and often subjected to sexual \r\nexploitation, domestic services or forced marriage.\r\nAs members of the international community, we \r\nmust strengthen our efforts to tackle this heinous crime \r\nand bring perpetrators to justice. In that regard, Brazil \r\nwelcomes this opportunity to conduct a fresh appraisal \r\nof the implementation of the United Nations Global \r\nPlan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons. We \r\nbelieve that a periodic review of the progress that has \r\nbeen made is essential to improving the coordination \r\nof our efforts in this area and bringing to our attention \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 11/31\r\nnew developments and challenges that have arisen in \r\nthe past few years.\r\nThis is also an occasion for us all to renew our \r\npolitical commitment to eradicating trafficking in \r\npersons, while recognizing the multifaceted nature \r\nof the problem. The political declaration on the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons (resolution \r\n72/1), which we adopted yesterday, reaffirms the \r\ncommitments of Member States in relation to the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, recognizing \r\nits integrated and indivisible nature, and thereby \r\nconfirming the synergy between our efforts to promote \r\ndevelopment, protect human rights and fight crime, \r\nparticularly trafficking in persons.\r\nBrazil is of the view that unduly restrictive \r\nimmigration policies can compound the effects of \r\nhuman trafficking. Adequate and effective strategies \r\nfor dealing with trafficking in persons must ensure that \r\nfundamental rights are respected. The discussions on a \r\nglobal compact for safe, orderly and regular migration \r\ncould therefore make an enormous contribution to \r\nour joint efforts to eliminate this heinous crime while \r\nsafeguarding the rights of those who legitimately seek \r\nbetter living standards in other countries.\r\nBrazil believes that a consistent global network \r\nfor protecting and assisting victims would discourage \r\ndemand and prevent re-victimization. Such assistance \r\nshould be gender- and age-sensitive and take into account \r\nthe special needs of vulnerable groups. In that regard, \r\nI would like to point out that last year Brazil adopted a \r\nnew national law on the prevention and suppression of \r\ndomestic and international trafficking in persons and \r\nmeasures designed to help protect and assist victims. \r\nIt defines trafficking in persons according to the \r\nparameters of the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, \r\nSuppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially \r\nWomen and Children, establishes severe penalties \r\nfor perpetrators and decrees that victims should have \r\nlegal, social, labour and health support as well as the \r\npossibility of being granted residence permits, whether \r\nor not they are cooperating with State criminal justice \r\nauthorities. We are also working on our third national \r\nplan to combat trafficking in persons, with the active \r\ninvolvement of civil society.\r\nBrazil attaches great importance to the efforts \r\nto enhance international cooperation on the issue of \r\nhuman trafficking undertaken by all Member States, as \r\nwell as by the Secretary-General, the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime, INTERPOL and other \r\nstrategic partners. We also commend the work of the \r\nInter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking \r\nin Persons and call for Member States’ enhanced \r\nengagement in its activities.\r\nIn conclusion, Brazil would like to recall that the \r\nspecific characteristics of trafficking in persons make \r\nit an issue that requires a multidisciplinary, integrated \r\nstrategy. Within the United Nations system, therefore, \r\nwe should strive for greater coordination by fostering \r\ncoherence in the efforts of the various entities involved \r\nand by ensuring that we keep the best interests and \r\nthe dignity of victims of trafficking at the centre of \r\nour policies.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Denmark.\r\nMr. Petersen (Denmark): Denmark fully aligns \r\nitself with the statement delivered yesterday by the \r\nobserver of the European Union (see A/72/PV.24), but \r\nsince the topic of this high-level meeting is an extremely \r\nimportant one, I am pleased to take this opportunity to \r\nmake a few comments in my national capacity.\r\nThe Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons is a significant instrument in the global \r\nfight against trafficking in persons. However, that \r\nwill be true only as long as we collectively secure \r\nits implementation, which is why we are here today \r\nto assess the achievements and identify the gaps and \r\nchallenges in this fight. Trafficking in persons is an \r\noffence to human dignity and a violation of fundamental \r\nfreedoms and human rights that knows no national \r\nborders, and combating it therefore requires a global \r\neffort. Together we must stop these cynical traffickers \r\nwho exploit people in extremely vulnerable situations \r\nand help and protect those who end up in their hands.\r\nDenmark is committed to doing its part. As a \r\ncandidate for the United Nations Human Rights Council \r\nfor the period from 2019 to 2021, we will continue \r\nto engage in normative work to advance efforts to \r\ncombat trafficking. Denmark was a sponsor of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2331 (2016), on trafficking in \r\npersons in conflict situations, and during the General \r\nAssembly high-level week last week we endorsed the \r\nUnited Kingdom-led call to action to end forced labour, \r\nmodern slavery and human trafficking. Denmark’s \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, together with partners \r\nfrom other Member States, hosted a side event that shed \r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n12/31 17-30244\r\nlight on trafficking and other forms of modern slavery. \r\nWe must raise awareness about the issue and make sure \r\nthat no one can ever say again that they did not know \r\nthat modern slavery existed.\r\nHuman trafficking now constitutes an increasing \r\npercentage of organized crime worldwide, which \r\nmeans that our efforts to combat it must be f lexible, \r\nable to adapt to new trends in order to help victims and \r\nprosecute traffickers effectively. That is why Denmark \r\nrecently decided to further strengthen its national \r\naction plan on combating human trafficking with an \r\nadditional $1.5 million in funds. We must and will \r\ncontinue to step up our game at the national as well as \r\nthe international level.\r\nThe United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for \r\nVictims of Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women \r\nand Children, plays an important role in our collective \r\nefforts, supporting direct specialized assistance to \r\nthe victims of all forms of human trafficking all \r\nover the world. I am therefore pleased to announce a \r\nDanish contribution of $160,000 to the Trust Fund. \r\nWe are proud to support this important effort to help \r\ninnocent victims.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Slovenia.\r\nMr. Čurin (Slovenia): Slovenia welcomes this \r\nhigh-level meeting and once again expresses its support \r\nfor the political declaration on the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons adopted yesterday (resolution \r\n72/1).\r\nSlovenia aligns itself with the statements delivered \r\nyesterday on behalf of the European Union and by \r\nthe representative of Panama on behalf of the Human \r\nSecurity Network (see A/72/PV.24). Owing to time \r\nconstraints, I will deliver a shortened version of my \r\nstatement, which will be available in full on PaperSmart.\r\nMore than a decade ago, trafficking in persons was \r\nseen as just one of the forms taken by international crime, \r\nbut today it is recognized as a multifaceted problem and \r\nhuman rights issue in its own right, constantly evolving, \r\nchanging and reaching increasingly severe dimensions. \r\nTrafficking in persons is based on the exploitation of \r\nother human beings. It affects all parts of society and \r\nis on its way to becoming a structural element in some \r\neconomies, but in particular it violates the fundamental \r\nrights, freedoms and dignity of its victims.\r\nThe fact is that trafficking in persons and related \r\nmodern forms of slavery are on the increase. The \r\nunderlying reasons include exploitive tendencies, a loss \r\nof values in our consumer societies, global poverty and \r\nthe increasing demand for cheap labour. Furthermore, \r\ntrafficking in persons is linked to other areas of social \r\nlife, such as current migration trends, and in that regard \r\nit is about exploiting the vulnerability of people who \r\nare on the move. At the same time, it has created new \r\nchallenges through its relationship to increasingly \r\nurgent security issues and economic threats.\r\nFor all those reasons, human trafficking is a \r\nmultidimensional issue and in that context, the Global \r\nPlan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \r\nrepresents a firm foundation for comprehensive \r\nmeasures at the national level. Slovenia therefore \r\nsupports global initiatives that should be reflected in \r\nmeasures taken at the national level in all areas of the \r\nfight against trafficking in persons. In 2002, Slovenia \r\nappointed a national anti-trafficking coordinator, \r\nassisted by an inter-ministerial working group, who \r\nplays a key role in the preparation and implementation \r\nof two-year action plans. The activities in those action \r\nplans address various preventive measures and funding \r\nfor non-governmental organizations involved in \r\nprogrammes for assisting victims.\r\nIn most cases, the prosecution of crimes related \r\nto trafficking in persons results in the conviction of \r\nthe offenders, and that has been established practice \r\nin Slovenia for the past eight years. The national \r\nreferral mechanism defines the proactive cooperation \r\nrequired between non-governmental organizations \r\nand law-enforcement authorities as well as with other \r\nrelevant organizations, taking into consideration \r\nthe victims’ best interests. Slovenia played a leading \r\nrole in implementing two European projects aimed at \r\ncombating trafficking in persons more effectively in \r\nthe territory of the Western Balkans and conducting \r\ntraining for law-enforcement authorities in the region.\r\nAlso, at Slovenia’s initiative an informal network \r\nof national anti-trafficking coordinators in South-\r\nEastern Europe was set up in 2010. The network, with \r\nthe support of the International Centre for Migration \r\nPolicy Development, is still active and meets twice \r\na year.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize once \r\nmore how crucial it is to fully understand the negative \r\neffects of human trafficking and the consequences of \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 13/31\r\nthe phenomenon for its victims, who suffer day after \r\nday, many of whom become victims more than once. \r\nAwareness of these things first needs to grow in the \r\nmind of each of us. Only then will we be able to use \r\nthe existing mechanisms and take effective action as a \r\nsociety and as institutions.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of Myanmar.\r\nMr. Suan (Myanmar): We welcome the adoption \r\nof the political declaration on the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons (resolution 72/1).\r\nThe menace of trafficking in persons — modern-\r\nday slavery — is increasingly threatening millions \r\nof people around the world. It is alarming to note \r\nthat the recent Global Report on Trafficking in \r\nPersons of the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime (UNODC) highlighted a significant increase \r\nin the number of victims trafficked for forced \r\nlabour — approximately four in 10 victims detected \r\nwere trafficked for that purpose. According to \r\nestimates from the International Labour Organization, \r\nmore than 20 million labourers are being exploited in \r\neconomic activities.\r\nTherefore we fully share the concern about this new \r\nphenomenon, which is a revival of slavery. It cannot \r\nbe resolved by actions of Governments alone. We \r\nneed to engage constructively with the private sector. \r\nIn this regard, I thank the Governments of Australia \r\nand Indonesia for their initiative in organizing the Bali \r\nProcess Government and Business Forum on 25 August \r\nin Perth, Australia.\r\nMyanmar has been fighting the issue of trafficking \r\nin persons as a national cause for 20 years, that is, \r\nsince 1997. As a source country of many trafficked \r\nvictims, Myanmar has stepped up its efforts to fight \r\ntrafficking in persons. We are focusing our actions in \r\nthe areas of prevention, protection and prosecution. The \r\nnumber of personnel dedicated to our anti-trafficking \r\nlaw-enforcement units has been increased. Awareness-\r\nraising activities have been conducted across \r\nthe country.\r\nThe Anti-Trafficking in Persons Law was enacted \r\nin Myanmar in 2005. Since then, we have put in place \r\nnational plans of action to combat trafficking in \r\npersons. We have reviewed our 2012-2016 National Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Human Trafficking and found five \r\ndistinct forms of human trafficking, namely, forced \r\nmarriage, forced labour, prostitution, child trafficking \r\nand debt bondage. A total of 237 forced-labour cases \r\noutside the country were detected in the period from \r\n2006 to 2017. The areas of activity where Myanmar \r\nmigrant workers suffer most from human trafficking \r\nand exploitation are fisheries, the seafood industry, \r\nagriculture, prostitution and domestic work.\r\nPoverty, overpopulation and the lack of job \r\nopportunities in many less-developed countries are \r\nindeed a push factor. At the same time, there are \r\nindustries hunting for cheap and unregulated labourers, \r\nwhich is obviously a demand, or pull, factor. In the \r\nabsence of inclusive and effective bilateral or regional \r\nmechanisms to address the issue, that vacuum is \r\nconveniently exploited by traffickers. The Government \r\nof Myanmar is therefore closely cooperating with the \r\ncountries in its region, particularly with the countries \r\nthat receive a large number of Myanmar migrant workers, \r\nby means of bilateral agreements and establishing other \r\nappropriate mechanisms for regularizing the status of \r\nthese workers.\r\nIn January 2017, Myanmar ratified the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations Convention against \r\nTrafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \r\nChildren. We are working closely not only with \r\ncountries in the region but also with United Nations \r\nagencies, particularly UNODC, in the fight against \r\ntrafficking in persons.\r\nWe also share the concern that people f leeing \r\nacross the border to Bangladesh could fall into the \r\nhands of traffickers. The terrorist attacks by the so-\r\ncalled Arankan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on \r\n25 August 2017 in northern Rakhine state have caused \r\nthe loss of lives and property and the displacement of \r\npeople. Many have f led across the border to Bangladesh. \r\nThere are several reasons for that exodus. Prominent \r\namong them is the fear factor. Following the terrorist \r\nattacks and the resultant security operations, most of \r\nthe women and children were forced to f lee. The men \r\nwere conscripted to join the ARSA in the fight against \r\nthe security forces. Many villagers were intimidated \r\ninto f leeing to the Bangladeshi side of the border so \r\nthat they could attract international attention. The \r\nscorched-earth policy employed by the terrorists is \r\nanother factor.\r\nMyanmar will do its utmost to prevent people from \r\nbecoming victims of traffickers. We all have to be alert \r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n14/31 17-30244\r\nand prevent any trafficker or criminal network from \r\nexploiting this situation. Myanmar is ready to work \r\nwith all countries to eliminate modern-day slavery.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of Austria.\r\nMr. Kickert (Austria): The fight against trafficking \r\nin persons requires greater resolve from us than ever. \r\nIt is a serious crime and a gross violation of human \r\nrights that continues to affect all regions of the world. \r\nThe testimony of survivors of trafficking, such as the \r\nstatement by Ms. Grizelda Grootboom yesterday (see \r\nA/72/PV.24), is a painful wake-up call for us to realize \r\nthat we continue to fail to protect the most vulnerable. \r\nWe, the community of States, have to try harder for the \r\nsake of those who are still suffering. We have to take \r\ncare of those who are at risk, vulnerable or exposed \r\nto arbitrary conditions. We have to stop impunity and \r\nbring perpetrators to justice.\r\nAustria is both a transit and destination country \r\nfor human trafficking. Human trafficking in Austria \r\npredominantly involves cases of sexual exploitation \r\nbut also labour exploitation and forced begging. A \r\ntask force on combating human trafficking comprising \r\nboth Government entities and non-governmental \r\norganizations elaborates national action plans with \r\nconcrete measures on how best to tackle trafficking \r\ncomprehensively and monitors the implementation of \r\nthose plans.\r\nRecently, Austria has been affected by large \r\nmixed migration movements. Against that backdrop, \r\nwe are paying particular attention to the interlinkages \r\nbetween migration movements and trafficking in \r\npersons. We have intensified measures to identify \r\nvictims or those at risk of being trafficked in order \r\nto prevent trafficking, assist victims and work more \r\neffectively to prosecute perpetrators. Furthermore, \r\nAustria is currently supporting projects of regional and \r\ninternational organizations dedicated to identifying and \r\nassisting victims of trafficking along migration routes. \r\nIn that context, we welcome the special attention that \r\nhas been given to the issue of trafficking in persons \r\nin the preparation process for the global compact for \r\nmigration, in particular in the framework of the fifth \r\ninformal thematic session that took place in Vienna just \r\nthree weeks ago.\r\nThe Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish \r\nTrafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \r\nChildren, supplementing the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime, \r\nremains the cornerstone of global action against human \r\ntrafficking, with its almost-universal ratification. \r\nThrough its comprehensive approach it defines and \r\nenables effective cooperation among States to prevent \r\nand combat trafficking and to protect and assist \r\nvictims. With the Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons, the issue has been kept high on \r\nthe international agenda. It has also encouraged States \r\nto ratify and effectively implement the provisions of \r\nthe Protocol.\r\nWe particularly commend the United Nations \r\nvoluntary trust fund for victims of trafficking, \r\nestablished through the Global Plan of Action, for its \r\nsuccessful work. It is an important instrument that \r\nmerits our continuous and strengthened support. The \r\nfund has facilitated direct assistance to approximately \r\n2,500 victims every year, but that is but a fraction of \r\nthe total number of victims. Many projects are waiting \r\nfor the necessary funds. Austria has contributed to the \r\nfund throughout the past years and will continue to do \r\nso this year, and the next and the ones to follow.\r\nAustria advocates for a victim-centred approach, \r\nwith a focus on preventing trafficking in persons and \r\nprotecting victims of trafficking or of other serious \r\nforms of exploitation. In many countries there is still \r\na lack of awareness that trafficked persons are not \r\noffenders. Unless they are identified and recognized as \r\nvictims of crime, they will be doubly punished.\r\nAnother important outcome of the Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons has been \r\nthe biennial Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, \r\nprepared by the United Nations Office on Drugs \r\nand Crime (UNODC). Data collection and analysis \r\nis indispensable to identify necessary and effective \r\nmeasures to counter trafficking in persons. In this \r\ncontext, Austria would like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress its support for the activities of UNODC in the \r\nfight against trafficking in persons and in assistinag \r\nMember States. In particular, UNODC assists Member \r\nStates in translating political will into concrete action. \r\nIt also coordinates multilateral efforts through the \r\nInter-Agency Coordination Group.\r\nWe very much welcome the presence of so many \r\ncivil-society participants among us. The expertise and \r\npractical support of non-governmental organizations \r\nare vital, especially in the context of victim protection \r\nand measures to prevent human trafficking. Moreover, \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 15/31\r\nnational human rights institutions, academia, the \r\nprivate sector and the media can and do play a central \r\nrole in the framework of the coordinated efforts to \r\ncombat human trafficking.\r\nTrafficking in persons has, if anything, become \r\nmore complex over the years. We cannot disregard the \r\nbroader context in which human trafficking evolves \r\nand that continues to nurture this inhumane business. \r\nWith the ongoing implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, we will create an environment \r\nmore conducive to helping address the root causes of \r\ntrafficking in persons.\r\nWhile, at this meeting we are taking stock of the \r\nprogress achieved in the past years, a lot of pressing \r\nwork and serious challenges lie ahead. Let us be guided \r\nby putting into action the word and spirit of the political \r\ndeclaration on the implementation of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \r\nthat we adopted. Today is the time to act, not tomorrow.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Portugal.\r\nMr. Albano (Portugal): Portugal is fully committed \r\nto the prevention of and fight against trafficking \r\nin persons.\r\nWe welcome the political declaration on the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons (resolution \r\n72/1) that the Assembly adopted. Portugal is proud to \r\nhave co-facilitated, together with Cabo Verde, the very \r\nfirst Global Action Plan, in 2010. All of our actions are \r\nin line with the most relevant international human rights \r\ninstruments and development frameworks, including \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nSince 2012, Portugal has been part of the Blue \r\nHeart Campaign against Human Trafficking, aimed at \r\nraising global awareness, and since then we proudly use \r\nthe Blue Heart in all national campaigns and actions. In \r\nspite of all the anti-trafficking initiatives developed in \r\nPortugal over the last decade, much more remains to be \r\ndone in the face of such a complex, multidimensional \r\nand constantly changing phenomenon.\r\nPortugal is currently starting to prepare its fourth \r\nnational action plan, which will consolidate a victim- \r\nand gender-based approach already contained in \r\nour first such plan. Portugal provides support to all \r\nvictims of trafficking in persons, both national and \r\nforeign. Victims have the right to subsistence, access to \r\nappropriate and urgent medical treatment, psychological \r\nassistance, protection, translation and interpretation \r\nservices and free legal advice under the stipulations of \r\nthe law. Portugal has three shelters that provide support \r\nto women and men identified as victims of trafficking, \r\nregardless of their nationality, age, religion, ethnicity, \r\nsexual orientation, disability, marital status, political \r\norientation, socioeconomic aspects or any other status. \r\nThat support is also extended to minor children of \r\nthe victims.\r\nThe implementation of the National Trafficking \r\nVictims Support and Protection Network was a decisive \r\nfactor in improving consolidation and coordination \r\namong Government institutions such as the police \r\nforces and the justice system, among others, and \r\ncivil society at the level of intervention with victims \r\nof trafficking. That network provides a mechanism \r\nfor cooperation and information-sharing among \r\nstakeholders for purposes of the prevention, protection \r\nand reintegration of victims of human trafficking. That \r\nis particularly relevant in regard to children, as they are \r\ndisproportionately vulnerable to trafficking in persons.\r\nThe creation in 2008 of the Observatory on \r\nTrafficking in Human Beings has allowed Portugal \r\nto reinforce its national referral mechanisms and to \r\nconsolidate data-collection systems and the exchange \r\nof information for the development of evidence-based \r\npolicies. We need to know how to intervene.\r\nAll Member States hold the collective \r\nresponsibility to combat this heinous crime. To do \r\nso, we need to cooperate and implement all the four \r\n“P’s” — prevention, protection, prosecution and, most \r\nimportantly, partnerships, as they will allow us to be \r\none step ahead of the criminal networks and traffickers \r\nresponsible for this global scourge.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Mexico.\r\nMs. Peláez (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I want to \r\ntake this opportunity, on my own behalf and on behalf \r\nof my country, to reiterate our appreciation for all the \r\nexpressions of solidarity we have received from the \r\ninternational community following the earthquakes \r\nin Mexico in recent weeks. We will not forget it. Our \r\nsympathy and support are with the countries affected \r\nby the recent hurricanes.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of Mexico, we welcome \r\nthe decision of the General Assembly to convene this \r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n16/31 17-30244\r\nmeeting to review progress in the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons and to jointly address the \r\nchallenges that persist and that are still before us. We \r\nrecognize that the factors linked to the disparate and \r\ninequitable development that led the United Nations to \r\napprove the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nare echoed in the undeniable relationship between \r\nmarginalization and inequality, which is a factor in \r\nthe victimization of people who are trafficked. That \r\nwas expressed in the political declaration on the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons (resolution \r\n72/1) approved yesterday, and that calls us to produce \r\npolicies of greater reach and aimed at the development \r\nof our nations and the people living in them.\r\nThe Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in \r\nPersons emphasizes the contribution made at regional \r\nlevels that complements and reinforces collective actions \r\nto combat this scourge, but we wish to emphasize the \r\nneed to align the objectives and strategies of the many \r\nglobal programmes and plans, thereby ensuring the \r\neffectiveness of national actions and the achievement \r\nof multilateral objectives.\r\nThe Government of Mexico, as an actor \r\nwith global responsibility, renews its support for \r\nmultilateral efforts to eradicate trafficking in persons \r\nand respects its commitment to the victims of these \r\ncrimes, implementing development policies centred \r\non the individual to attack extreme poverty, social \r\nexclusion, discrimination and lack of opportunities. \r\nWe are promoting social prevention of violence and \r\ndelinquency. Those measures will allow us to make \r\nprogress in implementing the commitments that we \r\nadopted in the 2030 Agenda and in the Global Plan \r\nof Action.\r\nThanks to the latter, we have a robust legal \r\nframework for assisting and protecting the victims of \r\nthese crimes. It incorporates a human rights perspective \r\nand gender and age considerations. We have increased \r\nsentences against traffickers, and in four years we have \r\ndoubled the number of investigations of these crimes. We \r\nare currently implementing a national anti-trafficking \r\nprogramme, and for the first time we have an integral \r\nreparation fund for the victims. The participation and \r\npartnership we have built with academic institutions \r\nand civil society to improve the work of the State are \r\nindispensable in these tasks.\r\nWe are aware of the challenges ahead. In order to \r\nmeasure and improve the performance of the Mexican \r\nState with regard to this crime, the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime carried out, at the request of \r\nthe Mexican Government, a national diagnosis. We are \r\nworking in coordination with states and municipalities \r\nto overcome the gaps identified and to strengthen local \r\ncapacities. As part of those efforts, we are setting up \r\nthe National Information System against Trafficking in \r\nPersons, which will give us a robust database. Among \r\nother things, that will align our care and protection \r\nservices for the victims with civil-society information, \r\nthus improving the generation of reports, tools and maps \r\nthat will heighten our investigation and prosecution \r\nactivities, on the one hand, and our prevention and \r\nprotection activities for the victims, on the other.\r\nTo intensify strategies for prevention and reporting \r\namong particularly vulnerable populations, with the \r\nsupport of the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime, we launched the Blue Heart 2.0 Campaign against \r\nTrafficking in Persons — Mexico#AquíEstoy — to give \r\na voice to the victims of these crimes and to promote a \r\nsingle national number for citizens to report them.\r\nMexico identifies as an important challenge within \r\nthe framework of the 2030 Agenda and the Global \r\nAction Plan the active participation of the productive \r\nsector. Industrialists, businesses and businesspeople, \r\nand workers’ unions should help make visible human \r\ntrafficking and exploitation in all its forms, and help \r\nfight it.\r\nTrafficking affects all regions of the world. It is a \r\nglobal phenomenon, so we must find local solutions as \r\ncountries of origin, transit and destination. According \r\nto data from the International Labour Organization, this \r\ncrime is one of the most lucrative areas for organized \r\ncrime. The formal production sector cannot remain \r\napart from efforts to make human trafficking visible.\r\nTrafficking and its profits are a product of the \r\npermanent violation of the right to dignity of persons. \r\nWe must be responsible as consumers, and States \r\nshould facilitate awareness-raising by establishing \r\nrules so that the goods and services that societies \r\nconsume are expressed in terms of human value. We \r\nmust transform our systems of consumption, giving \r\nproducers of goods and services incentives to make the \r\nvalue chains transparent. And we must invest more in \r\nthe human being. We must make the most of the ability \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 17/31\r\nof advertising and marketing to influence society, \r\nredirecting consumption to make it more responsible.\r\nWe urgently need to promote social mobilization in \r\nfavour of asserting the rights of all persons. We must \r\nrescue those who are being exploited. It depends on \r\nevery human being on the planet being aware of others, \r\nas the best way to make the status of servant and slave \r\nvanish from the face of the Earth. Until that time comes, \r\nevery human being who is aware of human trafficking \r\nmust contribute to its eradication.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Philippines.\r\nMr. Catapang (Philippines): Trafficking in persons \r\nis a heinous crime that victimizes the most vulnerable \r\nmembers of society. As we come together to examine \r\nour efforts, guided by the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons and the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, let us reaffirm \r\nour resolve to assist and protect the victims, prosecute \r\nand punish the perpetrators and end its occurrence.\r\nOver 10 million Filipinos work outside of the \r\nPhilippines. As that represents approximately 10 per cent \r\nof our population, it imperative for us to provide a mantle \r\nof protections for our Filipino migrants. The Philippines \r\nhas established a comprehensive mechanism to protect \r\nthem, based upon a framework of laws, regulations, \r\npolicies, programmes and institutions, using a migrant-\r\ncentred approach to the entire migration cycle, from \r\npre-employment, transit and on-site employment to \r\nreturn migration and reintegration.\r\nThrough the Migrant Workers Act, we have \r\nstrengthened the regulation of recruitment agencies \r\nto prevent abuse and maltreatment abroad and have \r\nprescribed minimum wages for our domestic workers \r\nthrough standardized contracts wherever possible. \r\nOn the other hand, the amended Anti-Trafficking \r\nAct criminalizes even attempted trafficking, making \r\nit punishable by imprisonment. The liabilities of \r\naccessories and accomplices to human trafficking \r\nactivities have also been spelled out.\r\nThe Philippines underscores the need for a creative, \r\nmultidisciplinary, multisectoral and comprehensive \r\napproach. To that end, the Government established the \r\nInter-Agency Council against trafficking, composed \r\nof representatives of relevant Government agencies, \r\ncivil society organizations, faith-based groups and the \r\nprivate sector, among others.\r\nConcerted efforts, especially through the Council, \r\nhave resulted in the successful prosecution of \r\nperpetrators of human trafficking. From 2005 to June \r\n2017, the Philippines has had a total of 297 convictions, \r\ninvolving 317 perpetrators. In 2016, for example, 44 \r\ncases of trafficking in persons produced 53 convictions, \r\n36 of which involved sentences to life imprisonment. \r\nJust from January to June this year, the Philippines has \r\nhad 23 convictions for human trafficking.\r\nFor the Philippines, our commitment to battle \r\ntrafficking in women and girls is manifest in our \r\nsubmission since 1994 of a General Assembly resolution \r\non trafficking in women and girls. Resolution 71/167 \r\nrecognizes the importance of a revitalized global \r\npartnership to ensure the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda. It calls for further work to understand the link \r\nbetween migration and trafficking in persons and to \r\ndevelop more effective responses to eliminate the risk \r\nof trafficking in the migration process.\r\nThat resolution also recognizes the heightened \r\nvulnerability to trafficking in humanitarian crisis \r\nsituations. In response, last year the Philippines passed \r\ninto law the Children’s Emergency Relief and Protection \r\nAct. It dictates that during a state of national or local \r\ncalamity, the police, military and Government-service \r\nproviders shall immediately undertake comprehensive \r\nmeasures and monitoring to prevent child trafficking \r\nfor labour or sexual exploitation.\r\nFor the Philippine Government, adopting an \r\napproach involving one country team and multiple \r\nstakeholders has proved to be effective. It consolidates \r\nthe mandates, efforts, resources and interests of the \r\nvarious duty-bearers and stakeholders in coming \r\nup with a robust response. It has also enabled us to \r\nmainstream the interventions down to the grass-roots \r\nlevel by activating local structures at the village, \r\ncity and municipal level, such as the Council against \r\nTrafficking and Violence against Women and Children.\r\nWe have also forged bilateral agreements with \r\nmigrant-destination countries to protect Filipino \r\nworkers, entered into a regional agreement in the \r\nAssociation for Southeast Asian Nations for closer \r\ncollaboration and pursued partnerships with multilateral \r\nagencies. We likewise actively participate in regional \r\nforums, such as the Australia-Asia Programme against \r\nTrafficking in Persons and the Bali Process on People \r\nSmuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related \r\nTransnational Crime.\r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n18/31 17-30244\r\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \r\n(UNODC) Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2016 \r\nhighlights the magnitude of this continuing problem. \r\nMore than ever, the need for a strong political will and \r\ndecisive, concerted action at the global level cannot be \r\noveremphasized. While we note a significant increase \r\nin the number of parties to the relevant United Nations \r\nconventions on trafficking in persons, we continue to \r\nurge those States that have not ratified them to finally \r\nconsider doing so. We appreciate the vital role of the \r\nUNODC in that respect, particularly in its efforts to \r\ncapacitate States by providing technical assistance.\r\nThe Philippines has been a supporter of the United \r\nNations voluntary trust fund to protect victims of \r\nhuman trafficking, recognizing its valuable work with \r\nsurvivors. As a gesture of our continuing commitment, \r\nthe Philippines commits to contributing a modest sum \r\nof $10,000 to that fund.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of Peru.\r\nMr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me at the outset to thank the Ambassadors of \r\nGreece, Qatar and Belgium for their excellent work as \r\nfacilitators of the resolution on modalities (resolution \r\n71/287) and the political declaration we adopted \r\nyesterday (resolution 72/1). In the political declaration, \r\nwe reaffirmed our will and commitment to the Global \r\nPlan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons and the \r\nobligations it sets out that we have assumed: preventing \r\ncrime, protecting and assisting victims, prosecuting \r\nperpetrators and reinforcing partnerships for more \r\nefficient and coherent joint action.\r\nTrafficking in persons is a phenomenon as complex \r\nas the horrors it generates, in which the individual, in \r\naddition to being deprived of freedom, is deprived of \r\nhumanity — exploited as a commodity in prostitution \r\nnetworks, performing forced labour or being a victim \r\nof the sale of organs to the highest bidder. In that \r\nregard, trafficking is embedded in various dynamics \r\nthat must be carefully addressed, such as its relation \r\nto other crimes; the use of social networks to capture \r\nthe victims; the greater vulnerability of women, \r\nadolescents, children, migrants and refugees; and in \r\nsome cases, its use in situations of armed conflict.\r\nWe in Peru have developed a national plan against \r\ntrafficking in persons 2017-2021, framed in the United \r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime and its Protocols, adopted in Palermo, Italy. Our \r\nplan deploys a compete, comprehensive and coordinated \r\nstrategy. It is complete because of its focus on four axes of \r\npriority: caring for the victims; governance, prevention \r\nand awareness-raising; protection and reintegration; \r\nand investigation and prosecution. It is comprehensive \r\nbecause trafficking in persons is related to other crimes, \r\nsuch as the illegal smuggling of migrants, and we also \r\ntake into account the structural elements that lead to \r\ngreater vulnerability. And it is coordinated because we \r\nmust strengthen the collaboration between the different \r\nlevels of government and civil-society participation.\r\nGovernments have a great responsibility, but \r\nwe cannot fight this fight alone. The support of the \r\nUnited Nations is indispensable, and the role of the \r\nInter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking \r\nin Persons (ICAT) is crucial for consistency. We would \r\nlike to take the opportunity to welcome the work of all \r\nof the members of ICAT, especially the coordinating \r\nrole of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, \r\nwhich also publishes the Global Report on Trafficking \r\nin Persons, which is very useful to us.\r\nThe specific circumstances and common \r\nchallenges in certain regions underscore the relevance \r\nof also providing support to regional organizations, \r\nfor example, the Second Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in persons in the Western Hemisphere 2015-\r\n2018. Among the objectives of that Plan are increasing \r\nawareness of the population and reducing situations of \r\nvulnerability to prevent crime.\r\nOn the bilateral level, I would like to highlight \r\nthe initiative of the so-called legal protection belts \r\nagainst trafficking in persons, which we have been \r\nimplementing with our neighbouring countries.\r\nTo conclude, let me reaffirm Peru’s commitment \r\nto implementing the Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons and my delegation’s commitment \r\nto constructively participating in the review processes.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of Paraguay.\r\nMr. Arriola Ramírez (Paraguay) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The Republic of Paraguay joins the voices \r\ncondemning trafficking in persons — a crime that \r\nviolates human dignity. It is incompatible with respect \r\nfor human rights and has harmful effects on the \r\nsustainable development of States and on the promotion \r\nof peaceful, just and inclusive societies, free of fear \r\nand violence.\r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 19/31\r\nIn accordance with our international obligations, \r\nParaguay has adopted specific measures to prevent \r\nand punish this crime. Since 2005, we have had an \r\ninter-institutional bureau, composed of governmental \r\ninstitutions, civil society and international \r\norganizations. In a coordinated and collaborative \r\nmanner, it undertakes actions for a multidimensional \r\napproach to trafficking in persons.\r\nIn terms of public policies, the National Policy on \r\nPreventing and Combating Trafficking in Persons is \r\nin force. It establishes the principles, approaches and \r\nstrategic axes for prevention, investigation, criminal \r\nsanctions, protection and comprehensive care of \r\nvictims. Its principles prioritize caring for children \r\nand adolescents. Similarly, in 2012 the comprehensive \r\nlaw against trafficking in persons was enacted. It aims \r\nto prevent and punish that crime, whether within the \r\ncountry or abroad, and it provides a framework of \r\ncomprehensive protection for victims, whether primary \r\nor secondary.\r\nFurthermore, in my country the expected maximum \r\nsentence is up to 20 years in prison for those who \r\ncapture, transport, transfer or receive direct victims \r\nof trafficking. Moreover, I would highlight the recent \r\nadoption of the National Plan for the Prevention and \r\nCombating of Trafficking in Persons. It is a tool that \r\ndraws up the road map for institutions responsible \r\nfor dealing with structural problems that expose \r\npeople to situations that make them vulnerable to \r\nhuman trafficking.\r\nWith respect to mixed migratory movements, the \r\nmission of Paraguay, through the National Commission \r\nfor Refugees, is to provide protection and assistance \r\nto potential victims of trafficking in persons from \r\nsuch movements.\r\nTrafficking in persons affects all countries and \r\nregions, but it strikes harder at those for whom the \r\nfactors that make people most vulnerable to this \r\ncrime — poverty, unemployment, lack of socioeconomic \r\nopportunities, gender violence, discrimination and \r\nmarginalization — are a constant reality.\r\nParaguay calls on the international community to \r\ngive due consideration to the following issues.\r\nFirst, migration should not be criminalized, and \r\na security approach to it should be eschewed. States \r\nshould promote open, safe and regular migration \r\nchannels, which would contribute to the eradication \r\nof trafficking in persons. Secondly, the link between \r\ntrafficking in persons and drug trafficking cannot \r\nremain invisible. Thirdly, trafficking for the purpose \r\nof labour exploitation must be expressly included in \r\ninternational instruments and national legislation as \r\na criminal offense, so that the criminal prosecution \r\nof offenders is effective. Fourthly, cooperation among \r\nStates is essential, especially as regards assistance, the \r\nrepatriation of victims and transnational prosecution of \r\nthe crime.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate Paraguay’s commitment \r\nto combating all forms of trafficking in persons, and I \r\nexpress our willingness to continue to collaborate with \r\nregional and international efforts aimed at that goal.\r\nYesterday I was awarded this Blue Heart for \r\nthe expertise of my delegation. They explained its \r\nsignificance to me, and I would like to make an appeal \r\nin that regard. It is of utmost importance that, in addition \r\nto wearing such a pin on our lapels, we hold this issue \r\nclose to our hearts, at the forefront of our minds and \r\nin our actions, so that we will be able to successfully \r\nfight this scourge, which affects all of our countries and \r\nconstitutes a true attack on human dignity.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of India.\r\nMr. Govind (India): At the outset, on behalf of \r\nmy country, let me convey our deep appreciation for \r\nthe commendable efforts made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Qatar and Belgium, as co-facilitators \r\nof resolution 72/1, helping us to translate our collective \r\ncommitment into a political declaration on the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons. I would \r\nalso thank the President for organizing this high-\r\nlevel meeting.\r\nA deliberation on combating trafficking has special \r\nsignificance today, as the mass exodus of people in \r\ndistress in different parts of the world is making them \r\nincreasingly vulnerable to trafficking.\r\nWe have progressed since the adoption of the United \r\nNations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons in July 2010. The four Ps — prevention, \r\nprotection, prosecution and partnership — have become \r\nthe keystones of institutional architecture at national, \r\nregional and international levels.\r\nThe Government of India has accorded the highest \r\npriority to combating trafficking. It has adopted \r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n20/31 17-30244\r\na multi-pronged and multi-stakeholder approach \r\nto tackling this multidimensional problem. Those \r\nholistic steps and strategies are not restricted to direct \r\nintervention against trafficking in isolation. India’s \r\nanti-trafficking legislative framework is based on the \r\nbedrock of article 23 of our Constitution, which prohibits \r\ntrafficking and forced labour. India has a strong and \r\neffective legislative framework to address the issue of \r\ntrafficking, including the protection of children and \r\nwomen from sexual exploitation and the prohibition \r\nof bonded and child labour, the transplantation of \r\nhuman organs and selling and buying for the purpose \r\nof prostitution.\r\nWith the amendment of our criminal law in 2013, \r\ntrafficking has been defined comprehensively and \r\nprovisions have been made for the stringent punishment \r\nof traffickers. We have also initiated the process of \r\nformulating comprehensive legislation on trafficking \r\nof persons, covering all of its aspects, including \r\nprosecution, prevention; protection of victims, \r\nwitnesses and complainants; and the rehabilitation \r\nof victims.\r\nFor the prevention and faster investigation of crimes \r\nof trafficking, 264 anti-human-trafficking units and \r\n150 specialized investigative units for crime against \r\nwomen have been set up across the country. Capacity-\r\nbuilding of law-enforcement agencies and the judiciary \r\nto ensure a faster criminal justice response has been \r\naccorded high priority.\r\nA comprehensive scheme entitled Ujjwala, \r\nmeaning “bright future”, has been introduced to \r\nfacilitate the rescue, rehabilitation and reintegration of \r\ntrafficking victims. It also facilitates the repatriation \r\nof cross-border victims. Special drives, such as \r\nOperation Smile, are conducted regularly for rescued \r\ntrafficked children. Innovative use of information \r\ntechnology, such as the Track Child and Khoya-Paya \r\nportals, and strong standard operating procedures for \r\nlaw-enforcement agencies have been met with success. \r\nSimilarly, railways have also issued standard operating \r\nprocedures, in accordance with the Juvenile Justice \r\n(Care and Protection of Children) Act of 2000.\r\nIndia’s endeavour is to eradicate trafficking by \r\nempowering the vulnerable sections of our society, \r\nincluding through the effective implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. In order to strengthen \r\ninternational cooperation, India signed the South Asian \r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation Convention \r\non Preventing and Combating the Trafficking in \r\nWomen and Children for Prostitution and bilateral \r\nmemorandums of understanding with the Government \r\nof Bangladesh in 2015 and with the United Arab \r\nEmirates in January 2017.\r\nDespite collective efforts at the national, regional \r\nand international levels, the battle against the scourge \r\nof human trafficking is far from over. In implementing \r\nthe Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in \r\nPersons within the framework of the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime \r\nand its Supplementary Protocols — of which India is a \r\nsignatory — the focus also needs to be on development \r\nissues in the countries of origin and demand for \r\ntrafficked persons for exploitative purposes in \r\ndestination countries.\r\nWe need to redouble our efforts and adopt a \r\nmulti-pronged strategy. India stands firmly committed \r\nto working with the international community in its \r\nbattle against trafficking in persons.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of Cameroon.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): It should be recalled that this high-level \r\nmeeting follows the decision of the General Assembly \r\nin 2013 to evaluate the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons, adopted in \r\n2010, every four years. It should be underlined that \r\nthe Global Plan is an expression of Member States’ \r\nfirm determination to prevent and combat trafficking, \r\nprotect and assist victims, prosecute their perpetrators \r\nand foster partnerships to strengthen coordination and \r\ncooperation in that area.\r\nTrafficking in human beings is exacerbated by the \r\nincrease in migratory movements. Those movements \r\nplace migrants in a precarious and vulnerable situation \r\nthat encourages trafficking in human beings, especially \r\nwomen and children. At a time when terrorism is \r\nincreasing in all parts of the world, migrants, refugees \r\nand displaced persons are the most sought-after targets \r\nfor all kinds of abuses.\r\nThe actions of the terrorist sect Boko Haram, \r\nwhich is affiliated with the powerful jihadist movement \r\nDa’esh, provide a strong example of that. In what could \r\nbe called a new form of trafficking in human beings, that \r\nsect recruits or kidnaps, by force or with the promise of \r\nmoney, girls and boys, often adolescents. Sometimes \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 21/31\r\nthose adolescents are exchanged for ransom, sometimes \r\nthey are forcibly married or reduced to sexual slavery. \r\nSometimes they are indoctrinated, including through \r\nphysical abuse and threats of death or even execution, \r\nwhether by drugs or explosives belts and being sent \r\nas human bombs into civilian populations, places of \r\nworship, markets, festivities or funerals. On 25 January \r\n2016, four young female kamikazes exploded their \r\nbombs in a market in the extreme north of my country, \r\nkilling 32 people and wounding more than 60.\r\nThat underscores the importance of implementing \r\nthe Global Plan of Action to combat this scourge. \r\nCameroon is firmly committed in that regard, and our \r\ncountry has taken steps to effectively combat all forms \r\nof trafficking. Those steps include the strengthening of \r\nthe political, institutional and legal frameworks. They \r\nalso include awareness-raising, education, training and \r\nprotection and care for victims, and repression.\r\nIn that regard, our country has reaffirmed the \r\nprincipal international conventions on the issue, \r\nparticularly the 1949 Convention for the Suppression \r\nof the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the \r\nProstitution of Others, the Abolition of Forced Labour \r\nConvention No. 105 and the Minimum Age Convention \r\nNo. 138 of the International Labour Organization, and \r\nthe United Nations Convention against Transnational \r\nOrganized Crime and the Protocols thereto.\r\nOn 14 December 2011, Cameroon adopted a law on \r\ncombating trafficking in persons. It regularly organizes \r\nawareness-raising and information campaigns in the \r\nmost exposed regions of the country. All of those actions \r\nare coordinated, at the level of the Prime Minister, by \r\nan interministerial committee created for that purpose.\r\nIn addition, in order to increase the visibility and \r\ncoordination of our actions to combat human trafficking \r\nat the regional level, our country is part of the group \r\nof West and Central African States, which has set up \r\nmultidisciplinary coordination structures. The roles \r\nassigned to those structures include the collection of \r\ninformation on the treatment of persons, coordination \r\nof the efforts of Governments and partners, the \r\ncollection of data, the protection of victims and, in \r\nsome countries, the investigation and prosecution of \r\nperpetrators of such crimes. That initiative enjoys the \r\ntechnical support of the United Nations Office on Drugs \r\nand Crime, which my country wishes to commend once \r\nagain. We also call for contributions to the fund set up \r\nto aid victims of trafficking in order to provide victims \r\nwith the assistance and protection that they need.\r\nIn the light of all that is ongoing, my country fully \r\naligns itself with the political declaration (resolution \r\n72/1) adopted by consensus at the high-level meeting, \r\nwhich is aimed at giving new impetus to all actions \r\ntaken at the national, regional and global levels to \r\ncombat trafficking in human beings, as envisaged in the \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \r\nof 2010. Human dignity is at stake, and it should not \r\nsuffer any harm.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of the Bahamas.\r\nMs. Carey (Bahamas): As an archipelagic nation \r\nwith a vast ocean area, the Bahamas experiences large \r\nmixed migration from within the Caribbean region \r\nand from South and Central America, Europe and \r\nAsia. Because we are geographically located next to a \r\nmajor destination country, our porous borders render \r\nus ideally suited as a transit point for illicit trafficking \r\nactivities. Trafficking in persons is no exception.\r\nThe Bahamas considers trafficking in persons \r\na heinous crime. Accordingly, we have committed \r\nto taking a very proactive approach to combat it. In \r\nSeptember 2008, the Bahamas became a party to the \r\nUnited Nations Convention against Transnational \r\nOrganized Crime and the Protocols thereto. In 2008, \r\nthe Bahamas enacted the trafficking in persons \r\nprevention and suppression act, a comprehensive \r\nand wide-ranging piece of legislation that, inter alia, \r\ncriminalizes trafficking in persons and prescribes \r\nstrict penalties for all aspects of the crime, including \r\nwithholding of travel documents and work permits. \r\nThe legislation includes the full range of protection \r\nfor victims of trafficking, including exemption from \r\ncustomary immigration sanctions.\r\nIn collaboration with the non-governmental \r\norganization (NGO) community, the Government \r\nof the Bahamas produced the Government of \r\nthe Commonwealth of the Bahamas National \r\nAnti-trafficking in Persons Strategy for the period \r\n2014-2018. The Strategy is intended to engender \r\ncollective understanding and coordinated action among \r\nstakeholders and actors and to ensure the financial \r\nsupport of local and international donors. It ref lects \r\nthe guiding principles of the efforts of the Bahamas \r\nto combat trafficking in persons, including civil-\r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n22/31 17-30244\r\nsociety participation, observance of human rights, and \r\ninterdisciplinary and cross-sectional approaches.\r\nSeveral national bodies on trafficking in persons \r\nhave been established in the Bahamas, including a \r\ncoordinating group for policy matters, a task force \r\nresponsible for operational matters and units in the \r\noffice of the Attorney General and the Royal Bahamas \r\nPolice Force. The Government of the Bahamas, in \r\ncollaboration with the NGO community, is conducting \r\na nationwide campaign to raise public awareness about \r\ntrafficking in persons in the Bahamas, through education \r\nprogrammes for students, vulnerable populations, \r\nthe business community, the public and Government \r\nofficials. The Department of Labour screens for \r\nindicators of trafficking when inspecting worksites. \r\nIt also advises job seekers about potential fraudulent \r\nrecruitment practices in tourism-related industries.\r\nGeneral standing operating procedures for victim \r\nidentification, protection and referral and specific \r\nprocedures for data collection and victim care have been \r\ndeveloped. The Government has increased funding for \r\nvictim assistance, initiated several labour- and sex-\r\ntrafficking investigations, screened potential victims \r\nand identified several trafficking victims. In August, \r\ntwo people were convicted of trafficking-in-persons \r\noffences, and several trials are ongoing, both in \r\nthe Magistrate’s Court and in the Supreme Court. \r\nIn addition, the Bahamas’ action plan relative to \r\ncombating trafficking in persons has been adopted by \r\nother Caribbean countries as a model.\r\nThe sample of initiatives I just mentioned \r\ndemonstrates that the Bahamas is very serious about \r\neliminating trafficking in persons. While we have \r\nmade significant strides in that regard, including the \r\nenhancement of legislative and policy environments, \r\nthe Bahamian Government will continue to promote \r\nstrong collaboration across multiple Government \r\nagencies to facilitate the prosecution of traffickers and \r\nthe protection of victims.\r\nRecognizing the vast reach of human trafficking \r\nrings and their links with drug trafficking, money-\r\nlaundering, terrorism financing and illegal migration \r\nnetworks, we believe that trafficking in persons is \r\nan issue that must be addressed by the international \r\ncommunity. With our limited resources, we cannot \r\ncombat by ourselves a crime that operates on a global \r\nscale. The Bahamas believes that it is only through \r\nglobal partnership that we can secure a sustainable and \r\npeaceful future.\r\nWe are pleased about the adoption yesterday of the \r\npolitical declaration on the implementation of the United \r\nNations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons (resolution 72/1), and pleased to participate \r\nin this high-level meeting on trafficking in persons. \r\nWe look forward to continuing dialogue on ways to \r\nfoster international coordination and cooperation in \r\npreventing and combating trafficking in persons and \r\nprotecting victims of such trafficking.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Jung Min Seo (Republic of Korea): On behalf \r\nof the Government of the Republic of Korea, I would \r\nlike to extend my sincere appreciation to the United \r\nNations for its tireless efforts aimed at combating \r\nhuman trafficking and for convening this high-level \r\nmeeting. I also welcome the adoption of the political \r\ndeclaration on the implementation of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \r\n(resolution 72/1), which emphasizes our unified will to \r\ncope with this issue.\r\nSeven years have elapsed since the General \r\nAssembly adopted the Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons. The Global Plan remains \r\nan important framework in addressing this ongoing \r\nchallenge. This heinous and multifaceted crime preys \r\non vulnerable individuals and thrives in situations of \r\nconflict. The United Nations Global Plan of Action \r\nis designed to effectively tackle this serious human \r\nrights crime in terms of preventing human trafficking, \r\nprotecting and assisting victims, prosecuting \r\nperpetrators and strengthening partnerships.\r\nThe Korean Government supports the Global \r\nPlan of Action and has taken measures to put an \r\nend to trafficking in persons in accordance with \r\nthe United Nations blueprint. In 2013, we codified \r\nhuman trafficking as a serious crime in our domestic \r\nlegislation. In 2015, we ratified the Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to \r\nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, \r\nEspecially Women and Children.\r\nPrevention plays a large role in bringing about an \r\nend to this crime. Prevention involves capacity-building \r\nat the national level and addressing social inequalities \r\nand gender discrimination, among other root causes. In \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 23/31\r\nthat regard, Korea believes that, in order to strengthen \r\nour ability to prevent this crime, the best practices and \r\nlessons learned in countering human trafficking should \r\nbe more actively shared and promoted across the globe.\r\nAnother important aspect is the protection of, \r\nand assistance for, victims. This crime often targets \r\nsociety’s most vulnerable members, making it all the \r\nmore necessary for policies to be formulated using a \r\nvictim-centred approach.\r\nThe strengthening of partnerships is also \r\nimportant, since human trafficking is by its very nature \r\na transnational activity. The perpetrators of these \r\ncrimes thrive in the shadows of lawlessness and must \r\nbe brought to justice through the coordinated efforts of \r\nMember States.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to emphasize its \r\npolicy support for the public-sector, private-sector and \r\ncivil-society entities that are fully and cooperatively \r\nengaged in the fight against trafficking in persons. \r\nThe Korean Government believes that the United \r\nNations Global Plan of Action rightly stresses the need \r\nfor partnership-building and fully supports United \r\nNations efforts aimed at encouraging cooperation at all \r\nlevels, promoting effective mutual legal assistance and \r\ncriminal extradition, strengthening public-private and \r\ncivil-society partnerships and bolstering cooperation \r\namong law-enforcement agencies. My Government \r\nrecognizes the urgency of this challenge and is \r\ncommitted to providing its full support in a fight that \r\npits the darkest elements of our society against its most \r\nvulnerable elements.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\ndeputy Chair of the delegation of the Federal Republic \r\nof Germany.\r\nMr. Schulz (Germany): I would like to thank the \r\nfacilitators, Qatar and Belgium, for their efforts in \r\npreparing this important event. The call of the political \r\ndeclaration on the implementation of the Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons (resolution \r\n72/1) will provide a new stimulus in our efforts to fight \r\nhuman trafficking of all kinds, including forced labour, \r\nslavery and similar practices. I would like to make \r\nthree major points.\r\nFirst, I would like to underline Germany’s strong \r\ncommitment to combating human trafficking. Our \r\nresolutions in the Human Rights Council, submitted \r\ntogether with the Philippines, are based on our firm \r\nbelief that victims of trafficking need to be protected \r\nand assisted, with full respect for their human rights. \r\nTraffickers treat their victims as mere commodities to \r\ncreate as much profit as possible, or sometimes even to \r\nsatisfy a sadistic craving for power. Surely we cannot \r\nlet such a gross abuse of human dignity continue in \r\nour time. We as States must ensure that we effectively \r\nimplement existing international standards to protect \r\nthe human rights of the victims. We must also ensure \r\nthat victims have access to remedies to address alleged \r\nabuses and violations without fear of blacklisting, \r\ndetention or deportation.\r\nGermany is co-financing various projects to \r\ncombat trafficking in human beings, for example, in \r\nMauritania and the Central African Republic, along \r\nwith the International Organization for Migration, \r\nand in the Sahel region, with INTERPOL. We have \r\nalso invited Ms. Nadia Ahmed, the Yazidi human \r\nrights activist and the first Goodwill Ambassador for \r\nthe Dignity of Survivors of Human Trafficking of the \r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and some \r\n1,000 other traumatized refugees from northern Iraq, \r\nto Germany.\r\nSecondly, human trafficking is often a transnational \r\ncrime that can be fought only through international \r\ncooperation in the areas of prevention, prosecution and \r\nvictim protection. The necessity to cooperate becomes \r\nmore pressing as we see the number of refugees and \r\nmigrants worldwide increase and acknowledge that \r\nthey are particularly vulnerable and may easily fall \r\nprey to traffickers. The basis for our cooperation is \r\nthe United Nations Convention against Transnational \r\nOrganized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress \r\nand Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women \r\nand Children. We should all ratify and implement these \r\nlegal instruments in order to ensure strong foundations \r\nfor the rule of law.\r\nMy third, and last, point is that preventing \r\nhuman trafficking has many facets. If we take labour \r\nexploitation as an example, millions of people are part \r\nof global supply chains, and some of them work in \r\nexploitative and often harmful or dangerous conditions. \r\nCompanies with international supplier chains have a \r\nresponsibility to ensure good working conditions for \r\ntheir employees. The German 2016 national action \r\nplan on business and human rights expects companies \r\nto exercise human rights due diligence. The action \r\nplan and our 2014 partnership for sustainable textiles \r\ninitiative are just two examples of the endeavours we \r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n24/31 17-30244\r\nhave undertaken to improve trade and supply-chain \r\nstandards and to fight labour exploitation worldwide.\r\nHuman trafficking is despicable because of the \r\nsuffering it inflicts on the most vulnerable. Let us \r\nredouble our efforts to protect victims and fight human \r\ntrafficking in all its forms.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor the \r\nChair of the delegation of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Our delegation welcomes the adoption \r\nby consensus of the political declaration on the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global \r\nPlan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \r\n(resolution 72/1).\r\n We align ourselves with the joint statement made \r\non behalf of the Group of Friends United against Human \r\nTrafficking (see A/72/PV.24), and we note the active \r\nefforts of the delegation of Belarus in coordinating the \r\nGroup’s work.\r\nTangible results in fighting a threat as serious \r\nas human trafficking can be achieved only if there is \r\npolitical will, a joining of Government efforts with \r\nthose of business and civil society, and balanced \r\nattention given to the countries of origin and destination \r\nof these living commodities. In today’s world, there is \r\ngrowing understanding of the fact that a comprehensive \r\napproach that includes prevention, assistance for \r\nvictims and prosecution of perpetrators is needed to \r\naddress the problem of trafficking. Human trafficking \r\nis linked to continuing disparities in the socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment of countries and regions, greater f lows of \r\nrefugees and illegal migrants, and increased activity \r\namong international criminal organizations. In the \r\ncontext of the work to prevent human trafficking, it \r\nis necessary to eradicate the root causes, in particular \r\na legalized sex industry, the demand for a cheap and \r\ndisenfranchised workforce, poverty and unemployment.\r\nOur country is a signatory to many international \r\ntreaties on this issue. In July in Moscow, the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\nand the Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs held an \r\ninternational conference on public-private partnerships \r\nto combat human trafficking. It brought together 200 \r\nparticipants from 40 States. The meeting provided us \r\nwith an opportunity to hold a meaningful discussion \r\non the scope and consequences of human trafficking \r\nand labour exploitation for private business, the role \r\nof Governments and the private sector in combating \r\nthis phenomenon and the existing international \r\ninstruments adopted to that end. Russia is an active \r\nparticipant in a related thematic programme sponsored \r\nby the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) \r\ndesigned, inter alia, to improve and streamline national \r\nlegislation on combating human trafficking and \r\nproviding assistance to victims. We regularly provide \r\nresources for staff-training projects undertaken by \r\nthe International Training Centre for Migration and \r\nCombating Trafficking in Human Beings. Located in \r\nMinsk, it is the main organization of the countries of \r\nthe CIS in this field.\r\nThe United Nations must play a central role \r\nin uniting the efforts of international and national \r\nentities established to combat human trafficking, and \r\nwe acknowledge the consistent efforts of the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime in this area. Of \r\nparticular importance is the assistance that it provides \r\nto interested States for the purposes of combating \r\nexisting problems.\r\nWhile we believe that each country has the right to \r\ndefine the national mechanism that is optimal for it in \r\nthe fight against human trafficking, we also support the \r\ndevelopment and capacity-building activities that the \r\nInter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking \r\nin Persons and its member organizations provide in the \r\nimplementation of the Global Plan of Action. We are \r\nconvinced that the Global Plan will remain an effective \r\nroad map and a major guide for the international \r\ncommunity as a whole as it strives to combat these \r\ncriminal commercial activities. We hope that the \r\ndiscussion at this high-level meeting will facilitate \r\nprogress in this area.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan.\r\nMr. Hashmi (Pakistan): Pakistan welcomes this \r\nhigh-level meeting. We reiterate our strong support \r\nfor and commitment to bringing an end to the heinous \r\ncrime of trafficking in persons, especially women and \r\nchildren. We also welcome the adoption of the political \r\ndeclaration on the implementation of the United \r\nNations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in \r\nPersons, which was adopted yesterday (resolution 72/1).\r\nTrafficking in persons continues to be one of the \r\nmost serious offences. It violates the human rights of \r\nthe individual and undermines peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. It is an egregious violation of the principles \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 25/31\r\nof human dignity and integrity and threatens the rule \r\nof law. Trafficking in persons, especially women and \r\nchildren, is condemnable in all its forms, including \r\nsexual exploitation, debt bondage, organ removal and \r\nforced labour. The transnational nature of this complex \r\ncrime calls for enhanced international cooperation \r\namong countries of origin, transit and destination.\r\nGiven the present large-scale displacement of \r\nhuman beings occurring in several regions of the world, \r\nthis issue has taken on greater relevance and importance \r\nthan ever. It is therefore crucial that countries of origin, \r\ntransit and destination do all they can to halt and reverse \r\nsuch trafficking. A pervasive sense of despondency \r\nand lack of prospects induced by protracted conflict \r\nand insecurity lies at the core of this phenomenon. To \r\nsuccessfully combat trafficking in persons, Member \r\nStates need to address the root causes and drivers of \r\ntrafficking, such as poverty, inequality and protracted \r\nconflict. Sustainable solutions require the redoubling \r\nof efforts aimed at addressing the demand side of \r\nthe equation.\r\nThe United Nations Convention against Transnational \r\nOrganized Crime, together with the Protocol on \r\nTrafficking in Persons, has served as a centrepiece of \r\nthe existing global framework to combat this challenge. \r\nThe adoption of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons in 2010 was \r\nan important step in our collective fight against this \r\nform of organized crime.\r\nThe holistic approach, predicated on components \r\nof prevention, protection, prosecution and partnership, \r\ncontinues to be a blueprint for concerted efforts at all \r\nlevels. We need to forge a victim-centred approach and \r\nscale up efforts to identify and protect those in need of \r\nour assistance. International resolve and commitment \r\nis the sine qua non for removing the bottlenecks and \r\nobstacles in the proper implementation of the relevant \r\nlaws and conventions. The provision of financial and \r\ntechnical support to developing countries can help \r\nthem to streamline processes, improve data-collection \r\nand sharing mechanisms, and implement projects at the \r\ngrass-roots level.\r\nPakistan has adopted a range of legislative and \r\nregulatory measures. We have drafted a national \r\naction plan for combating human trafficking, which \r\nis a comprehensive policy document on trafficking in \r\npersons. We are currently implementing our strategic \r\nframework document for the period 2016-2022. In \r\naddition, Pakistan is a party to various international \r\ninstruments, including the United Nations Convention \r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime, the \r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the \r\nTraffic in Women and Children, and the 1957 Abolition \r\nof Forced Labour Convention.\r\nThere is evidence in some cases of a growing nexus \r\nbetween transnational organized criminal groups and \r\nterrorist groups, which is a cause for global concern. \r\nConflict situations provide an ideal opportunity and \r\npropitious environment for such unholy alliances. \r\nTo effectively tackle persistent challenges and \r\nemerging trends, we should continue to be guided by \r\nthe imperative of an integrated and comprehensive \r\napproach buttressed by a long-term political and \r\nfinancial commitment. Coordination and cooperation \r\namong various stakeholders is needed to develop a \r\nsynergistic policy framework for countering this threat.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to convey Pakistan’s \r\nappreciation for the ongoing work of the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime, especially with respect to \r\nassisting Member States in countering the challenge \r\nof trafficking in persons and in providing technical \r\nassistance to countries and personal assistance to the \r\nvictims of trafficking.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Guatemala.\r\nMr. Skinner-Klée (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nGuatemala believes that it is only through dialogue \r\nand the exchange of information and best practices \r\nthat we can articulate a comprehensive, coordinated \r\nand shared response by the States of origin, transit \r\nand destination of smuggled migrants or victims of \r\nhuman trafficking that will guarantee orderly, regular \r\nand secure migratory f lows, ensure full respect for the \r\nhuman rights of migrants and place the person and his \r\nor her rights at the centre of all processes regardless of \r\nimmigration status.\r\nWe believe that the theme of this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, “Focusing on people: Striving for \r\npeace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet”, \r\ngives us a framework to deliberate on the dangers that \r\nirregular migration poses to migrants, who are at risk of \r\nfalling victim to appalling, unlawful acts. Similarly, and \r\nkeeping in mind that the crime of trafficking in persons is \r\ndynamic and multifaceted, it is important to emphasize \r\nthat a forum for dialogue such as the General Assembly \r\nis the appropriate venue for promoting cooperation \r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n26/31 17-30244\r\nand coordination among States, in particular by \r\nstrengthening and implementing instruments created to \r\nimprove the detection, protection, care and repatriation \r\nof victims and support the prevention, prosecution and \r\npunishment of this crime.\r\nGuatemala has made progress in strengthening \r\nits institutional capacities both domestically and in \r\nterms of international legislation, while responding in \r\na differentiated manner to the rights of all migratory \r\ngroups without undermining the rights of the most \r\nvulnerable, such as children and young people, women, \r\npersons with disabilities, the elderly and indigenous \r\npeoples, among other victimized groups. We also bear \r\nin mind that, in addition to ensuring the well-being of \r\nmigrants and their families, it is necessary to safeguard \r\nall of their rights. Against that backdrop, my country \r\ncan highlight the following progress.\r\nIn terms of prevention, Guatemala was the first \r\ncountry in Central America to join the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime’s international campaign, \r\nhaving defined a unified strategy to fight the crime \r\nof trafficking in persons and complying with our \r\ninternational commitments on the subject in terms \r\nof domestic legislation, and placing the issue on \r\nour national agenda in order to generate consensus \r\nand oversee the launch of the appropriate initiatives. \r\nMoreover, as a part of our campaign to raise awareness \r\nand disseminate information, 26 radio broadcasts were \r\nmade in Mayan languages on eight national stations, \r\nin addition to other awareness-raising campaigns \r\nlaunched to alert the population to this scourge.\r\nIn terms of detection, Guatemala has implemented \r\nthe Alba-Keneth Early Alert System, which consists \r\nof a set of specific actions coordinated among public \r\ninstitutions that assist us locating and safeguarding \r\nminors who have been abducted or are missing, thereby \r\nreducing the risk of human trafficking, sexual slavery, \r\nforced labour and even of organ trafficking. Moreover, \r\nit is worth noting that in 2016 the Inter-Institutional \r\nCommittee against Trafficking drafted the \r\nIdentification Guide for Victims of Trafficking in \r\nPersons and Victim Reference Form, which promote \r\nearly detection of potential victims of trafficking and \r\nare to be implemented by different State and civil-\r\nsociety institutions.\r\nIn terms of care and protection, just last year \r\nour agency against sexual violence, exploitation and \r\ntrafficking in persons took measures to strengthen \r\ncomprehensive care for victims, promoting the use and \r\ntaking advantage of the specialized temporary shelter \r\ninfrastructure and strengthening care programmes that \r\ninclude medical, psychological and social assistance \r\nas well as support for rebuilding lives, technical and \r\nvocational training and academic learning.\r\nIn terms of prosecution and punishment, in 2017 \r\nthe State has sentenced 19 perpetrators to terms \r\nranging from two to 28 years of imprisonment for cases \r\ninvolving human trafficking, with such aggravating \r\nfactors as labour exploitation, begging, forced labour \r\nor subjection to bondage.\r\nFinally, we acknowledge with thanks the successful \r\nfacilitation of negotiations by the delegations of \r\nthe State of Qatar and the Kingdom of Belgium that \r\nled to the adoption of the political declaration on \r\nthe implementation of the United Nations Global \r\nPlan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \r\n(resolution 72/1). We reaffirm our commitment and \r\npolitical will to take decisive measures to put an end \r\nto this scourge, which affects mainly children, young \r\npeople and women.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\ndeputy Chair of the delegation of Libya.\r\nMr. Elmajerbi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): This \r\nhigh-level meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nappraisal of the United Nations Global Plan of Action \r\nto Combat Trafficking in Persons is being held at a time \r\nwhen this phenomenon, a grave violation of human \r\nrights and dignity, is on the rise. It is evident that armed \r\nconflicts, unemployment, social exclusion, poverty \r\nand the devastation caused by natural disasters are \r\nkey factors leading to the f light of refugees, migrants, \r\nthe displaced and those who fall into the hands of \r\nmerciless traffickers, whose exploitation of victims is \r\nwithout limit.\r\nAs we appraise the United Nations Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, we \r\nshould not only focus our attention on addressing this \r\nphenomenon and its repercussions but also examine the \r\nconditions contributing to the expansion and increase \r\nof trafficking networks and activities. In that regard, I \r\nwould like to stress the following points.\r\nFirst, the role of diplomacy needs to be enhanced \r\nin order to prevent armed conflicts, keep them from \r\nworsening and put an end to the external forces that \r\nhave fuelled many conflicts and led to the displacement \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 27/31\r\nand suffering of human beings. Such forces create \r\nenvironments conducive to the development of \r\nrapacious criminal networks.\r\nSecondly, we must support the efforts of poor \r\nand developing countries aimed at fulfilling their \r\nobligations within the framework of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, including fighting poverty, hunger \r\nand unemployment and improving service-sector \r\nperformance. That will encourage people not to leave \r\ntheir countries and fall victim to exploitation.\r\nThirdly, we must provide the assistance needed \r\nto build human and institutional capacities that \r\nwill enable national authorities to fight trafficking \r\nnetworks, prosecute perpetrators and overcome \r\nimpunity. Enhanced cooperation is required to \r\neradicate these networks, whose interests are \r\ninterconnected and transcend borders, thanks to \r\nmodern telecommunication technologies.\r\nFourthly, international solidarity must be stepped \r\nup in order to provide fresh resources that respond to the \r\nneed for shelters for refugees and migrants, particularly \r\nin countries unable to fulfil their obligations in this \r\narea. We must focus in particular on the situations of \r\nwomen and children in a manner that respects their \r\nrights and protects them from exploitation.\r\nFifthly, we must establish and implement \r\nprogrammes and activities that raise awareness of the \r\nrisks of the phenomenon of trafficking in persons. We \r\nmust invest resources in the fight against trafficking \r\nin persons and engage eminent personalities in \r\nour campaigns.\r\nSixthly, we must improve data collection, analysis, \r\nstatistics and information exchange with respect to \r\ntrafficking in persons, particularly in relation to natural \r\ndisasters, since disasters contribute to increases in the \r\nnumbers of migrants and refugees. Despite instability \r\nand a lack of resources at the national level, the \r\nLibyan coast guard has managed to rescue thousands \r\nof migrants trying to make their way to Europe. The \r\nrelevant authorities have now identified the trafficking \r\nnetworks and are bringing them to justice.\r\nWe enjoy bilateral cooperation with brotherly and \r\nfriendly countries in addressing this phenomenon. We \r\nlook forward to cooperating with the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime in implementing a number \r\nof programmes and activities related to the fight against \r\ntrafficking in persons.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\ndeputy Chair of the delegation of the United Kingdom.\r\nMr. Allen (United Kingdom): It is clear that \r\ntrafficking in persons is a scourge that unites the \r\nmembership of the United Nations. Since no country \r\nis immune from this awful crime, it is right that every \r\ncountry is united in the shared commitment we made in \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to end \r\nforced labour, modern slavery and human trafficking. \r\nEnsuring that the United Nations Global Plan of Action \r\nto Combat Trafficking in Persons helps deliver on this \r\ncommitment will require us to act across a number \r\nof fronts. I would like to highlight four of them.\r\nFirst, we must bring greater political attention to the \r\nissue of human trafficking. The hidden nature of this \r\ncrime makes it too easy to ignore. As world leaders and \r\ntheir representatives gathered in New York last week, \r\nthe United Kingdom launched a call to action to end \r\nforced labour, modern slavery and human trafficking. \r\nIts statement of political intent explicitly welcomed \r\nand aligned itself very closely with the Global Plan. \r\nApproximately 37 countries have endorsed the call, and \r\nI urge others to do the same.\r\nSecondly, every country should develop and \r\nimplement a national strategy to address each of the \r\nkey elements of prosecution, protection, prevention \r\nand partnerships. The United Kingdom’s approach is \r\nunderpinned by its 2014 modern-slavery strategy. To \r\nshed light on the scale of the problem, every country \r\ncould also consider producing a prevalence estimate \r\nand statistics on trafficking. In 2013, we estimated that \r\nthere were up to 13,000 victims in the United Kingdom.\r\nThirdly, we must ensure that trafficking is stamped \r\nout of our economies. The International Labour \r\nOrganization estimates that forced labour generates \r\n$150 billion in illegal profits each year. We must better \r\nregulate labour policies and work with business to \r\neradicate trafficking from supply chains. The United \r\nKingdom’s Modern Slavery Act requires every business \r\nwith global revenue of over $48 million to report on the \r\nactions it is taking in that regard. Governments must \r\nalso address their own procurement practices.\r\nFourthly, our law-enforcement and criminal-justice \r\nsystems need specialist capabilities. The latest report of \r\nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime made it \r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n28/31 17-30244\r\nclear that the number of global convictions remains too \r\nlow. The United Kingdom introduced a comprehensive \r\nlegal framework in 2015, and we are now seeing \r\nincreasing numbers of convictions for the new offences \r\nit delineated.\r\nTrafficking is a development issue. It is also a \r\nhuman rights issue and a security issue. It needs a \r\ncoherent United Nations response, but, to date, we \r\nhave not seen enough progress made in addressing \r\nthe scale and urgency of the problem. We need United \r\nNations agencies to cooperate effectively and not \r\ncompete with each other over resources and turf. We \r\nurge the Secretary-General to resolve such persistent \r\nchallenges because, whether we describe it as human \r\ntrafficking, modern slavery or forced labour, we must \r\nstand together if the exploitation of human beings is to \r\nend. We have reviewed the Global Plan of Action, so let \r\nus now take action.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\ndeputy Permanent Secretary and Acting Permanent \r\nSecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand.\r\nMr. Srivihok (Thailand): Since the adoption of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons, in 2010, Thailand has made \r\nthe eradication of human trafficking a priority on its \r\nnational agenda. Strengthening the Global Plan of \r\nAction’s “Four Ps” approach, the Thai Government \r\nhas adopted a “4+1 P” framework that comprises \r\nprosecution, protection, prevention, partnership and \r\npolicy. For Thailand, policy is in fact the trunk of the \r\ntree that holds the branches of the other four Ps together.\r\nFirst, in terms of policy, an amendment to the Thai \r\nPrevention and Suppression of Human Trafficking \r\nAct clarifies our definition of exploitation to include \r\npractices similar to slavery, forced labour or services, \r\nseizure of identification documents and debt bondage, \r\nin line with the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime. That ensures that all \r\nvictims of trafficking are protected under Thai law.\r\nSecondly, with regard to prosecution, our zero-\r\ntolerance approach to human trafficking, especially \r\ntraffickers, was evident again recently in the verdict \r\nreached against 62 offenders in the Rohingya matter, \r\nwhere sentences of up to 94 years for Government \r\nofficials were handed down.\r\nThirdly, with respect to protection, Thailand \r\nattaches importance to effective victim-protection \r\nmeasures for all groups, especially vulnerable ones. \r\nWe adhere to a human rights-based approach in the \r\ninterests of victims and provide for child- and gender-\r\nsensitive protection.\r\nFourthly, with regard to prevention, we are working \r\non establishing a national screening mechanism for \r\nundocumented immigrants, victims of trafficking and \r\nrefugees. Once in place, it will effectively screen out \r\nthose who do not need assistance, while screening \r\nin those who truly do need protection. Thailand has \r\nalso signed a labour-cooperation memorandum of \r\nunderstanding with neighbouring countries to facilitate \r\napproximately 403,000 migrant workers from four \r\ndifferent countries be able to work legally in Thailand. \r\nWe have also cooperated with the International Labour \r\nOrganization to promote and implement good-labour-\r\npractices programmes in the fisheries and poultry \r\nsectors. Furthermore, a draft national action plan on \r\nbusiness and human rights, which is in line with the \r\nUnited Nations Guiding Principles on Business and \r\nHuman Rights, is also being developed.\r\nFinally, with regard to partnership, the Government \r\nhas strengthened public-private civil-society \r\npartnerships in various ways. Among many initiatives, \r\na memorandum on cooperation in preventing and \r\nsuppressing trafficking in persons was signed last year \r\nby more than 50 Government agencies and private-sector \r\nand civil-society organizations. Thailand believes that \r\nmore can be done. We have to step up our efforts to \r\nmake sure that trafficking is a high-risk/no-reward \r\nbusiness. We must also cultivate public empathy for the \r\nvictims and give due consideration to the special needs \r\nof all vulnerable groups.\r\nAn improved data-collection and analysis system \r\nis another factor that is essential for providing the right \r\nsolutions in terms of prevention, protection, prosecution \r\nand remedies. In that regard, partner countries, the \r\nUnited Nations and its relevant agencies are in a \r\nposition to contribute, as they have the resources to \r\nhelp all States Members of the United Nations improve \r\ntheir data sets and analysis at the aggregated and \r\ndisaggregated levels.\r\nAs we move forward with the Global Plan following \r\nthe adoption of the political declaration, we must \r\nstrengthen cooperation with all stakeholders, including \r\nthe private sector. Their roles and contributions are \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 29/31\r\ninvaluable and must be integrated into our efforts at \r\nall levels. The Bali Process Government and Business \r\nForum, launched in Perth, Australia, last month, is \r\na promising initiative that should be fostered and \r\ndeveloped alongside domestic efforts in the same vein.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Argentina.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Due to the allocated time limitations, \r\nthis is a summarized version of the Argentine \r\nRepublic’s statement, which is available in its entirety \r\nvia PaperSmart.\r\nArgentina believes that the fight against trafficking \r\nin persons and forced labour should be holistic. It should \r\ninclude multiple actors working at different levels \r\nand take place within the framework of the defence \r\nand promotion of human rights. This perspective is \r\nreflected in Argentina’s policies on combating the \r\ncrime of trafficking and on providing assistance to \r\nvictims, with the understanding that preventing this \r\ncrime is impossible without guaranteeing an inclusive \r\nsociety. The Government of President Macri has placed \r\nspecial emphasis on promoting a gender perspective, \r\nin line with Sustainable Development Goal 5, from \r\na multisectoral, cross-cutting and federal approach. \r\nGender equality is one of the fundamental objectives \r\nof our Government, and the overall empowerment of \r\nwomen will contribute to the prevention of trafficking.\r\nFor Argentina, the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction against Trafficking in Persons is a fundamental \r\ntool for the implementation of public policies. That \r\nis why we welcomed the adoption of the political \r\ndeclaration on the implementation of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action (resolution 72/1) at the beginning \r\nof this high-level meeting (see A/72/PV.24).\r\nArgentina remains committed to combating human \r\ntrafficking, which is the most extreme form of violence, \r\nby engaging at the multilateral level and promoting \r\nnational policies designed to eliminate the crime in the \r\ncountry. From a human rights perspective, Argentina \r\nprotects the privacy and identity of victims of human \r\ntrafficking and seeks to take measures to ensure their \r\nphysical, psychological and social recovery. Argentina \r\nworks to provide victims with adequate housing, \r\ncounselling and information in various languages, as \r\nwell as medical, psychological and material assistance. \r\nIt also endeavours to provide victims — be they foreign \r\nor domestic — with employment and educational \r\nopportunities as well as adequate and accessible training.\r\nThe State is striving to encourage the reintegration \r\nof victims of trafficking and labour exploitation into \r\nsociety, promote dignified work and, working in tandem \r\nwith the private sector, establish joint mechanisms \r\nso as to avoid the recurrence of such crimes. The \r\nobjective is to avoid violating victims’ rights and their \r\nrevictimization at all stages of the process. Argentina \r\nensures that foreign victims are given the option of \r\nremaining in the country, filing for refugee status \r\nor returning to their country of origin. In addition, \r\nunder Argentine anti-trafficking law, victims will not \r\nbe punished.\r\nWe would also like to mention Argentina’s work \r\nin the context of the Southern Common Market \r\n(MERCOSUR), which has approached the matter by \r\nadopting a regional guide on the early detection of \r\ntransborder human trafficking and by sponsoring a \r\ncampaign entitled “MERCOSUR free of trafficking”, \r\nwhich is aimed at raising awareness of the crime.\r\nThe Argentine Republic considers trafficking \r\nin persons to be a complex and very serious form of \r\nexploitation. We hope we can continue to work together \r\nwith the rest of the international community in order to \r\nend an abuse that violates human rights and for which \r\nthere must always be zero tolerance.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of delegation of the Republic of Colombia.\r\nMs. Mejía Vélez (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nwelcome the renewed support for the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \r\nand the fight against this terrible scourge, which affects \r\nalmost all of us, in particular women and girls, as was \r\nillustrated by the heart-wrenching testimony that we \r\nheard yesterday (see A/72/PV.24). We welcome the \r\npolitical declaration on the implementation of the \r\nGlobal Plan of Action (resolution 72/1), which, together \r\nwith the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand across the three unambiguous pillars set forth in \r\nSustainable Development Goals and targets 5.2, 8.7 and \r\n16.2, reaffirms our political commitment and provides \r\nus with a road map that my Government has embraced \r\nwith a view to preventing and combating trafficking in \r\npersons and protecting and assisting its victims.\r\nColombia considers trafficking in persons to be \r\nan offshoot of transnational organized crime whereby \r\nA/72/PV.25 28/09/2017\r\n30/31 17-30244\r\nnumerous countries are transformed at one and the \r\nsame time into points of origin, transit and destination \r\nof victims, thereby making the prevention, investigation \r\nand prosecution of trafficking activities conducted by \r\ncriminal organizations and their links all the more \r\ndifficult. Trafficking in persons is an international \r\nphenomenon with global consequences, which leads to \r\nserious human rights violations.\r\nUnfortunately, my country is not exempt from this \r\nphenomenon. Every year, the national Government \r\nidentifies and assists many victims of the crime in \r\nits very various forms, including sexual exploitation, \r\nforced labour and begging on behalf of others. In the \r\nstruggle against the phenomenon and in accordance with \r\nthe provisions of the Global Plan of Action, Colombia is \r\nundertaking activities in three fundamental areas that I \r\nwould like to mention.\r\nFirst, in terms of prevention, we have made \r\nprogress in educating children and adolescents on \r\nhow to exercise their human, sexual and reproductive \r\nrights so that they can make responsible, informed and \r\nautonomous decisions concerning their bodies and their \r\nown sexuality. Through this approach, we are dealing a \r\nforceful blow to human trafficking.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the investigation and \r\nprosecution component, my country is strengthening \r\nits judicial branch through specialized training in the \r\ncrime of human trafficking, while seeking to ensure that \r\nthe competent authorities have a clear understanding of \r\nthe phenomenon.\r\nThirdly, assisting victims is one of our main \r\nobjectives. We are striving to strengthen the processes \r\nwhereby assistance is delivered to children and \r\nadolescents who are directly or indirectly victimized \r\nby the crime.\r\nThose actions confirm the national Government \r\nof Colombia’s commitment and resolve in combating \r\nhuman trafficking, as well as the progress it has made. \r\nThe complex reality of the issue, however, requires \r\nthe involvement of the international community as a \r\nwhole, which is why we are also working closely with \r\nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and \r\nthe International Organization for Migration. Indeed, \r\neradicating the human-trafficking phenomenon once and \r\nfor all requires our joint efforts and determined action.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Kenya.\r\nMs. Mwangi (Kenya): We thank the President \r\nfor convening this high-level meeting to review the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons and our \r\ncollective efforts to combat human trafficking.\r\nHuman trafficking is a global phenomenon that \r\naffects almost every country in the world, be it a \r\ncountry of origin, transit or destination for its victims. \r\nPersons from sub-Saharan Africa and from countries \r\nin conflict are especially vulnerable to being trafficked \r\nas a result of the so-called push factors for human \r\ntrafficking, which include conflicts, poverty, the lack \r\nof economic opportunities, unemployment and low \r\nrates of education, as well as inequalities between and \r\namong countries. We may also need to consider whether \r\nthere is a causal link between racism, bigotry, prejudice \r\nand human trafficking so as to craft effective legal and \r\npolicy responses and address the unique vulnerabilities \r\nof victims.\r\nKenya is a signatory of the Protocol to Prevent, \r\nSuppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially \r\nWomen and Children, supplementing the United \r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime, to which it acceded in 2005. The Protocol was \r\nincorporated into Kenya’s domestic legislation in 2010 \r\nthrough the promulgation of the Counter-trafficking \r\nin Persons Act. In order to implement that legislation, \r\nan advisory committee was established to advise \r\nthe Government on inter-agency activities aimed at \r\ncombating trafficking in persons. The Committee was \r\nalso given the mandate to enhance the implementation \r\nof preventive, protective and rehabilitative programmes \r\nfor trafficked persons, among its other functions. The \r\ncommittee is also training key actors in the justice sector, \r\nincluding the police, judicial officers, investigators and \r\nprosecutors, on effective ways to combat trafficking \r\nusing a multisectoral approach.\r\nKenya also adopted the Victims Protection Act with \r\na view to protecting vulnerable victims, such as those \r\nwho have been rescued from traffickers. The Act offers \r\nprotection to any person in Kenya identified as a victim \r\nof trafficking and establishes a victims assistance fund. \r\nWe have also developed a national plan of action to \r\ncombat human trafficking and promote cooperation \r\namong various stakeholders from all sectors. The plan \r\nof action lays the groundwork for closer regional and \r\ninternational cooperation and offers a coherent road \r\nmap for addressing the problems of human trafficking \r\nin Kenya.\r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.25\r\n17-30244 31/31\r\nIn 2016, the Government developed the guidelines \r\nfor a national referral mechanism to assist victims of \r\nhuman trafficking. The mechanism is in essence a \r\nsystem geared towards identification, referrals, holistic \r\nsupport and assistance for the victims of trafficking.\r\nFor the fiscal year 2017-2018, the counter-trafficking \r\nin persons secretariat received $600,000 and an \r\nadditional $200,000 in order to fund the establishment \r\nof a shelter for victims. The Government has organized \r\npublic-awareness campaigns on trafficking in persons, \r\nsuch as the one Kenya sponsored on 30 July 2017, World \r\nDay Against Trafficking in Persons.\r\nIn 2014, the Government revoked the licenses of \r\nmore than 900 agencies that had been recruiting workers \r\nfor jobs in the Middle East and the Gulf region. It \r\ncontinues to vet recruitment agencies by requiring them \r\nto reapply for accreditation on an annual basis. We have \r\nalso signed bilateral agreements with several countries \r\nto help ease the resettlement of Kenyan migrant workers \r\nand to address cases of abuse when they are reported. \r\nWe believe that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, with its Sustainable Development Goals \r\non trafficking in persons, provides the foundation for \r\nthe actions that need to be taken to prevent and combat \r\ntrafficking in persons and migrant smuggling.\r\nThe Government has also initiated various \r\nempowerment strategies with a view to improving the \r\nlivelihoods of Kenyans by setting up a number of funds \r\nfor the benefit of women, young people, orphans and \r\npersons with disabilities. It has also supported projects \r\ndesigned to address unemployment. Kenya calls for \r\nenhanced international cooperation, including in terms \r\nof capacity-building and technical assistance, in order \r\nto prevent and combat trafficking in persons.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
