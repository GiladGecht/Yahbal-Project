"United Nations A/72/PV.26\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n26th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 28 September 2017, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Saikal \r\n(Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 107 (continued)\r\nCrime prevention and criminal justice\r\nHigh-level meeting of the General Assembly on \r\nthe appraisal of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons\r\nThe Acting President: Before we proceed, I would \r\nlike to remind all speakers to limit their statements to \r\nthree minutes when speaking in their national capacity, \r\nas stipulated in resolution 71/287. As members will \r\nrecall, in its resolution 71/323, of 8 September 2017, the \r\nGeneral Assembly called for strict adherence by each \r\nspeaker to the time limits in the Assembly, in particular \r\nduring high-level meetings. This will enable maximum \r\nparticipation within the limited time available for \r\nthis meeting. Participants with longer statements are \r\nencouraged to read a shorter version of their text and \r\nto submit their full statements to the Secretariat for \r\nposting on the PaperSmart portal.\r\nAlso in accordance with resolution 71/323, the “all \r\nprotocol observed” principle, whereby participants are \r\nencouraged, in the interest of time, to refrain from the \r\nlisting of standard protocol expressions during their \r\nstatements, is recommended. In the light of that given \r\ntime frame, I would like to appeal to speakers to deliver \r\ntheir statements at a normal speed so that interpretation \r\nmay be provided properly. To assist speakers in \r\nmanaging their time, a light system has been installed \r\nat the speaker’s rostrum. May I appeal to all speakers \r\nfor their cooperation in observing the time limit of their \r\nstatements, so that all those inscribed will be heard in \r\na timely manner.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Canada.\r\nMr. Holmes (Canada): Canada applauds the \r\nongoing efforts of the General Assembly and Member \r\nStates to address the complex global issue of trafficking \r\nin persons, including through the United Nations Global \r\nPlan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons. We \r\nare committed to this fight both at home and abroad. \r\nCanada was among the first countries to ratify the \r\nProtocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking \r\nin Persons, Especially Women and Children.\r\nSince its ratification, Canada has made significant \r\nprogress in its fight against trafficking in persons. \r\nStrong criminal laws are in place to prohibit all forms \r\nof trafficking in persons, which is punishable by \r\nsevere penalties up to life imprisonment, and federal \r\nlegislation enshrines rights for all. Canada launched \r\nits national action plan to combat human trafficking, \r\nwhich consolidated efforts to combat the crime into a \r\ncomprehensive approach using prevention, protection, \r\nprosecution and partnerships.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada is currently finalizing an extensive \r\nevaluation of its national plan. The results of that \r\nstudy will inform us of the best way forward on this \r\nimportant issue.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n17-30252 (E)\r\n*1730252*\r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n2/32 17-30252\r\nIn the area of prevention, we have continued to \r\ndevelop information and outreach programmes that \r\ntarget the most at-risk populations, including aboriginal \r\nwomen and girls, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and \r\nqueer persons, youth and/or runaways, foreign workers \r\nand those who are economically disadvantaged.\r\nIn terms of prosecutions, we have made significant \r\nprogress in addressing our criminal-justice responses \r\nto trafficking crimes through targeted training and \r\nvarious reforms. Those actions have resulted in more \r\nconvictions and a better understanding of the issue \r\namong criminal-justice practitioners.\r\nIn terms of victim protection, the Government of \r\nCanada continues to work with its domestic partners, \r\nincluding provincial and territorial Governments and \r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI would like to highlight one initiative that I believe \r\nwill be of interest to States parties, which was launched \r\nin 2016. Project Protect is a joint initiative between the \r\nGovernment of Canada and the private sector, allowing \r\nCanadian financial institutions to report transactions \r\nthat are suspected to involve money-laundering related \r\nto trafficking in persons for sexual exploitation. In \r\n2016, compared to the same four-month period in \r\n2015, the Project produced a 400 per cent increase in \r\nfinancial-intelligence disclosures to law enforcement \r\nlinking money-laundering to trafficking in persons.\r\nIn addition to our domestic efforts, Canada \r\ncontinues to work with the United Nations Office on \r\nDrugs and Crime, the International Organization for \r\nMigration and INTERPOL, among other international \r\npartners, to provide technical assistance and capacity-\r\nbuilding, enabling countries to successfully address \r\ntrafficking in persons.\r\nAcknowledging that trafficking is a crime that \r\ndisproportionately affects women and girls, our new \r\nfeminist international assistance policy will address \r\nthe unacceptably high rates of sexual and gender-based \r\nviolence experienced by women and girls, including \r\nthose in situations of human trafficking. In addition, \r\nCanada is making strides to eradicate trafficking in \r\npersons from the production of goods and provision of \r\nservices. As part of this, we are expanding our code of \r\nconduct for procurement to ensure that the Government \r\nof Canada’s supply chains are free of trafficking \r\nin persons.\r\nThe role of civil-society organizations in combating \r\ntrafficking in persons cannot be understated. These \r\norganizations, which are often the first point of contact \r\nfor victims, carry out important advocacy on their \r\nbehalf and provide important knowledge, skills and \r\nexpertise, particularly in the realm of victim care, \r\nsupport and rehabilitation.\r\nIn conclusion, Canada urges the widest possible \r\nratification and implementation of the United Nations \r\nProtocol, as it is the key international instrument \r\nguiding countries in the fight against trafficking in \r\npersons. Canada is committed to collaborating with the \r\nUnited Nations and all countries in order to prevent this \r\ncrime, bring those who commit it to justice and help \r\nsurvivors go on to lead healthy and productive lives.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Azerbaijan.\r\nMr. Heydarov (Azerbaijan) (spoke in Russian): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to express my warm greetings \r\nand my gratitude to the Assembly for the opportunity \r\nto discuss this issue.\r\nAs a pioneer and one of the region’s most active and \r\nprogressive countries in preventing human trafficking, \r\nas long ago as 2003 the Republic of Azerbaijan ratified \r\nthe United Nations Convention against Transnational \r\nOrganized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress \r\nand Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women \r\nand Children. The three national action plans for 2004, \r\n2009 and 2014, formulated and approved by our Head \r\nof State, have played a major role in the complex and \r\nsystematic struggle against human trafficking in our \r\ncountry. At the Government level, we have adopted a \r\nnational referral mechanism and rules for identifying \r\nand rehabilitating victims of human trafficking, placing \r\nthem in specialized institutions and repatriating them \r\nto their own countries.\r\nIn order to coordinate the Government agencies, \r\ncivil-society organizations and foreign partners working \r\nto combat human trafficking, we have established \r\na national coordination agency and an inter-agency \r\ncommission. With the goal of implementing our national \r\naction plan, through our council for State support to \r\nnon-governmental organizations, under the direction of \r\nthe President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, we have \r\nfunded more than 50 projects.\r\nWithin the Ministry of the Interior, we have set \r\nup a special police unit to combat human trafficking, \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 3/32\r\nas well as a Government assistance centre, fund and \r\nhot line for victims. During this period, Interior \r\nMinistry agencies have identified more than 19,000 \r\ncases of human trafficking and forced labour, and \r\nhave prosecuted more than 200 criminal groups and \r\nbrought to justice 495 criminals. Overall, 774 victims \r\nof such crimes have been successfully reintegrated into \r\nsociety. All the victims have been granted the right to \r\ncompensation, recovery time and a period of reflection, \r\nas well as permission to obtain residence permits and \r\nassurance of non-punishment. They have all also been \r\nprovided with legal, medical, psychological and other \r\nforms of assistance and returned to normal life.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my confidence \r\nthat every country participating in today’s meeting \r\nwill continue to contribute to our fight against human \r\ntrafficking, and I wish them every success.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\ndeputy Chair of the delegation of Latvia.\r\nMs. Vilde (Latvia): Human trafficking affects \r\nmillions of people every year on every continent. This \r\nshameful crime is a highly organized and lucrative \r\nbusiness. It is also a gross violation of human rights \r\nthat mostly affects women and children. Latvia is \r\nfirmly committed to combating this heinous crime and \r\nhas developed a strong legal framework for addressing \r\ntrafficking in human beings through severe punishment \r\nbased on the relevant United Nations, European Union \r\nand Council of Europe legal instruments. At the same \r\ntime, we have enacted legislation on the non-punishment \r\nof victims of trafficking. Latvia also recently signed \r\nthe Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking \r\nin Human Organs, another area of great concern.\r\nLatvia’s national strategy for the prevention of \r\ntrafficking in human beings in the period from 2014 to \r\n2020 is based on the four Ps — prevention, protection, \r\nprosecution and partnership — and addresses current \r\nrisks and trends. As a country of origin of victims of \r\nhuman trafficking, especially young women, Latvia \r\npays particular attention to combating trafficking \r\nfor the purpose of sexual exploitation, as well as \r\nlabour exploitation and fictitious marriage. Our law-\r\nenforcement agencies work in close cooperation with \r\nnon-governmental organizations in identifying and \r\nassisting Latvian and third-country nationals subjected \r\nto trafficking for the purpose of exploitation.\r\nTransnational inter-institutional cooperation \r\ninvolving public and private partnership is a core \r\npillar for achieving results in this fight. Raising public \r\nawareness and understanding about the risks that lead \r\nto human trafficking, in cooperation with media and \r\ninformation communication technology companies, \r\nmust be a priority.\r\nSo-called sham marriages between Latvian citizens \r\nand third-country nationals, arranged in other countries \r\nwith the sole purpose of obtaining a European Union \r\nresidence permit, have been a serious concern for the \r\nLatvian Government in the past few years. Latvia \r\nis a part of a regional awareness-raising campaign, \r\ninvolving several European countries, on preventing \r\nhuman trafficking and sham marriages. The project \r\nprovides regional training for multidisciplinary groups \r\nof experts and practitioners, as well as informative \r\nactivities for raising awareness on the issue. As a \r\nresult, the number of Latvian citizens in such fictitious \r\nmarriages abroad has fallen substantially.\r\nAn individual- and victim-centred approach that \r\ntakes victims’ needs and best interests into consideration \r\nmust be our priority. Latvia provides State-funded \r\nassistance to victims of trafficking, including social \r\nand psychological rehabilitation services, safe shelter, \r\nlegal aid, compensation, medical treatment, special \r\nprotection and access to education and the labour \r\nmarket. Non-governmental organizations are involved \r\nin all stages, from reporting to identification and \r\nvictim assistance. Close cooperation between law \r\nenforcement, the judiciary and victim service providers \r\nshould be further facilitated. It is also important to \r\nconsider how to improve victims’ reintegration after \r\nthey have received services.\r\nTrends in human trafficking are constantly changing \r\nand affect every country. Given the transnational nature \r\nof this crime, national efforts are not enough. Based \r\non our own experience, it is important for countries \r\nof origin to work closely with those of transit and \r\ndestination to fight this crime together.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Guinea.\r\nMr. Komara (Guinea) (spoke in French): It is a great \r\nhonour for me to speak on behalf of the Government of \r\nGuinea on the occasion of this high-level meeting to \r\nconsider the United Nations Global Plan of Action to \r\nCombat Trafficking in Persons.\r\nMy delegation strongly welcomes the Assembly’s \r\nadoption yesterday of the political declaration on the \r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n4/32 17-30252\r\nimplementation of the Global Plan of Action (resolution \r\n72/1), which should help to speed up our fulfilment of \r\nour commitments to combating trafficking in persons. \r\nWe thank partners for their continuing support to the \r\nmajor legislative reform efforts aimed at creating a \r\nlegal framework for the protection of human rights.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea has expressed its \r\nwillingness to combat this scourge by ratifying the \r\nmain international, regional and subregional legal \r\ninstruments for the protection of human rights, in \r\nparticular the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime and its additional \r\nProtocols, as well as the multilateral agreement of \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States \r\non combating human trafficking. Strengthening \r\ninternational cooperation in preventing and eliminating \r\ntrafficking should be one of our priorities in eradicating \r\nthis scourge.\r\nGuinea is a country of origin, transit and \r\ndestination for victims of human trafficking, a situation \r\nthat has encouraged my Government to take a number \r\nof measures. We have strengthened our institutional \r\nframework for combating human trafficking by \r\nestablishing a national committee to combat human \r\ntrafficking and related practices, and developing an \r\nemergency plan of action with a budget that includes \r\ntraining judges and security forces and a nationwide \r\nawareness-raising campaign. The law on organization \r\nof the judiciary and the new criminal code, which \r\ntransfers criminal jurisdiction from courts of appeal \r\nto trial courts, is now in force. We have strengthened \r\nour cooperation with neighbouring countries, such as \r\nMali, as part of the fight against trafficking in children. \r\nIn November, six countries of the subregion will sign \r\na cooperation agreement. We also have a document \r\nevaluating our national mechanisms for the care of \r\nvictims of human trafficking.\r\nI cannot conclude my statement without first \r\nasking our technical and financial partners to continue \r\nsupporting my country in its efforts to combat the \r\nexploitation of human beings in all its forms.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Finland.\r\nMr. Sauer (Finland): Finland considers trafficking \r\nin persons a grave human rights violation and a serious \r\nglobal problem. It undermines the principles of a \r\ndemocratic society, the rule of law and respect for \r\nhuman dignity. In order to tackle human trafficking, and \r\nall the forms of criminal networks and organized crime \r\nconnected to it, it is crucial that we work together at the \r\ninternational, regional and local levels with a variety \r\nof stakeholders, whether authorities, non-governmental \r\norganizations or other actors. We consider today’s \r\nmeeting to be essential for highlighting the continuing \r\nneed for wide cooperation and commitment in combating \r\ntrafficking in persons. International obligations and \r\nbest practices make it clear that all counter-trafficking \r\nefforts require a holistic approach.\r\nFinland has ratified the international agreements \r\nrelated to trafficking in human beings and translated \r\nthem into national legislation, and has been taking part \r\nin monitoring their implementation within, for example, \r\nthe United Nations and Council of Europe frameworks. \r\nIn the past few years we have worked to improve \r\nour national system’s ability to prevent trafficking, \r\nprotect victims and prosecute perpetrators. We have \r\nappointed a national anti-trafficking coordinator in \r\norder to improve our inter-agency cooperation. The \r\nnational rapporteur on trafficking, who maintains an \r\nindependent role and reports directly to Parliament, \r\nremains an important part of the system.\r\nThere is still a lot we can do to better prevent, \r\nprotect and prosecute. Identifying the victims is a \r\npriority but continues to be a challenge in Finland, \r\nespecially where victims of sexual exploitation are \r\nconcerned. The authorities often find it hard to reach \r\nvictims living on the margins of society, sometimes \r\nas undocumented migrants. Civil society has a central \r\nrole to play in finding and assisting them. Developing \r\nfunctional partnerships is therefore a key element of \r\nour anti-trafficking strategy. Most of the trafficking \r\nvictims we find are victims of sexual exploitation; \r\nabout half of all victims detected are women and a \r\nfifth are girls. As a human rights violation, trafficking \r\nrequires a human-rights-based approach, and special \r\nattention should be paid to the gendered nature of such \r\ncrimes. The specific needs of women, girls and victims \r\nof sexual exploitation and abuse must be taken into \r\naccount in developing assistance systems.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Liechtenstein.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): Human \r\ntrafficking and modern slavery are among the biggest \r\nhuman rights scandals of our time. They are an affront \r\nto the public conscience, constitute grave violations \r\nof human rights law and are a serious obstacle to \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 5/32\r\nsustainable development. They directly affect 46 million \r\npeople worldwide.\r\nWith the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and \r\nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \r\nChildren, we have agreed on an international definition \r\nof the crime of trafficking in persons. The Protocol \r\nprovides a legal framework to effectively prevent and \r\ncombat all forms of trafficking in persons, including \r\nthe exploitation of others’ prostitution or other forms of \r\nsexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery \r\nor practices similar to slavery, servitude and the \r\nremoval of organs. While the Trafficking in Persons \r\nProtocol has been widely ratified, it still lacks the \r\nuniversal acceptance that would enable it to exert its \r\nfull potential. We hope that this goal will be achieved \r\nsoon. Liechtenstein has been a strong advocate for \r\nits universality, in the context, among others, of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review, under the auspices of the \r\nHuman Rights Council.\r\nLaw enforcement and criminal justice are key \r\ndimensions in our common fight against human \r\ntrafficking and modern slavery. A comprehensive \r\nresponse on the part of the international community, \r\nincluding to new and emerging challenges, also \r\nrequires strong cooperation in other aspects. We \r\ntherefore welcome the fact that the 2030 Agenda on \r\nSustainable Development addresses the issue in three \r\nof its 17 Sustainable Development Goals — Goals 5, \r\non gender equality, 8, on decent work and economic \r\ngrowth, and 16, on peaceful and inclusive societies. \r\nWe have established a collective understanding that \r\ncombating modern slavery and the trafficking of \r\npersons is intimately linked to sustainable development \r\nefforts, peace and security, and human rights. We had \r\nhoped for a more ambitious political declaration on the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons (resolution \r\n72/1) for this high-level meeting, one that would \r\nreflect the need for comprehensive policy responses. \r\nIn that regard, we consider the Declaration rather a \r\nmissed opportunity.\r\nHuman trafficking and modern slavery are \r\ncomplex phenomena. Nationally, we in Liechtenstein \r\nhave identified two areas for focusing our engagement. \r\nFirst, we aim to strengthen accountability, including \r\nthrough the involvement of international criminal \r\njustice mechanisms. There is a customary norm of \r\ninternational law against slavery, and enslavement is \r\nlisted as a crime against humanity in the Rome Statute \r\nof the International Criminal Court. Secondly, we have \r\nused the expertise and knowledge of our financial \r\ncentre, particularly our financial intelligence unit, to \r\nadapt existing tools to fight money-laundering and \r\nthe financing of terrorism, which can also help us in \r\nthe fight against human trafficking by following the \r\nmoney. Those efforts are particularly relevant, because \r\nmodern slavery is one of the big illegal business models \r\nof our day, generating more than $150 billion annually.\r\nThe United Nations can be an ideal platform for \r\nforming the necessary partnerships among the various \r\nUnited Nations bodies, as long as awareness of the \r\ncommon cause, a cooperative spirit and a commitment \r\nto a complementarity of effort prevail. That will enable \r\nour Organization to attract the support of Government \r\nand private-sector and civil-society entities that are \r\ncommitted and ready to invest in our shared fight.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\ndeputy Chair of the delegation of Japan.\r\nMr. Hoshino (Japan): On behalf of the Government \r\nof Japan, I would like to welcome the convening of this \r\nhigh-level meeting, which provides a great opportunity \r\nfor Member States, United Nations entities and civil \r\nsociety to evaluate the implementation of the United \r\nNations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons.\r\nTrafficking in persons is a serious crime as well as \r\na grave violation of human dignity and integrity. The \r\nnexus between it and terrorism has recently become a \r\nmatter of deep concern, and terrorist groups are using \r\ntrafficking in persons as a tactic of fund-raising and \r\nrecruitment, as the Security Council highlighted last \r\nyear with its adoption of resolution 2331 (2016). That \r\nnew development is helping to prolong and exacerbate \r\nconflict and instability. Member States have the shared \r\nresponsibility to eliminate this crime. Japan welcomes \r\nthe fact that Member States at this high-level meeting \r\nare demonstrating our strong political will to take \r\ndecisive and concerted action to end this heinous crime \r\nwherever it may occur.\r\nThe fight against trafficking in persons is one of \r\nthe most important policy areas for the Government \r\nof Japan. The Government takes comprehensive and \r\nholistic measures with effective coordination among \r\nrelevant agencies based on its 2014 Action Plan \r\nto Combat Trafficking in Persons. As required by \r\nthat Action Plan, the Government follows up on its \r\nimplementation by issuing an annual report with a \r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n6/32 17-30252\r\nview to broadly providing information on the measures \r\ntaken by the Government and to raise awareness \r\namong citizens.\r\nIn addition to our efforts at the national level, \r\nbuilding strong partnerships with various international \r\nand regional stakeholders is also of interest to us. In that \r\nregard, Japan has been holding an annual Japan-United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) strategic \r\npolicy dialogue since 2013. Enhancing law-enforcement \r\ncapacity around the world to combat trafficking in \r\npersons is one of the priorities of that cooperation, and \r\nwe are delighted to see experts from Japan playing a \r\ncentral role in implementing various anti-trafficking \r\nprojects developed by UNODC, particularly in South-\r\nEast Asian countries.\r\nJapan has also been providing technical assistance \r\nfor prevention, victim protection and rehabilitation \r\nmeasures through the Japan International Cooperation \r\nAgency and in collaboration with the International \r\nOrganization for Migration. We also welcome the fact \r\nthat the Japan-Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\nIntegration Fund has been utilized to implement \r\nprojects to address this crime.\r\nI take this opportunity to note that Japan became \r\na party to the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime and its supplementary \r\nProtocol on Trafficking in Persons on 11 July 2017. \r\nSince then, in September, Japan participated in the \r\nWorking Group on Trafficking in Persons as a State \r\nparty to the Protocol. As these international instruments \r\nplay a central role in the fight against trafficking in \r\npersons, Japan is committed to engaging fully in the \r\nprocess of establishing a mechanism for the review of \r\nthe implementation of these instruments and to further \r\nstrengthening cooperation with other countries.\r\nI would like to conclude my statement by expressing \r\nour commitment to continuing to take practical steps to \r\naddress this issue in line with the Global Plan of Action \r\nand relevant Sustainable Development Goals, in close \r\ncooperation with other Member States, the relevant \r\nUnited Nations organizations and civil society.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of Cabo Verde.\r\nMr. Fialho Rocha (Cabo Verde): Trafficking in \r\npersons is a matter of concern for the Government of \r\nCabo Verde in many respects. It represents a real threat \r\nto human dignity and to human development. It is a \r\ndenial of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It \r\nis a source of wounds and suffering for its victims. It is \r\nalso a crime committed by perpetrators who deserve to \r\nbe treated with no mercy by national and international \r\nlaw enforcement. Finally, it requires a global and \r\npolitical response.\r\nMoreover, it is our view that preventing and \r\ncombating trafficking in persons is an endeavour that \r\nmust bring together all related Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, namely, those with respect to poverty eradication, \r\nquality education, decent work, reduced inequalities, \r\nand promotion of peaceful, just and inclusive societies, \r\ncombined, in addition, with measures for safe and regular \r\nmigration and safe tourism free of sexual exploitation. \r\nThe strides made to address these phenomena should be \r\ngender-sensitive and responsive, with policies aimed at \r\ncombating all forms of discrimination, forced labour, \r\nsexual exploitation and abuse, and all forms of violence \r\nagainst women and girls.\r\nTo combat trafficking in persons, Cabo Verde \r\nfirst endorsed the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime and related Protocols. \r\nSecondly, Cabo Verde criminalized trafficking \r\nthrough its domestic legislation. Thirdly, my country \r\nimplemented institutional and operational responses.\r\nNevertheless, with its limited resources and with \r\na large maritime area under its jurisdiction to control, \r\nCabo Verde underlines the need to expand the means \r\nallocated to implement policies and programmes \r\nthat might end this scourge. Appropriate and timely \r\ninternational cooperation on capacity-building, technical \r\nassistance and support for operational programmes at \r\nthe country level can make a difference by providing \r\nbold responses against trafficking in persons and other \r\nrelated transnational organized crimes.\r\nThat is precisely the spirit of the political declaration \r\nadopted at this high-level meeting of the General \r\nAssembly in its opening segment (resolution 72/1). \r\nWe reaffirm that global financing to prevent and fight \r\nhuman trafficking needs to be increased and improved. \r\nThat is also how we can pave the way for the effective \r\nimplementation of the 2010 United Nations Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.\r\nLet me conclude by underlining the fact that, as \r\nwe move further into the twenty-first century, human \r\nbeings are still capable of trafficking people, of modern \r\nforms of slavery and other related crimes. We have said \r\nbefore and repeat that these are crimes against humanity \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 7/32\r\nand that they remain unpunished. It is therefore in our \r\nhands to leave no one behind in the trafficking trap, \r\nif we can join our wills, our hands and our means in \r\na global strategy for this purpose. The strategy exists \r\nalready through the Global Plan of Action. It is up to all \r\nof us to implement it successfully.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of Chile.\r\nMr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy country aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Panama on behalf of the Human \r\nSecurity Network (see A/72/PV.24).\r\nAs a country of origin, destination and transit in \r\nthe trafficking in persons, Chile has not escaped the \r\nsad reality of human trafficking. That is why, following \r\nthe international guidelines set forth in the United \r\nNations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons, my country has developed a complete \r\nand comprehensive public State policy that includes \r\nthe axes of prevention, persecution and assistance for \r\nvictims. Two national anti-trafficking plans, adopted in \r\n2011 and 2015, and the training of nearly 2,000 public \r\nofficials in detection and prosecution demonstrate the \r\npermanence of our policy and the determination to \r\ncontinue to promote it.\r\nIn the second plan, for the period from 2015 to \r\n2018, we have made progress in fundamental ways to \r\naddress this multidimensional phenomenon, such as \r\nbroad recognition of the rights of victims and of the \r\nneed to improve and deepen coordination in terms of \r\nprevention and prosecution, and the incorporation of \r\nindicators for monitoring programme implementation. \r\nThat is relevant if we consider that in Chile there \r\nhave not been not a great many formalized cases of \r\ntrafficking in persons since its classification as a crime \r\nin 2011. At the national level, only 29 cases and 206 \r\nvictims were registered between 2011 and 2016.\r\nSince the classification of the crime of smuggling \r\nmigrants, that joint work has produced concrete results. \r\nMmanuals for prevention, detection and persecution \r\nhave been produced, and there are specific actions to \r\nprovide care and reparation for victims.\r\nIn the international sphere, Chile has worked \r\nto promote cooperation with countries of the Latin \r\nAmerican and Carribean region, as well as at the \r\nsubregional level with the Southern Common Market \r\nand the Union of South American Nations, and at the \r\nhemispheric level with the Organization of American \r\nStates. Bilaterally, we work with Argentina, Colombia, \r\nthe United States and Peru. Today, we are moving \r\nforward in planning cooperation with the Dominican \r\nRepublic and Bolivia.\r\nWe also recognize the importance of concerted \r\nglobal action in the framework of the Working Group \r\non Trafficking in Persons, in Vienna, the Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, and \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime. \r\nWe aspire to deepen and integrate those actions and \r\nto develop spaces of coordination and dialogue with \r\nthese institutions.\r\nChile favours vigorous progress along those lines. \r\nThus we systematically support the achievement of \r\na transparent, inclusive, non-invasive and impartial \r\ninternational instrument. Along with measuring the \r\nlevel of compliance of States, it would also indicate \r\nthe extent to which that compliance has led to progress \r\ntowards the ultimate objectives of the Convention \r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of Costa Rica.\r\nMr. Mendoza-García (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Costa Rica endorses the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Panama on behalf of the Human \r\nSecurity Network (see A/72/PV.24), and we highlight \r\nthe importance of the focus on placing the individual \r\nat the centre in prevention, protection and fighting \r\ntrafficking in persons.\r\nChildren still make up one third of victims at the \r\nglobal level, and women and girls 71 per cent, according \r\nto the latest report of the United Nations Office on \r\nDrugs and Crime. For that reason, any strategy to \r\ncombat trafficking must take into account the factors \r\nthat increase the risks to our children, as well as a \r\ngender perspective that will assist us in designing \r\nspecific actions to increase the effective protection of \r\nthose vulnerable populations.\r\nIn addition, one of the major challenges is to \r\nimprove data collection, given that trafficking extends \r\nthroughout the world, with millions of victims and a \r\nlarge number of cases remaining hidden. There have \r\nbeen major efforts to criminalize this human rights \r\nviolation, as reflected in the fact that 88 per cent of \r\ncountries have classified it as a criminal offence. \r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n8/32 17-30252\r\nUnfortunately, when it comes to carrying out the \r\nlaws, the sentencing rates are still low, with only 9,071 \r\nsentences reported globally in 2016.\r\nWe should recall that trafficking in persons is \r\ncommonly associated with trafficking in organs, \r\ndrugs and arms, and with money-laundering and \r\nother activities of organized crime. That is why a \r\ncomprehensive, coordinated focus is needed to fight all \r\nof those crimes and to coordinate actions in the fight \r\nagainst the supply and demand.\r\nA final challenge is support for victims. In many \r\ncases that is still inadequate, and we need policies and \r\nprogrammes that allow human-trafficking survivors to \r\nrebuild their lives and prevent revictimization. Since \r\n2013, Costa Rica has had a law to combat trafficking \r\nin persons, and we have been struggliing to fight this \r\nscourge through a national coalition addressing it in a \r\ncomprehensive and inter-institutional manner.\r\nFor our country, the fight against trafficking must \r\nbegin with awareness in all sectors. We have designed \r\nprogrammes to that end for the most relevant public \r\nofficials and institutions, ranging from the police who \r\nconduct raids to the judges who hear cases. We have \r\nalso involved civil society and the business sector, \r\nwhich play a fundamental role in the prevention and \r\ncombat of trafficking in persons.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Ecuador.\r\nMs. Moreno González (Ecuador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My delegation supports the statement made \r\nby the representative of Egypt yesterday on behalf of the \r\nGroup of Friends United Against Human Trafficking \r\n(see A/72/PV.24).\r\nThe Constitution of Ecuador expressly prohibits \r\nslavery, exploitation, servitude and the trafficking \r\nof persons. It recognizes the State’s role in adopting \r\nmeasures for the prevention and eradication of \r\nhuman trafficking and for the protection and social \r\nreintegration of victims of human trafficking and other \r\nforms of violations of liberty.\r\nMy country has made major progress in \r\nimplementing its national plan to combat trafficking \r\nin persons and the smuggling of migrants, sexual \r\nexploitation, labour exploitation and other forms of \r\nexploitation and prostitution. In that plan the axes of \r\naction are prevention, promotion of rights, assistance \r\nand the comprehensive protection of victims, as well \r\nas investigation, punishment and the strengthening of \r\ninternational cooperation in order to effectively fight \r\ntrafficking in persons and the smuggling of migrants, in \r\nline with the United Nations Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons. Our plan is implemented in an \r\nintegral manner through an inter-institutional committee \r\nwith a multidimensional focus and with competencies \r\nin the social, health, educational, productive, security, \r\nlegal and social control spheres.\r\nEcuador is party to the international instruments \r\nin this area. Therefore, the comprehensive criminal \r\ncode, which has been in force since 2014, classifies \r\nand punishes trafficking in persons as a grave violation \r\nof human rights. The penalization of the crime is \r\nconsistent with the provisions of the Palermo Protocol \r\nand in some aspects is a greater guarantor, because it \r\nbroadens the scope of the forms of exploitation subject \r\nto punishment.\r\nIn the interests of time, I would like to touch on \r\nonly some of the main successes in the different axes \r\nof action, such as the guarantee of special protection, \r\nassistance for victims of trafficking and migrant-\r\nsmuggling and restitution of their rights, and protecting \r\nthe safety and privacy of victims and their family. \r\nThe legislation classifying human trafficking as a \r\ncrime applies the principle of the non-punishability of \r\nvictims, which guarantees that a victim of trafficking is \r\nnot to be criminally tried or punished for any infraction \r\ncommitted during the time that he or she was trafficked.\r\nAnother major step forward is the elimination \r\nof the need to prove the means leading to the \r\ncrime — deception, fraud, threat and coercion. That \r\nmakes it easier for the justice system to prove the \r\nexistence of the crime.\r\nIn the area of alliances and international \r\ncoordination, Ecuador, recognizing that 94 per cent of \r\nthe victims in Latin America are captured, moved and \r\nexploited either within the country of origin or in the \r\nregion, acts in conjunction with neighbouring countries \r\nand countries in the region to develop preventive \r\nactions, break up criminal networks, rescue victims, \r\nand encourages various initiatives at the bilateral and \r\nregional levels.\r\n The interrelation between trafficking and migration \r\nis another vital topic. Ecuador is a country of origin, \r\ntransit, destination and return of persons in mobility. \r\nFor that particular reason, we have seen the need for a \r\nnew framework to strengthen the mechanisms to protect \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 9/32\r\nthe rights of those persons. We have adopted policies \r\nand specific national actions to prevent and punish \r\nany practice related to the trafficking and smuggling \r\nof migrants and to guarantee the restitution and \r\ncomprehensive reparation of the victims’ rights. That \r\nincludes the development of protocols, inter-institutional \r\ncoordination at the regional and international levels and \r\nprevention programmes, among other things.\r\nEcuador is grateful to the President of the General \r\nAssembly for having convened this high-level meeting, \r\nmaking it possible for us to evaluate and advance \r\nthe implementation of the Global Plan of Action to \r\nCombat Trafficking, and we applaude the adoption of \r\nthe poltical declaration (resolution 72/1) yesterday. It is \r\nessential to strengthen the political will of all States \r\nto end this criminal activity, which undermines human \r\ndignity and has negative effects on development, peace \r\nand security, and human rights. Ecuador reiterates its \r\nunwavering will in the fight against this crime, as well \r\nas its commitment to resolutely support the processes \r\nand measures that are carried out in this context.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of Mongolia.\r\nMr. Sukhee (Mongolia): At the very outset, let \r\nme express my delegation’s sincere gratitude to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening in \r\na timely manner this important high-level meeting to \r\nassess the implementation of Global Plan of Action to \r\nCombat Trafficking in Persons, which is designed to \r\nproduce a renewed political will and commitments to \r\nend the heinous crime of human trafficking.\r\nTrafficking in persons, especially women and \r\nchildren, constitutes a serious threat to human dignity, \r\nhuman rights and development. Poverty, unemployment, \r\nlack of socioeconomic opportunities, gender-based \r\nviolence, discrimination and marginalization are some \r\nof the contributing factors that make persons vulnerable \r\nto human trafficking in developing countries.\r\nRegarded as a source and, to a lesser extent, a \r\ndestination country, Mongolia is not immune to human \r\ntrafficking. Mongolia has acceded to the Protocol to \r\nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, \r\nEspecially Women and Children, supplementing the \r\nUnited Nations Convention against Transnational \r\nOrganized Crime, in 2008, and made significant and \r\nmade significant efforts towards enhancing its legal \r\nframework, including by adopting the Law on Combating \r\nTrafficking in Persons, the Law on Victim and Witness \r\nProtection, and the revised Criminal Code. While its \r\nlegal environment has been significantly improved, \r\nweaknesses persist in victim identification and the \r\nprosecution of cases in the country. Law enforcement \r\nand judges have an uneven general understanding \r\nof trafficking in persons and its related legislation. \r\nOften due to misleading interpretations, trafficking \r\noffenders tend to be prosecuted under a lesser offence. \r\nIn the past six years, 54 human trafficking cases were \r\ninvestigated and only 15 individuals were convicted of \r\nhuman trafficking.\r\nFour months ago, the National Programme to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons was renewed by the Government. \r\nGuided by the 3 Ps approach of prevention, protection \r\nand prosecution, the programme aims to strengthen \r\nlaw enforcement to detect, prosecute perpetrators and \r\nprotect victims. It is worth noting that the Network of \r\nAnti-Trafficking Non-Governmental Organizations in \r\nMongolia, an umbrella organization founded by 19 local \r\nnon-governmental organizations, actively participated \r\nin the development of the programme.\r\nWe believe that the current progress achieved and \r\nthe concerted efforts accelerated by Member States \r\nand international organizations as part of the Global \r\nPlan of Action present promising opportunities to \r\nadvance a holistic approach to combat trafficking in \r\npersons globally. Moving forward, we should fully \r\ntake advantage of innovation and advancement in \r\ninformation and communications technologies for a \r\nmore effective implementation of the Global Plan of \r\nAction. We also stress the need to intensify international \r\ncooperation, including capacity-building and technical \r\nassistance, especially for developing countries, to \r\ncombat trafficking in persons.\r\nIn conclusion, I am pleased to note that Mongolia \r\nis honoured to be serving the second year of its \r\nmembership in the Human Rights Council. As part \r\nof our endeavour to protect human rights and dignity \r\nworldwide, we reaffirm our firm commitment to \r\ncombat trafficking in persons.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Korneliou (Cyprus): We highly appreciate the \r\nopportunity to participate in this important meeting. In \r\naddition to the statement of the European Union, I would \r\nlike to make some remarks in my national capacity.\r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n10/32 17-30252\r\nSeven years ago, the international community, \r\nunited by the universal condemnation of trafficking \r\nin persons, joined efforts to implement globally an \r\naction plan to combat this heinous crime. Member \r\nStates, under the guidance of the United Nations, have \r\ndeveloped comprehensive anti-trafficking strategies and \r\nengaged in cross-border cooperation in investigations \r\nand prosecutions. They have taken measures for the \r\nrestoration of the human rights of victims and set in \r\nplace strategic partnerships with civil society, thus \r\njoining efforts for raising awareness and consciousness.\r\nThis high-level meeting reflects the strong \r\ncommitment of the international community to the fight \r\nagainst human trafficking. We are here today because we \r\nshare the fundamental belief that trafficking in persons \r\nis a grave violation of human rights and a shameful \r\ncrime against human dignity. No doubt, the most recent \r\ninclusion of targets on trafficking in persons in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development is very important. \r\nIn parallel, the efforts of the Council of Europe, the \r\nEuropean Union and other regional and international \r\norganizations that have joined this fight are also \r\ncrucial. Unfortunately, and despite our continuous \r\nefforts, statistics reiterate the extent of the problem, \r\nshowing that today more than 20 million persons are \r\nvictims of human trafficking, almost 6 million of whom \r\nare children.\r\nThe often unavoidable link between conflict and \r\nmigration means that people escaping from war and \r\npersecution may become victims of trafficking. In \r\nthat regard, the effective implementation of the United \r\nNations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons, under the global compact for safe, orderly \r\nand regular migration and the global compact on \r\nrefugees, creates a more solid and comprehensive \r\nframework to combat human trafficking. Prevention \r\nof trafficking in persons, protection and assistance to \r\nvictims, prosecution of perpetrators and strengthening \r\nof partnerships are also priorities of Cyprus. Our \r\ncontribution to the United Nations voluntary trust fund \r\nfor victims of trafficking in persons, especially women \r\nand children, underlines this commitment. All people \r\nare born free and equal. Our responsibility is to make \r\nsure that no person or child is deprived of the right to a \r\ndignified life.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Bulgaria.\r\nMr. Panayotov (Bulgaria): Bulgaria aligns itself \r\nwith the statement made by the observer of the European \r\nUnion (see A/72/PV.24).\r\nThe Government of Bulgaria is strongly committed \r\nto preventing and combating trafficking in persons, \r\nprosecuting the traffickers and protecting and assisting \r\nthe victims. Bulgaria emphasizes the importance of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons and welcomes this high-\r\nlevel meeting and the political declaration on the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons (resolution \r\n72/1), which renews the global commitment to \r\neliminating this heinous crime and ensuring protection \r\nof the victims, also in line with the responsibilities \r\nensuing from the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment to leave no one behind.\r\nTrafficking in persons is a grave human rights \r\nviolation and a highly lucrative form of transnational \r\norganized crime with huge human, social and economic \r\nimplications that requires a concerted global response. \r\nBulgaria emphasizes the importance of accelerating \r\ninternational cooperation to eliminate human \r\ntrafficking through a comprehensive, multidisciplinary \r\nand cross-border approach. Better cooperation should \r\nbe established among countries of origin, transit and \r\ndestination on information-sharing and victims’ \r\nidentification, support and reintegration, including in \r\nthe consolidation of transnational referral mechanisms \r\nand data-collection systems. Bulgaria reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to the implementation of the United \r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and \r\nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women \r\nand Children, supplementing the Convention, which \r\nconstitute a solid foundation of international law in this \r\narea, as well as Security Council resolution 2331 (2016).\r\nBulgaria was among the pioneers in Europe in \r\nadopting specialized anti-trafficking legislation back in \r\n2003, and currently it has one of the most comprehensive \r\ninstitutional frameworks to combat trafficking in \r\npersons. Bulgaria has penalized trafficking in persons \r\nand introduced more severe punishment for crimes \r\ninvolving children.\r\nBulgaria’s new national anti-trafficking strategy \r\nfor 2017-2021 contains the Government’s long-term \r\nvision to combat trafficking in persons. It places \r\nspecial emphasis on early detection and prevention and \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 11/32\r\nfollows a victim-centred, human rights-based, gender-\r\nspecific and child-focused approach, thereby enabling \r\na series of consultations with all stakeholders and an \r\nanalysis of ongoing trends. Special measures are taken \r\nto raise public awareness, especially among children, \r\nin partnership with local authorities, civil society \r\nand youth volunteers. The National Commission for \r\nCombating Trafficking in Human Beings coordinates \r\nthe State policy in this priority area and provides \r\nassistance for victims of trafficking in Government-\r\nfunded shelters, including specialized facilities for \r\nchild victims.\r\nIn recent years, Bulgaria has increased its capacity \r\nto ensure the rights of trafficking victims and has \r\nstepped up its participation in international efforts to \r\nfight this crime. Combating trafficking in persons will \r\nbe one of the priorities during the Bulgarian presidency \r\nof the Council of the European Union in the first \r\nsemester of 2018.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Saudi Arabia.\r\nMr. Al-Mouallimi (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, my delegation would like to \r\nthank the President, his team and all those in charge of \r\ndrawing up the United Nations Global Plan of Action \r\nto Combat Trafficking in Persons. We welcome the \r\nadoption of the Plan and all the tireless efforts deployed \r\nto that end.\r\nWe reaffirm the commitment and readiness of \r\nSaudi Arabia to help any efforts to end the crime of \r\nhuman trafficking and to work in cooperation with the \r\ninternational community, beginning with the adoption \r\nof national codes and legislation that are consistent both \r\nwith the vision of the United Nations for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and with the Kingdom’s 2030 Vision, \r\ntaking due account of the United Nations Global Plan \r\nof Action.\r\nMy country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, attaches \r\ngreat importance to the rights of citizens and foreign \r\nresidents in Saudi Arabia, whom we provide with all \r\nthe necessary care, consistent with sharia — Islamic \r\nlaw — which honours the values and dignity of human \r\nbeings and rejects anything that undermines them. That \r\nis why Saudi Arabia is among the first rank of countries \r\nin the fight against human trafficking.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has always been \r\namong the first countries to ratify United Nations \r\nprotocols to combat trafficking of human beings in \r\nall its forms, in particular crimes that affect women, \r\nchildren and persons with disabilities. We have ratified \r\n16 international conventions, including the Convention \r\nconcerning Forced or Compulsory Labour. We have \r\nalso played an active role in international efforts to \r\ncombat the crime of human trafficking. Last week, \r\nwe participated in the high-level meeting called by the \r\nPrime Minister of the United Kingdom, which issued \r\na declaration and a call for action to eliminate forced \r\nlabour, modern slavery and human trafficking. We \r\nsupported the declaration and the call to action alongside \r\nother countries. All of this confirms the international \r\nresolve to combat and eradicate these heinous crimes.\r\nAt the national level, in 2009, my Government \r\nenacted a code to combat human trafficking. An \r\nanti-human-trafficking committee was also established \r\nwithin the framework of the human rights body that \r\ncoordinates national efforts to combat and eradicate \r\nthose crimes in all their forms, and helps to raise \r\nawareness among the public. In addition, contact centres \r\nhave been established to offer their services to foreign \r\nworkers working in Saudi Arabia. These centres receive \r\ncomplaints and resolve disputes as quickly as possible \r\nin an effort to safeguard the rights of employers and \r\nemployees alike. The code also stipulates deterrent \r\npenalties against anyone found guilty of human \r\ntrafficking, including prison sentences of up to 15 years \r\nand significant fines. In some cases, the punishments \r\nstipulated by the code are more severe when crimes \r\ntarget women, children or persons with disabilities.\r\nMy delegation wishes to share with the \r\ninternational community a source of very grave \r\nconcern — the increase in crimes carried out by armed \r\ngroups connected with human trafficking in conflict \r\nzones, targeting women and children in particular. \r\nSuch crimes take advantage of the needs of the victims \r\nand the absence of proper structures, and represent a \r\nchallenge to the international community. We must \r\ncooperate at the international and national levels. With \r\nthis in mind, we call for greater information-sharing on \r\nthose who finance and encourage those crimes.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation reaffirms our \r\ncooperation with the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community, in particular on the protection \r\nof human beings from human trafficking. Penalties that \r\ndissuade those who might commit these crimes should \r\nbe encouraged. The negative psychological effects on \r\nvictims must also be taken into account.\r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n12/32 17-30252\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nthe Chair of the delegation of the United Republic \r\nof Tanzania.\r\nMr. Mero (United Republic of Tanzania): I thank \r\nthe President for the opportunity to make a statement \r\non this agenda item. Indeed, this high-level meeting is \r\ntimely, as the world is embarking on a global effort to \r\ncombat trafficking in persons.\r\nIt is an undeniable truth that, at some point, each \r\ncountry is affected by acts of human trafficking. \r\nWomen and children are among most vulnerable groups \r\naffected by this illegal phenomenon. Tanzania, like all \r\nother countries around the world, sees this as slavery \r\nin a disguised form. As we convene to appraise the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction against Trafficking in Persons, I stand here today \r\nto testify, on behalf of my Government, to the progress \r\nmade in the implementation of legal instruments set \r\nforth to combat trafficking in persons.\r\nTanzania has taken various initiatives to complement \r\nthe efforts of the international community in combating \r\ntrafficking in persons, including the ratification of \r\nthe relevant international legal instruments. The \r\nGovernment enacted the Anti-Trafficking in Persons \r\nAct No.6 in 2008, which prohibits all forms of \r\ntrafficking and prescribes punishments for perpetrators \r\nof human trafficking. The Act also established the \r\nNational Anti-Trafficking in Persons Committee and \r\nthe Anti-Trafficking in Persons Secretariat, with an \r\nannual budget allocated by the Government to facilitate \r\ntheir activities.\r\nThe Government has also developed a directory of \r\nservice providers for victims of human trafficking and \r\na manual for civil-society organizations in handling \r\nincidences of trafficking in persons. In addition, the \r\nGovernment has established guidelines for safe family \r\nreunification for victims of trafficking and drawn up \r\na training manual for law-enforcement officials on \r\nmatters related to trafficking in persons. In recognition \r\nof the importance of data to inform Government action, \r\nTanzania’s collaboration with development partners has \r\nestablished a national database on trafficking in persons \r\nas a means to inform policies and allocate funds.\r\nApart from the preparation of a national action plan \r\nto combat trafficking, Tanzania is also implementing \r\nthe standard operating procedures for the identification \r\nof and assistance to victims of trafficking in persons \r\nand for protecting, assisting and referring trafficked \r\nchildren. Moreover, Tanzania makes significant efforts \r\nto raise public awareness as a key to increasing the \r\npublic’s knowledge and understanding of the issues that \r\naffect the groups most vulnerable to human trafficking.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of Tanzania, I wish to \r\nacknowledge and appreciate the support that Tanzania \r\nhas been receiving from development partners in the \r\nfight against human trafficking. My country stands \r\nready to enhance partnerships to combat trafficking \r\nin persons as part of our commitment to the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, which envisions \r\nleaving no one behind, including with respect to this \r\nparticular scourge.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\ndeputy Chair of the delegation of Uruguay.\r\nMrs. Carrión (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI thank the President for convening this high-level \r\nmeeting and yesterday’s speakers for their briefings.\r\nWhile the concept of slavery as it was known \r\ncenturies ago has been abolished, we still face what \r\nis known as modern slavery. Trafficking in persons, \r\nthe sexual exploitation of children and adolescents, \r\nforced labour, forced marriage and debt bondage are \r\nsome aspects of that scourge, affecting millions of \r\npeople around the world. For Uruguay, its eradication \r\nis an extremely urgent goal and a priority within the \r\nframework of Sustainable Development Goal 8.7.\r\nUruguay emphatically condemns trafficking \r\nin persons and related crimes that seek to exploit \r\nindividuals and take advantage of their status or \r\nvulnerable situation, which implies disregarding their \r\nhuman nature and human rights. We must focus on the \r\nobjectives of combating those crimes and guaranteeing \r\nthe fundamental rights of victims by consolidating \r\nprevention and protection measures and mechanisms. \r\nUruguay considers it essential to give priority to the \r\nrights of victims of trafficking, who must be at the \r\ncentre of all efforts to prevent and combat that crime \r\nin order to protect them, provide them with assistance \r\nand reparation, and ensure that their dignity is restored.\r\nIt is also essential to guarantee recognition of the \r\nuniversality of human rights, based on the fact that the \r\nright to equality and non-discrimination is independent \r\nof gender, age, sexual orientation or identity, social, \r\neconomic or political status, ethnic or racial origin, or \r\nother characteristics of the individual and his or her \r\nfamily or community. It should be borne in mind that \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 13/32\r\nno conduct justifies a victim’s submission to conditions \r\nof exploitation, whether lawful or unlawful, regular or \r\nirregular, morally accepted or not by the community in \r\nwhich the act occurred — not even if it was consensual.\r\nUruguay has made international commitments in \r\njoining the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish \r\nTrafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, \r\nsupplementing the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime — also known as the \r\nPalermo Protocol, which was adopted in 2003. At the \r\nnational level, Uruguay has been acting in a focused \r\nmanner, particularly since 2008, with the creation \r\nof an inter-institutional round table to prevent and \r\ncombat trafficking in persons, made up of various \r\ngovernmental bodies and with the participation of \r\norganized civil society.\r\nIn recent years, the round table has focused its \r\nefforts on drafting a comprehensive bill to prevent and \r\ncombat trafficking in human beings, which will soon \r\nbe brought before Parliament for consideration and \r\napproval. In parallel to that process, work is under way \r\nto establish a plan to prevent and combat trafficking \r\nand exploitation of persons, which will be in force from \r\nJanuary 2018. It aims to identify specific and integrated \r\nactions in relation to that violation of human rights.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to emphasize that the \r\nonly way those practices can be prevented, denounced \r\nand ultimately eradicated is through the cooperation \r\nof all society at the local and national levels. In \r\nview of the international dimension of that crime, \r\ncooperation among States is also essential to combat \r\ntrafficking in persons, and to prosecute and condemn \r\nthose responsible.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nthe Chair of the delegation of the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela.\r\nMr. Ramírez Carreño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, we wish \r\nto express our country’s support for the statement made \r\nby the representative of Egypt on behalf of the Group of \r\nFriends United against Human Trafficking (see A/72/\r\nPV.24).\r\nTrafficking in persons is a despicable crime that \r\ninfringes upon human dignity and constitutes a serious \r\nviolation of human rights and all legal regulations on \r\nthat issue. We are concerned about the international \r\nincrease in that crime, the majority of whose victims \r\nare women and children. The various causes of and \r\nmotivations for such crimes have been exacerbated \r\nin recent years by poverty, social exclusion, lack of \r\naccess to education, high rates of youth unemployment, \r\nincreasingly restrictive and exclusive immigration \r\npolicies, inadequate channels for regular migration, \r\nand armed conflicts in various regions of the planet.\r\nFor Venezuela, prevention is the cornerstone of \r\nthe fight against trafficking in persons. Therefore, \r\nthe comprehensive approach to tackling this scourge \r\nrequires strengthening social policies and the fight \r\nagainst poverty and exclusion in order to prevent \r\nvulnerable groups — especially women and children, \r\nas well as refugees and migrants — from falling into \r\nnetworks of organized transnational crime\r\nThe international community is endowed with \r\nstrong legal instruments, such as the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and \r\nits Protocol, that need to be effectively implemented. \r\nWe also have the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons, which is an \r\nimportant point of reference and progress that sets out \r\ninternational commitments to eliminate this scourge.\r\nIn that context, the revision of the Plan that is \r\nbeing implemented this year obliges us to reiterate \r\nand strengthen the resolve of all States to fully comply \r\nwith the indisputable obligation to combat this heinous \r\ncrime by bolstering its preventive mechanisms, \r\naccountability, data and evidence collection, and, above \r\nall, a frank and inclusive international dialogue. It is \r\nalso necessary to recognize the important role played \r\nby the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \r\nand the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against \r\nTrafficking in Persons, as well as other entities of the \r\nUnited Nations system and other intergovernmental \r\norganizations, within the framework of their mandates.\r\nVenezuela stresses that efforts aimed at the \r\neffective prevention and eradication of that crime \r\nrequire the non-securitization of the issue and \r\nensuring broad and democratic discussion spaces that \r\nensure the full participation of all Member States \r\nof the United Nations. In that regard, Venezuela \r\nreiterates its categorical rejection of unilateral reports \r\nbased on subjective and political perceptions, which \r\nweaken multilateralism rather than contributing to its \r\nstrengthening, and politicize the issue, undermining \r\nnational and international efforts to fight that crime.\r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n14/32 17-30252\r\nAmong the causes and motivations that have \r\nexacerbated the rates of this crime in recent years are \r\nconflict situations and military invasions, especially in \r\nthe Middle East and North Africa. Military occupation \r\naimed at dismantling the institutions of the country \r\nwhere intervention has taken place leaves the entire \r\npopulation, as well as migrants, refugees and displaced \r\npersons at the mercy of criminal gangs who use their \r\ntragedy and helplessness to abuse them, turning them \r\ninto a commodity to be traded, often for the benefit of \r\ninterest groups or countries that exploit them at will.\r\nThe crime of trafficking in persons is not prevalent \r\nin Venezuela, and our financial system does not \r\nbenefit from the profits therefrom. The Venezuelan \r\nlegal framework related to this matter is contained, \r\nin the first instance, in our Constitution, as well as in \r\nthe different organic laws that ratify the international \r\nprotocols in the matter.\r\nIn conclusion, Venezuela reiterates its commitment \r\nto respect and to the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights. We also reaffirm our commitment and \r\nwillingness to continue to fulfil our obligations under \r\nthe United Nations Convention against Transnational \r\nOrganized Crime, and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress \r\nand Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women \r\nand Children, and other international legal instruments \r\nrelated to the subject.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\ndeputy Chair of the delegation of Switzerland.\r\nMr. Zehnder (Switzerland) (spoke in French): This \r\nmeeting is an excellent opportunity to reaffirm our \r\npolitical commitment in the fight against trafficking \r\nin human beings. The current large migratory f lows \r\nconfront us with new challenges. They require us \r\nto re-evaluate the gaps in prevention, protection, \r\nprosecution and partnership, namely, the four pillars \r\ndesignated by the United Nations Global Plan of Action. \r\nAllow me to raise the following three points.\r\nFirst, humanitarian crises and armed conflict are \r\nparticular challenges in the fight against trafficking. \r\nHumanitarian actors are increasingly confronted with \r\nthis phenomenon and have a role to play in prevention \r\nand protection. It is important that humanitarian actors, \r\nalongside their development partners, strengthen their \r\ncommitment and coordination in this regard.\r\nSecondly, it must be clearly recognized that \r\nforced displacement and migration create particular \r\nvulnerabilities and opportunities for trafficking and \r\nexploitation, including exploitation through labour. \r\nLoss of livelihood, lack of legal access to the labour \r\nmarket and high sums paid to traffickers are but a \r\nfew of the causes that encourage exploitation through \r\nlabour. In November 2016 in Geneva, Switzerland \r\nparticipated — with several United Nations agencies \r\nand international actors — in a conference on combating \r\ntrafficking in persons for forced labour along migration \r\nroutes. On that occasion, the role of the private sector \r\nwas brought up. Switzerland supports the important \r\nwork of Ms. Giammarinaro, the Special Rapporteur on \r\ntrafficking in persons, especially women and children, \r\nwho launched an initiative to strengthen multiparty \r\nactions and strategies of the industry coalition.\r\nThirdly, on 18 October, on the occasion of the \r\nEuropean Day for Combating Trafficking in Human \r\nBeings, Switzerland will launch the third week of action \r\nagainst trafficking in human beings. Awareness-raising \r\nactivities will be organized throughout the country. \r\nAn excellent example of partnership, the campaign is \r\ninspired and coordinated by a group of State actors and \r\ncivil society.\r\nFinally, I would like to conclude by stressing once \r\nagain the importance of the ongoing negotiations \r\non the global compact for safe, orderly and regular \r\nmigration. The latter represents an opportunity to \r\nintegrate principles and strategies to combat trafficking \r\nin human beings in the international dialogue on \r\nmigration. Discussions at the start of the month in \r\nVienna at the fifth thematic session on smuggling of \r\nmigrants, trafficking in persons and contemporary \r\nforms of slavery, including appropriate identification, \r\nprotection and assistance to migrants and trafficking \r\nvictims, have already prepared the ground for this.\r\nThe role of civil society in identifying and \r\nprotecting victims of trafficking remains key. We \r\ncannot fulfil our mission without it. Thus, Switzerland \r\nwill contribute up to 80,000 Swiss francs to the United \r\nNations voluntary trust fund for victims of trafficking \r\nin persons, especially women and children.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Hungary.\r\nMs. Bogyay (Hungary): Hungary aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered on behalf of the European \r\nUnion and its member States (see A/72/PV.24) and \r\nwelcomes the adoption of the political declaration on \r\nthe implementation of the United Nations Global Plan \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 15/32\r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons (resolution \r\n72/1).\r\nHuman trafficking is one of the most horrific \r\ncrimes of our times. It is an open wound on the body \r\nof humankind. Sadly, it occurs in every country, every \r\nregion, all around the world and is therefore a truly \r\noutstanding global challenge. Transnational criminal \r\nnetworks take advantage of the most vulnerable and \r\nmarginalized members of societies. They deprive their \r\nvictims not only of freedom but also of human dignity.\r\nI am convinced that we cannot win this fight alone. \r\nThere must be effective cooperation and partnership \r\nbetween the countries of origin, destination and transit, \r\nas well as among States, international organizations, \r\ncivil society and business groups, including through the \r\nmechanism of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group \r\nagainst Trafficking in Persons. Hungary believes in \r\ndialogue, in collaboration and coordination between \r\nall relevant stakeholders. We have just hosted a panel \r\ndiscussion related to human trafficking on protecting \r\nreligious minorities and another one, the United Nations \r\nConference of the Global Sustainability Network, \r\nwhich has a growing membership of more than 300 \r\nsocially conscious philanthropists, businesswomen \r\nand men, very influential change-makers, movers and \r\nshakers. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and \r\nTrade hosted regional consultations for the Workshop \r\nof Alliance 8.7 for Europe and Central Asia jointly \r\norganized by the International Labour Organization.\r\nWe also believe that raising awareness is crucial \r\nboth at the national and global levels. In that respect, \r\nthe media, the advocacy groups and civil society are \r\nimportant partners. This is the reason, for example, \r\nwhy I hosted the Foreign Press Association Scholarship \r\nFund Awards in May, addressing the topic of human \r\ntrafficking and the role of the international media in \r\nshining a light on the great moral and societal issues of \r\nour times. With the same aim of putting modern slavery \r\nin the spotlight, Hungary works together with different \r\nmedia companies, filmmakers and journalists.\r\nBesides empowering all stakeholders so that they \r\nbecome conscious consumers, vigilant law-enforcement \r\nofficers, trained humanitarian and peacekeeping \r\npersonnel, dedicated policymakers and safe Internet \r\nusers, we need to empower the survivors. Today I am \r\nasking how we can implement the United Nations Global \r\nPlan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons more \r\neffectively. First, our actions need to be tailored to the \r\nspecific case at hand. Our response has to be gender- \r\nand age-sensitive as well as exploitation-type-specific. \r\nSecondly, persecution and prevention should go \r\nhand in hand. Thirdly, collecting and analysing data \r\nis of key importance. Fourthly, investigations into \r\nhuman trafficking should always include parallel \r\nand complementary financial investigations of \r\nhuman-trafficking networks. And, fifthly, ensuring \r\naccountability is essential. States should step up their \r\nefforts aimed at finding perpetrators and bringing them \r\nto justice.\r\nOur commitment is to keep these issues on the \r\nagenda as a priority, and I encourage Member States to \r\nengage in strengthened cooperation in law enforcement, \r\ninvestigations and information-sharing. We need a \r\nplanetary consciousness in this regard. We need to \r\nshare our information, data and knowledge and start \r\ncoordinating our actions. Let us work together.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Ireland.\r\nMs. Nason (Ireland): I am here today because my \r\ncountry, Ireland, stands full-square with all who want to \r\nbring an end to the scourge of the trafficking of people. \r\nWe applaud the convening of this meeting to shine a \r\nlight on the tens of millions of victims worldwide. We \r\nalso join in solidarity and, importantly, with resolve, to \r\nend the horrors of exploitation and abuse endured by \r\nthose victims.\r\nIreland aligns itself fully with the statement \r\ndelivered by the observer of the European Union (see \r\nA/72/PV.24). The European Union and its member \r\nStates play a leading role globally in working to prevent \r\nand combat human trafficking. Ireland also salutes the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of Panama \r\non behalf of the Human Security Network (see A/72/\r\nPV.24).\r\nJust under one year ago, Ireland adopted a robust \r\nnational action plan to prevent and combat human \r\ntrafficking. We worked in consultation with national \r\nand international partners, including civil society, to set \r\nout a state-of-the-art, clear, collaborative programme \r\nto advance the fight against trafficking and also, \r\nimportantly, to enhance the protection of victims.\r\nOur response to human trafficking benefits from the \r\nrigorous domestic scrutiny and international evaluation \r\nin which we engage — and I underline — on a regular \r\nbasis. We have created a dedicated State structure and \r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n16/32 17-30252\r\nenacted and updated major parts of our legislation to \r\nimplement the United Nations Global Plan of Action to \r\nCombat Trafficking in Persons. But through all of that \r\nwork, we remain singularly focused on the paramount \r\nneed to place all victims, but particularly women and \r\ngirls, who are the majority of victims of trafficking, \r\nright at the heart of our response. We have taken a \r\nnumber of very concrete operational steps to achieve \r\nthat end, and today I will briefly highlight just four \r\nof those.\r\nMrs. Pobee (Ghana), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nFirst, a dedicated anti-human-trafficking unit has \r\nbeen established within our Department of Justice \r\nand Equality. That unit is responsible for an across-\r\nGovernment coordination policy and response, bringing \r\ntogether those State and non-State actors I mentioned \r\nearlier in partnership.\r\nSecondly, we have in place a centralized human-\r\ntrafficking investigation and coordination unit within \r\nour national police service. The unit has top-level \r\nexpertise on sex crimes, child protection, Internet \r\nexploitation, organized prostitution and associated \r\ncrimes. It engages actively in international police work \r\naimed at tackling those gangs that engage in trafficking \r\nacross borders.\r\nThirdly, we have established a dedicated \r\nanti-human-trafficking team within our health service \r\nthat responds to individual victims with dedicated care \r\nplans for them.\r\nFourthly, we have a responsive national referral \r\nmechanism that works for suspected victims of \r\ntrafficking and looks to their immediate needs and \r\nensures they can avail themselves of ongoing supports \r\nto aid in their recovery. Ireland’s criminal justice \r\nsystem today also includes prosecution and prevention \r\nmeasures based on our legislation that combats the \r\ncrime of trafficking but also reduces or aims to reduce \r\nthe demand for trafficking.\r\nAnother important aspect that we believe leads to \r\neffective implementation is that we are working on a \r\ntrue partnership basis in which State and non-State \r\nagencies come together in a way that allows us to \r\nensure that suspected victims are identified at the \r\nearliest opportunity. Furthermore, on an ongoing \r\nbasis, we are improving training for those agencies and \r\nnon-governmental actors to raise public awareness of \r\nthe dimensions of this disaster. The anti-trafficking \r\nwork that we do in our non-governmental sector is \r\nsupported not just in kind, but also funded by the State \r\nin many cases. We see the work in Governmental and \r\nnon-governmental contexts as absolutely fundamental \r\nand complementary. In sum, my country, Ireland, \r\nis doing everything in its power to address this \r\nhorrific scourge.\r\nI want to finish by thanking the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for organizing this valuable meeting. \r\nIn particular, I want to echo the Secretary-General in \r\nhis own powerful concluding remarks yesterday:\r\n“As long as this crime exists we cannot tell \r\nyoung people that the future will be better than \r\nthe past. We cannot deliver on a world of hope \r\nand opportunity for all, and we dare not look at \r\nourselves without a sense of abiding shame. Now \r\nis the time to stand together and stamp out this \r\nabominable practice.” (A/72/PV.24, p.3)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Georgia.\r\nMr. Imnadze (Georgia): Trafficking in persons, \r\nespecially women and children, is among the most \r\nf lagrant violations of human rights of our time. The \r\nUnited Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons serves as a major framework for \r\npromoting a comprehensive, coordinated and consistent \r\nresponse at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels to counter human trafficking.\r\nAs a State signatory to the anti-trafficking \r\nprotocol, Georgia reiterates its commitment to spare \r\nno effort to prevent trafficking, punish the perpetrators \r\nand protect the victims. Our policy is focused on the \r\nso-called four “Ps”: prevention, protection, prosecution \r\nand partnership. To that end, Georgia has put in place \r\na responsive legislative framework. For example, \r\nsince 2003, human trafficking has been explicitly \r\ncriminalized under our criminal code. In 2006, we \r\nadopted the law on combating trafficking in human \r\nbeings, aimed at prevention, protection and prosecution \r\nof trafficking offenders. In 2012, that law was amended \r\nto provide social and legal protection, assistance and \r\nrehabilitation for child victims, in accordance with the \r\nrecommendation code were refined to streamline the \r\ninvestigation process.\r\nWe are aware that combating trafficking in \r\nhuman beings requires concerted inter-agency effort. \r\nTherefore, in 2006, we created an inter-agency council \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 17/32\r\nto act as a major shaper of policy in combating human \r\ntrafficking. The council brings together representatives \r\nfrom all concerned line ministries and agencies, \r\nincluding the Chief Prosecutor’s Office and Public \r\nDefender’s Office, as well as non-governmental and \r\ninternational organizations.\r\nOur national action plan for the period 2017-\r\n2018 focuses in particular on proactive methods for \r\nidentifying victims. To that end, human-trafficking-\r\ninspection mobile groups and a related task force \r\nwere set up, composed of representatives of law-\r\nenforcement agencies that regularly operate in high-\r\nrisk areas. In addition, we have retrained investigators \r\nto develop their skills and raise their awareness with \r\nregard to human trafficking. As a result, the number of \r\ninvestigations, prosecutions and convictions has been \r\nincreasing annually.\r\nWithin the institutional arrangements for protecting \r\nand assisting victims of trafficking in persons, the State \r\nfund for the protection of and assistance to trafficking \r\nvictims continues to provide shelters and a crisis \r\ncentre, legal aid, psychological and medical assistance, \r\nand victim rehabilitation and reintegration. We also \r\npay particular attention to the protection of vulnerable \r\ngroups in the population. Children in street situations \r\nare at the centre of our attention. A number of legislative \r\nand institutional measures have been taken to provide \r\nthose children with identification documents, register \r\nthem for State-run services and promote a prompt \r\nresponse should any violence be committed against \r\nthem. I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nemphasize that increased international efforts are \r\nneeded to protect the most vulnerable groups of the \r\npopulation, including internally displaced persons and \r\nrefugees, from trafficking.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate my country’s \r\ncommitment to further contributing to our joint efforts \r\nto prevent and combat human trafficking.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Kazakhstan.\r\nMr. Umarov (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan welcomes \r\nthe official adoption of the political declaration on the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons (resolution \r\n72/1).\r\nWe associate ourselves with the statement made \r\nyesterday by the representative of Egypt on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Friends United against Human Trafficking \r\n(see A/72/PV.24).\r\nWe highly value the active role played by, and the \r\ncontribution of, the United Nations, in particular the \r\nInter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking \r\nin Persons and its coordinator, the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), in providing \r\nspecialized assistance to Member States at their request. \r\nThe 2016 UNODC Global Report on Trafficking in \r\nPersons confirms that this scourge is essentially \r\nan international phenomenon and that cross-border \r\ntrafficking in persons is by and large the consequence \r\nof general migration f lows. According to the 156 \r\nMember States that responded, of most of the victims \r\nidentified worldwide, approximately 60 per cent were \r\nforeigners or migrants.\r\nAs a member of the Group of Friends United \r\nagainst Human Trafficking, Kazakhstan supports \r\nall international efforts aimed at counteracting this \r\nform of modern slavery and calls on all States to fully \r\nand effectively implement the Global Plan of Action. \r\nKazakhstan is proud to be one of the contributors to \r\nthe United Nations voluntary trust fund for victims \r\nof trafficking in persons, especially for women and \r\nchildren, and calls upon other States for financial \r\nsupport to fight against trafficking in human beings. \r\nIn December 2012, in his address to the nation on \r\nthe Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy, President Nursultan \r\nNazarbayev said, “The State should especially severely \r\npunish blatant cases of sexual slavery and attitudes \r\ntowards women as a commodity.”\r\nRecognizing the need to increase the State’s \r\nresponse to human trafficking so as to protect the \r\nvulnerable and bring perpetrators to justice, the \r\nGovernment of Kazakhstan has developed numerous \r\naction plans to combat human trafficking. We are \r\ncurrently implementing the 2015-2017 action plan, \r\nwhich envisages the coherent functioning of all the \r\nrelevant national agencies and non-governmental \r\norganizations, in line with the political will to end \r\nimpunity for traffickers. To that end, a national \r\ninter-agency coordination body has been created. I \r\nwould like to mention just few measures that Kazakhstan \r\nhas undertaken to help victims of trafficking.\r\nWe have established a national referral mechanism \r\nand introduced social standards to assist victims, \r\nand we are regulating the identification procedure \r\nfor victims of human trafficking. Furthermore, our \r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n18/32 17-30252\r\npreventive campaign “Stop Traffic” was carried out in \r\na systematic manner. Our Government regularly keeps \r\ntrack of the activities carried out by modelling, tourist \r\nand marriage agencies that offer foreign travel and \r\nemployment services, and monitors mass media and the \r\nInternet with a view to detecting materials related to \r\ntrafficking in persons and child pornography.\r\nIt is important to note that our fight against this \r\nheinous crime is centred on human rights. We are party \r\nto and implement more than 60 multilateral treaties \r\non human rights, including 13 directly related to \r\ncounteracting contemporary forms of slavery, and we \r\nare ensuring an integrated approach to combating crime. \r\nWe are implementing a State programme designed to \r\nfurther modernize the law-enforcement system, whose \r\nmain task is to create by 2020 a system that meets high \r\ninternational standards.\r\nAware that no single actor can successfully fight \r\nhuman trafficking alone, Kazakhstan is actively \r\ncooperating not only with United Nations entities, but \r\nalso with other international, regional organizations \r\nand civil society. Upon Kazakhstan’s initiative, the \r\nSpecial Representative and Coordinator for Combating \r\nTrafficking in Human Beings of the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is planning \r\nto conduct a regional multi-stakeholder simulation \r\ntraining exercise on the identification of trafficking \r\nin human beings at the Central Asian regional hub for \r\ncountering global threats next year. We express our \r\ndeep appreciation for the work being done by the OSCE \r\nSpecial Representative and Coordinator.\r\nWith financial and technical support from the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM) and \r\nthe Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan, the \r\nUnion of Crisis Centres has been running the national \r\nSOS hotline since 2010. The IOM also supported the \r\npublication of the first report on combating trafficking \r\nin human beings in Kazakhstan, which was prepared by \r\nthe Commission on Human Rights, under the President \r\nof Kazakhstan.\r\nWe hope today’s discussions of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action will help to fulfil our intention to \r\nturn our words into decisive, concerted action.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nMr. Alshamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, I would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General and the United Nations Office on \r\nDrugs and Crime for their comprehensive reports. \r\nOn behalf of my country, I welcome the adoption of \r\nthe political declaration on the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons (resolution 72/1).\r\nThe United Arab Emirates deals seriously with the \r\nissue of trafficking in persons, not only at the national \r\nlevel but throughout the world, based on our conviction \r\nthat trafficking in persons constitutes a f lagrant \r\nviolation of human rights and a serious form of disregard \r\nfor human, religious and cultural values. Because the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates hosts a significant number of \r\ntemporary workers of many different nationalities \r\neach year, we have committed to working tirelessly to \r\ncombat this crime and counter criminal gangs.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates launched its campaign to \r\naddress this crime both nationally and internationally in \r\n2006, when it started a comprehensive anti-trafficking \r\ncampaign and enacted a federal law on combating \r\ntrafficking in persons. This law was amended in \r\n2015 to provide greater guarantees for victims of \r\nhuman trafficking, in line with the Trafficking in \r\nPersons Protocol.\r\nIn 2008, the National Committee to Combat \r\nHuman Trafficking was established. It includes \r\nrepresentatives from Government agencies and civil-\r\nsociety organizations and aims at coordinating efforts \r\nto combat human trafficking crimes, strengthening \r\nstrategic plans at various levels and enabling the \r\nauthorities to enforce laws and implement preventive \r\nand deterrent measures.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has adopted a national \r\nstrategy that comprises several aspects. In terms \r\nof prevention and prohibition, the United Arab \r\nEmirates has enacted laws and legislation to combat \r\nthe trafficking of persons. These laws are regularly \r\nupdated to keep them in line with the Trafficking in \r\nPersons Protocol and relevant international legislation. \r\nAs part of the efforts to prevent and enhance awareness \r\nof this crime, a diploma programme on anti-trafficking \r\nis being offered in the United Arab Emirates. The \r\nprogramme deals with the crime of human trafficking \r\nusing a scientific approach.\r\nIn terms of prosecution and punishment, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates is committed to pursuing and \r\nprosecuting the perpetrators of human trafficking. The \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 19/32\r\nefforts of national law-enforcement agencies have led \r\nto the arrest of 106 traffickers to date.\r\nAs to protecting and supporting victims of human \r\ntrafficking, the United Arab Emirates has provided \r\nprotection for and guaranteed the legal and human \r\nrights of the victims of trafficking and exploitation \r\nthrough State-sponsored shelters and rehabilitation \r\ncentres. The United Arab Emirates has also arranged \r\nfor and facilitated continued residency in the country or \r\nreturn to their countries of origin of victims, according \r\nto their circumstances, while ensuring their safety \r\nand security.\r\nIn conclusion, the United Arab Emirates emphasizes \r\nthe importance and effectiveness of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to address this global scourge \r\nand will continue to cooperate with the international \r\ncommunity through the exchange of information and \r\nstatistics so as to develop best practices and experiences \r\nin that regard. In addition, the United Arab Emirates is \r\npleased to announce its pledge of $100,000 in financial \r\nsupport for the United Nations voluntary trust fund for \r\nvictims of trafficking in persons, especially women \r\nand children, in order to ensure that the fight against \r\ntrafficking remains a common goal and shared objective \r\nfor all the nations of the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Honduras.\r\nMs. Cerrato (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish): In \r\n2010, the General Assembly adopted the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons. \r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to systematically and \r\nforcefully condemning trafficking.\r\nTrafficking in persons continues to be a serious \r\nproblem for humankind. It requires a concerted \r\ninternational response as well as efforts by States \r\nto develop and implement effective measures for \r\ncombating and eliminating trafficking in all of its \r\nforms and to strengthen existing measures to eliminate \r\nthe demand for victims of trafficking. The Constitution \r\nof Honduras states that,\r\n“The human person is the supreme goal of society \r\nand the State. Everyone has the obligation to \r\nrespect and protect it. The dignity of the human \r\nbeing is inviolable.”\r\nWe acknowledge that all anti-trafficking measures and \r\ninitiatives must not discriminate or fail to take gender \r\nequality into account, tailoring its approach to the \r\nneeds of women and children.\r\nAs a State party to the United Nations Convention \r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime and its \r\nProtocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking \r\nin Persons, Especially Women and Children, and \r\nin line with those obligations, Honduras has had \r\nlegislation against trafficking in place since 2012. This \r\nlegislation penalizes all forms of the crime, including \r\nthe recruitment of young people for criminal activities.\r\nIt is important to highlight the fact that the United \r\nNations has taken note of the decline of the homicide \r\nrate in Honduras. During his visit to the country in \r\nJanuary 2015, former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nacknowledged the Government’s measures to improve \r\nthe security situation and noted that the homicide \r\nrate had significantly decreased since 2013 — from \r\n86 homicides out of every 100,000 people to 66. \r\nFurthermore, the Government of the Republic created \r\nan inter-institutional commission against commercial \r\nsexual exploitation and trafficking in persons that \r\ncomprises Government institutions and civil-society \r\norganizations that play a key role in preventing and \r\ncombating human trafficking. In addition, a plan of \r\naction has been developed and implemented and will \r\nremain in force until 2022.\r\nIn the New York Declaration for Refugees and \r\nMigrants, we committed to using all of the means \r\nat our disposal to strive to counter the abuses and \r\nexploitation that countless refugees and migrants in \r\nvulnerable situations are suffering. The journeys that \r\nare being undertaken every day increase the likelihood \r\nthat these people will fall victim to criminal groups. \r\nConsequently, Honduras has implemented measures \r\nto improve the identification and protection of and \r\nassistance to victims of trafficking. One such measure \r\nis the strengthening of consular offices on the migratory \r\nroute in Mexico and the United States of America.\r\nWe should not forget that the purpose of the \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime is \r\nto establish and promote global, regional, subregional \r\nand bilateral cooperation to prevent and combat \r\ntransnational organized crime more effectively. \r\nAccordingly, we acknowledge that if countries act in a \r\ncoordinated manner, criminal networks will ultimately \r\nbe undone.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor the \r\nChair of the delegation of Viet Nam.\r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n20/32 17-30252\r\nMrs. Nguyen (Viet Nam): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening this important high-level meeting.\r\nViet Nam welcomes the adoption of resolution 72/1, \r\non the implementation of the United Nations Global \r\nPlan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.\r\nTrafficking in persons is a heinous crime that \r\nviolates human rights and human dignity and poses a \r\nserious challenge to peace, security and development. \r\nViet Nam strongly condemns and resolutely combats \r\ntrafficking in persons, especially women and children, \r\nand related transnational crimes, by implementing \r\nvarious comprehensive policies and measures, in line \r\nwith the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nAccordingly, I would like to highlight five of those \r\npolicies and measures.\r\nFirst, we have already ratified the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and \r\nits Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking \r\nin Persons, Especially Women and Children. Our \r\nGovernment has amended the national penal code to \r\ncriminalize trafficking in persons in all its forms. \r\nWe have established an inter-agency mechanism for \r\ncoordination and are implementing a national four-\r\nyear anti-trafficking action plan for 2016-2020, with \r\na focus on preventing, investigating, prosecuting and \r\npunishing crimes of trafficking in persons and on \r\nassisting victims.\r\nSecondly, to address the root causes of the problem, \r\nwe have actively implemented numerous programmes \r\non poverty reduction, education, employment, female \r\nempowerment and child protection. Using the media \r\nand the Internet, we have made great efforts to raise \r\npeople’s awareness, particularly among potential \r\nvictims and in areas where human traffickers are active.\r\nThirdly, trafficked victims are placed at the centre \r\nof our policies and actions. We have established hotlines \r\nto receive information and created temporary shelters \r\nto protect and assist victims. Support is provided to \r\nvictims to help them rebuild their lives through various \r\nrehabilitation and reintegration programmes, including \r\nfood and medical services, vocational training and \r\npsychological counselling, and legal consultations.\r\nFourthly, we impose severe and punitive measures \r\nto combat the horrendous trafficking phenomenon. \r\nPerpetrators are prosecuted, convicted and sentenced, \r\nreceiving punishment in the form of three to 20 years \r\nof imprisonment.\r\nFifthly, we attach great importance to regional \r\napproaches and mechanisms and actively promote the \r\nimplementation of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, \r\nTrafficking in Persons and Related Transnational \r\nCrime, the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative \r\nAgainst Trafficking and the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations Convention against Trafficking in \r\nPersons, Especially Women and Children. We have also \r\nsigned anti-trafficking memorandums of understanding \r\nwith China and Cambodia with a view to cooperating \r\nin the identification of victims and the prosecution \r\nof traffickers.\r\nTrafficking in persons affects almost all countries, \r\nbe they countries of origin, transit or destination. We \r\ncall on the global community to enhance cooperation \r\nto combat trafficking in persons, as no country can do \r\nit alone.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate Viet Nam’s \r\ncommitment to working closely with the United Nations \r\nand other partners to turn our declaration into actions \r\nthat end this heinous crime.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\ndeputy Chair of the delegation of El Salvador.\r\nMr. Jaime Calderón (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): It is an honour for me to be able to address \r\nthis high-level meeting to appraise the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.\r\nEl Salvador welcomes the significant progress \r\nmade at the regional and global levels in combating \r\nhuman trafficking. At the same time, it recognizes \r\nthat we continue to face numerous challenges in terms \r\nof successfully combating this global scourge and \r\nattending effectively and expeditiously to its victims.\r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to ensuring human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms for all without any \r\ndiscrimination whatsoever, while placing special \r\nemphasis on the protection and restitution of the rights \r\nof victims of trafficking. In that regard, El Salvador, \r\nthrough its 2003 ratification of the Protocol to Prevent, \r\nSuppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially \r\nWomen and Children, supplementing the United \r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime, undertook significant steps towards preventing, \r\ninvestigating and punishing the crime of human \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 21/32\r\ntrafficking, and towards focusing on restoring victims’ \r\nrights.\r\nIn 2004, trafficking in persons was added to the \r\npenal code, and, in 2005 the national committee against \r\ntrafficking in persons was established. The committee \r\nwas operational until 2011, when it was replaced by \r\nthe national council against trafficking in persons, to \r\nbecome the office responsible for the prevention of \r\ntrafficking and the comprehensive care of victims. In \r\n2012, the council adopted our national policy against \r\ntrafficking in persons, which set guidelines for the \r\ninstitutions responsible for its implementation and \r\nensured the formulation and implementation of a \r\nnational plan.\r\nIn 2014, the special law against trafficking in \r\npersons was adopted. The law went into effect in \r\nJanuary 2015 and established the modalities of action \r\nfor the national policy against trafficking in persons, \r\nthereby reinforcing the ways in which the policy against \r\ntrafficking, which had already been in force since 2012, \r\ncould be implemented. This normative framework \r\npromotes concrete actions designed to identify possible \r\ncases of human trafficking through awareness-\r\nraising activities as well as to prevent such cases. The \r\nframework also comprises concrete measures focused \r\non providing care for victims as well as protecting and \r\nrestoring their rights — the ultimate goal in that regard \r\nbeing the unconditional respect for human rights that \r\nhave been violated.\r\nWe have also run campaigns, such as the “The \r\npath of life is not always what you may imagine” and \r\n“Trafficking in women is a crime: let us raise our voice” \r\ncampaigns, which were launched in cooperation with \r\nthe regional coalition against trafficking in persons and \r\nmigrant smuggling. Similarly, the Attorney General’s \r\nOffice is now endowed with a specialized prosecutorial \r\nunit for crimes involving illegal trafficking and \r\ntrafficking in persons. The Office has also established \r\nan alert system called “Missing Angel”, which helps to \r\nlocate children and adolescents who have disappeared, \r\npossibly owing to trafficking in persons. The system \r\nprovides the public with a toll-free telephone number \r\nfor people to call and report cases of trafficking.\r\nTrafficking in persons affects practically all \r\ncountries of the world, whether they are a point of \r\norigin, transit or destination, It is therefore important \r\nthat we coordinate efforts to combat this crime, bring \r\nabout a more effective implementation of the Protocol \r\nat the national level, and show greater cooperation at \r\nboth national and international levels.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Bahrain.\r\nMr. Alrowaiei (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): I thank \r\nthe President of the General Assembly for having \r\nconvened this extremely important high-level meeting.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the adoption of the political \r\ndeclaration on the implementation of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \r\n(resolution 72/1). For us, the declaration represents an \r\nimportant step forward in finding a collective response \r\nto this multidimensional phenomenon. We should also \r\nstrive to achieve the rapid implementation of the goals \r\nset forth in the United Nations Global Plan of Action \r\nagainst Trafficking in Persons, contained in resolution \r\n64/293, as well as the relevant Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and their targets, in particular Goal 8 and target \r\n8.7.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain has ratified a number \r\nof declarations aimed at combating this phenomenon, \r\nincluding the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime and its supplementary \r\nProtocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in \r\nPersons, Especially Women and Children. Furthermore, \r\nin 2007, we adopted a national law to combat trafficking \r\nin persons. This law defines what constitutes human \r\ntrafficking and entails severe punishments for any \r\nindividual or entity guilty of exploiting or trafficking \r\nworkers. We have also established a national commission \r\naimed at combating human trafficking, which is an \r\neffective mechanism for ensuring the physical and \r\nmental well-being of victims and providing them with \r\nthe physical protection they need.\r\nIn 2015, we inaugurated a service and support centre \r\nfor foreigners as well as a hotline in eight different \r\nlanguages for people to report cases of trafficking. \r\nWe also published a guide that was translated into \r\nvarious languages and distributed to foreign workers \r\nupon their arrival in the Kingdom to inform them of \r\ntheir rights and the communications channels open to \r\nthem. Furthermore, the national committee to combat \r\ntrafficking in persons set up a national programme \r\nto bring together the relevant authorities to address \r\ncases of human trafficking. It is a unique system at the \r\nregional level which allows us to reinforce measures \r\ntaken at the international level by defining the roles \r\nof the various parts of the mechanism that deals \r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n22/32 17-30252\r\nwith presumed or proven cases of human trafficking, \r\nincluding their prosecution. An executive office was \r\nalso established, bringing together representatives of \r\nvarious Government and other public entities, and is \r\naimed at ensuring cooperation with the private sector, \r\nas well as raising awareness. Given the scope of the \r\nphenomenon, we have organized a number of various \r\nactivities, seminars, conferences and workshops on the \r\nsubject so as to raise awareness.\r\nWe are well aware of the harmful effects of armed \r\nconflict in various regions throughout the world and \r\ntheir implications in terms of human trafficking in \r\nparticular and of human rights in general. We therefore \r\nfirmly believe in the peaceful resolution of conflicts \r\nso as to help us combat trafficking and allow victims \r\nto recover their rights and ensure their well-being. \r\nMy country was one of the first to support the call \r\nfor action to end forced labour, modern slavery and \r\ntrafficking in persons. We remain committed to ending \r\nthat phenomenon.\r\nWe reiterate the importance of cooperation among \r\nMember States, agencies and the relevant authorities, in \r\nparticular the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees, the International Labour Organization, the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration and all other \r\nrelevant United Nations agencies. Such cooperation will \r\nallow us to respond rapidly to the challenges we face. \r\nCooperation in implementing the Global Plan of Action, \r\nincluding in collecting, analysing and sharing data, will \r\nenable States, non-governmental organizations and \r\ninternational agencies to share necessary information \r\nin a focused and timely manner, thereby enabling \r\nthe relevant authorities to respond effectively to the \r\nphenomenon of human trafficking, raising awareness \r\namong the public in general, facilitating the prosecution \r\nof the perpetrators of such crimes, and supporting the \r\nprocess of identifying victims.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nForeign Secretary of Maldives.\r\nMr. Sareer (Maldives): Let me express my \r\nappreciation to the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor convening this very crucial and timely meeting. \r\nThis is an important opportunity to generate further \r\npolitical momentum for the rapid implementation of the \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.\r\nIt is also timely against a backdrop where millions \r\nof people are moving across the globe in the hope of \r\nescaping poverty and conflict but are increasingly and \r\nunwillingly falling into the hands of smugglers and \r\ntraffickers. Trafficking in persons is an inhumane and \r\ncriminal activity that tears families apart and fuels \r\nviolence. It is a transnational organized crime that \r\ntargets the most vulnerable.\r\nDespite the inherently cruel nature of the crime, \r\nthe increased number of trafficking cases is alarming. \r\nThere are more than 500 trafficking f lows in operation \r\ntoday, moving men, women, and children within and \r\nacross borders. It is estimated that a disturbing 79 per \r\ncent of trafficking victims are women and children. \r\nWhen women and children are lured by promises of \r\ndecent employment, they are sexually exploited and \r\ntortured if they try to escape. This is modern slavery, \r\nand slavery should not be allowed in our modern \r\ncivilized world.\r\nIt is for that reason that we, as Member States, must \r\ndo more. The Government of President Abdulla Yameen \r\nAbdul Gayoom remains committed to the global fight \r\nto prevent trafficking in persons in line with the Global \r\nPlan of Action. Last year, the Maldives acceded to the \r\nProtocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking \r\nin Persons, especially Women and Children, in an effort \r\nto reinforce the implementation of existing instruments \r\nagainst trafficking in persons.\r\nAs required by the Anti-Trafficking Act of the \r\nMaldives enacted in 2013, an Oversight Committee \r\nhas been established to steer policy effectively and \r\nimplement legislation. In a further effort to address the \r\nissue comprehensively, the first National Action Plan to \r\nprevent trafficking in persons was formulated for the \r\nperiod 2015-2019. The Plan underscores the necessity \r\nof strengthening partnerships with the international \r\ncommunity in order to combat that crime.\r\nThe Government of Maldives is at present \r\nconducting new baseline studies in collaboration with \r\ninternational partners so that we can better understand \r\nthe problem. At the same time, we are strengthening \r\nour training programmes so that law-enforcement \r\nagencies are better equipped and can create the know-\r\nhow to better identify victims. We have also established \r\na mechanism to provide support and shelter for victims. \r\nAs a result of those efforts, the Maldives has achieved \r\nrecognition and recently gained more credibility under \r\ninternational benchmark-setting platforms.\r\nTrafficking in persons must be addressed in a \r\nmultidisciplinary and comprehensive manner. The \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 23/32\r\nGovernment of Maldives is in complete agreement \r\nthat the Global Action Plan and the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development should go hand in hand, \r\nand we recognize that the specific targets of the 2030 \r\nAgenda will help to implement the Global Action Plan \r\nmore rapidly and effectively. We are also of the view \r\nthat the menace of human trafficking can be eradicated \r\nonly if we, the Member States, join hands to strengthen \r\nour partnership coordination efforts.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Iceland.\r\nMr. Gunnarsson (Iceland): Iceland is pleased \r\nto participate in today’s meeting, as it gives us an \r\nopportunity to restate our firm commitment to the fight \r\nagainst human trafficking. It is a particularly cruel \r\ncrime to prey on those who cannot defend themselves \r\nand to separate them from their loved ones for the \r\npurpose of benefiting from their vulnerability.\r\nThe United Nations Global Plan of Action to \r\nCombat Trafficking in Person is a vital complement \r\nto the important legal standards of the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime, in \r\nparticular its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish \r\nTrafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. \r\nTogether those documents create a framework for our \r\njoint action to combat trafficking through prevention, \r\nprosecution, protection and partnerships.\r\nNo country in the world is immune to trafficking \r\nin human beings, and that includes my own country, \r\nIceland. That speaks to the importance of prevention \r\nas a key part of our efforts, responding to demands \r\nthat cannot be neglected. We also need to train our \r\npolice officers, airport staff and even f light attendants \r\nto recognize the signs of human trafficking in close \r\ncooperation with civil-society partners working on \r\nthat issue. Combating human trafficking requires the \r\nawareness of society as a whole if we are to effectively \r\naddress it.\r\nIt is also important to underline in this forum not \r\nonly cooperation on this topic but also the important \r\nrole that regional actors play in coordinating action. I \r\nwould here like to highlight the important work that the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\nis undertaking to address trafficking, both as a security \r\nthreat and as a human rights issue.\r\nLet us not forget the victims and survivors, who \r\nface multiple forms of discrimination owing to their \r\nstatus, hampering their ability to seek justice. In \r\nIceland we recently opened a one-stop shop offering \r\nfree comprehensive services for victims and survivors \r\nof abuse, including trafficking, bringing all actors \r\ntogether in support of those affected. We must seek \r\ninnovative ways to assist those who have been subjected \r\nto that heinous crime and ensure that their human rights \r\nare protected.\r\nTrafficking is a classic example of an issue that \r\nrequires cooperation across borders. Let us work across \r\nall barriers to eradicate that terrible crime.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Burkina Faso.\r\nMr. Tiare (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): \r\nBurkina Faso welcomes this high-level meeting of \r\nthe General Assembly and also welcomes yesterday’s \r\nadoption by consensus of the political declaration on \r\nthe Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons (resolution \r\n72/1).\r\nIn adopting the Global Plan of Action to \r\nCombat Trafficking in Persons on 12 August 2010, \r\nthe international community made promoting the \r\nuniversal ratification of the United Nations Convention \r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime one of its \r\nobjectives. That includes the additional Protocol to \r\nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, \r\nEspecially Women and Children, as well as the relevant \r\ninternational instruments related to human trafficking \r\nand the national, regional and international promotion \r\nof comprehensive, coherent and consistent action \r\nagainst that crime.\r\nBut where are we today, seven years after the \r\nadoption of this Global Plan of Action? That is an \r\nimportant question that needs to be asked, as the Plan \r\nmust be regularly assessed, so that we can identify its \r\nachievements, shortcomings and prospects in order to \r\nbetter fight trafficking in persons.\r\nStill today, human beings — particularly women \r\nand children — continue to be subjected to violence \r\nof all kinds throughout the world. That is the bitter \r\ntruth. Burkina Faso, considered a transit and transfer \r\ncountry, has not been spared the phenomenon of human \r\ntrafficking, and voted in 2008 — before the Global \r\nPlan of Action was even adopted in 2010 — to pass \r\na law in favour of fighting trafficking in persons and \r\nsimilar practices.\r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n24/32 17-30252\r\nWe also committed, alongside other States affected \r\nby that issue, to an agreement at the regional and \r\nsubregional levels in collaboration with international \r\norganizations with the aim of eradicating that form of \r\nmodern slavery. In addition to legislative and regulatory \r\nmeasures, the Government is undertaking a wide \r\nrange of awareness-raising activities to deter, unmask, \r\napprehend and prosecute those who seek to profit from \r\ntrafficking in their fellow human beings.\r\nSuch actions are being carried out by regional \r\nvigilance and surveillance committees throughout the \r\n13 regions and provincial oversight committees in the \r\n45 provinces. Those committees, composed of regional \r\nand provincial officials and community leaders, are \r\nresponsible for coordinating, monitoring and evaluating \r\nregional programmes and plans relating to the fight \r\nagainst trafficking in persons.\r\nEffective enforcement of human-trafficking \r\nlegislation is a major challenge to our efforts to end \r\ntrafficking in persons. That is why Burkina Faso \r\nremains convinced that no single country can win that \r\nfight alone — it requires a synergy of actions among \r\nStates in addition to existing national legislative and \r\nregulatory measures.\r\nIn that context, Burkina Faso welcomes the adoption \r\nof the political declaration and reiterates its readiness \r\nto work continuously with other Member States for the \r\nsuccessful implementation of the Global Plan of Action \r\nto Combat Trafficking in Persons.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Rwanda.\r\nMr. Rutikanga (Rwanda): I thank the President for \r\nconvening this important high-level meeting.\r\nIt is now seven years since the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 64/293, aptly entitled the United \r\nNations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons. It is therefore worth assembling today to \r\nreflect and, most important, appraise how far we have \r\nmoved in the implementation of the Global Plan of \r\nAction. Trafficking in persons is a kind of transnational \r\norganized crime. As it is, to a large extent, transnational \r\nin nature, it necessitates national, regional and global \r\nstrategies to combat, prevent and suppress it. Rwanda is \r\na State party to the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime and its subsequent \r\nProtocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking \r\nin Persons, Especially Women and Children.\r\nBuilding on those tools and guided by resolution \r\n72/1, which includes the political declaration on the \r\nImplementation of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons, which we \r\nadopted yesterday, we have the necessary framework \r\nand tools to effectively trace the human-trafficking \r\nlords. As the Secretary-General commented yesterday, \r\nwe have not yet imprisoned the human-trafficking \r\nlords. Likewise, we have not seen human-trafficking \r\nproceeds freeze. We should be able to cut the f lows of \r\nillicit money to those criminals. Unless we treat the \r\nbeneficiaries of that abominable crime as high-profile \r\ncriminals and develop legally binding instruments \r\nand effective mechanisms to track them, freeze and \r\nconfiscate theirs assets and hold them accountable for \r\ntheir crimes, we will not put an end to that heinous crime.\r\nOur experience shows that most of the victims are \r\nyoung people. They fall into the human-trafficking \r\ntrap by being deceived and promised decent jobs in \r\nthe countries of destination. Poverty, unemployment, \r\nmarginalization and many other issues that fuel the \r\nproblem have been mentioned. In that respect, we \r\nneed to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goal \r\ncommitments — to provide decent job opportunities, \r\nempower young people, enhance gender empowerment \r\nand create equal opportunities for all. That will \r\neffectively reduce people’s vulnerability to trafficking.\r\nIn Rwanda, we are cooperating with other Member \r\nStates in the region and beyond through special law-\r\nenforcement agencies, non-State organizations such \r\nas INTERPOL, and other United Nations organs on \r\nhow we can collectively combat that vice. In August \r\n2016, Rwanda law-enforcement agents, in partnership \r\nwith INTERPOL, conducted an assimilated exercise \r\nsession against transnational crimes such as terrorism, \r\nthe narcotics trade and human trafficking, in which 13 \r\ncountries from the region participated. The purpose \r\nof the exercise was to reach a harmonized level of \r\nunderstanding of the nature of human trafficking \r\nand forge a harmonized administrative procedure in \r\ncombating human trafficking.\r\nThe Rwanda National Police and Rwanda \r\nImmigration closely cooperate with their counterpart \r\ninstitutions in the region. Rwanda law-enforcement \r\nagents closely collaborate with the Uganda police and \r\nKenya police. As a result, between 2014 and 2016, 150 \r\nvictims were prevented from being trafficked.\r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 25/32\r\nMy country has initiated public-awareness \r\ncampaigns and programmes, and all relevant organs \r\nare cooperating to design outreach programmes. We \r\nhave also established a mechanism to protect victims, \r\nwitnesses and whistle-blowers. The Government \r\nestablished the Isange one-stop centre as a rehabilitation \r\ncentre for all victims of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation \r\nand gender-based violence, which helps the victims who \r\nhave been affected by the scourge of human trafficking.\r\nFinally, human trafficking is mostly transnational \r\nin nature. Along with the other bilateral arrangements \r\nthat exist among Member States to combat human \r\ntrafficking, we should not forget to make use of \r\nINTERPOL platforms and databases. INTERPOL \r\ntools, such as the I-24/7 system, certainly provide \r\ncritical information securely and in a short period \r\nof time.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Bangladesh.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): Human trafficking \r\npollutes our surroundings. Bangladesh welcomes \r\nthe adoption of the political declaration on the \r\nImplementation of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons (resolution \r\n72/1) on the appraisal of the Global Plan of Action \r\nto Combat Trafficking in Persons. We thank the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Belgium and Qatar for \r\naccommodating some of our concerns.\r\nIn today’s conflict situations, refugees and other \r\nforcibly displaced persons remain at a heightened \r\nrisk of trafficking and exploitation. Indeed, human \r\ntrafficking during conflicts, including by terrorists, \r\nhas emerged as one of the most serious human rights \r\nissues of our time.\r\nIn the last month, Bangladesh has witnessed an \r\nunprecedented influx of nearly 500,000 people — mostly \r\nRohingyas from Myanmar’s Rakhine state. We remain \r\nconcerned by the possibility of the large number \r\nof women and children in that group falling prey \r\nto traffickers and people-smugglers who operate \r\nregionally. In order to avoid a repeat of the Andaman \r\nSea crisis in 2015, we urge Myanmar to address the \r\nroot causes of the dire situation in Rakhine state and all \r\nregional countries to remain vigilant against organized \r\ncriminal networks and prevent them from taking \r\nadvantage of the dark humanitarian situation prevailing \r\nin the area.\r\nIn view of our situation, as a country of origin, transit \r\nand destination, our Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, \r\nmaintains a zero-tolerance approach to trafficking in \r\npersons and people smuggling. Bangladesh has enacted \r\nthe Human Trafficking Deterrence and Suppression Act \r\nof 2012 and has adopted a national plan of action for 2015 \r\nto 2017 to implement a comprehensive law. We remain \r\nfocused on further improving our prevention capacity \r\nthrough data collection, anti-trafficking information \r\ncampaigns with the help of non-governmental \r\norganization partnerships and with the prosecution and \r\nearly conclusion of trafficking cases.\r\nAt the regional level, we have spearheaded \r\ninitiatives to broaden and institutionalize the scope of \r\ncounter-trafficking operations under the South Asian \r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation and the Bay of \r\nBengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and \r\nEconomic Cooperation. Bangladesh remains active \r\nwithin the Group of Friends United against Human \r\nTrafficking and, during the General Assembly high-\r\nlevel week, joined the United Kingdom’s call to action \r\nto end forced labour, modern slavery and human \r\ntrafficking, pursuant to Sustainable Development Goal \r\ntarget 8.7.\r\nBangladesh also underscores the need for reducing \r\ncross-border trafficking f lows as part of the global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration. \r\nWe joined the New York Declaration for Refugees \r\nand Migrants in 2016 to that end. With regard to \r\nimplementing the Global Plan of Action, we urge the \r\nSecretary-General to enhance the profile, relevance and \r\nvisibility of the work of the Inter-Agency Coordination \r\nGroup against Trafficking in Persons for Member \r\nStates, including through the possibility of designating \r\na high-level focal person.\r\nThe Security Council’s political and humanitarian \r\nconsideration of specific conflict situations should \r\nbe informed by evidence on any emerging trend in \r\ntrafficking in persons and related crimes. The United \r\nNations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking \r\nin Persons needs to be supported in a sustained and \r\npredictable manner. Despite significant gains in the \r\nlegal sphere, the rate of prosecution and conviction \r\nstill remains relatively low around the world. We urge \r\nMember States to continue working on developing \r\neffective intelligence networks at the regional and \r\ninternational levels to monitor and intercept human \r\ntrafficking and related crimes, including illicit \r\nfinancial f lows.\r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n26/32 17-30252\r\nIn conclusion, Bangladesh reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to work together with Member States \r\nto further strengthen the United Nations coordinated \r\nresponse and action against trafficking in persons.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of China.\r\nMr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nTrafficking in persons is a significant problem at the \r\nglobal level from which no country is immune. China \r\nstrongly condemns trafficking in persons, especially \r\nwomen and children, and calls upon the international \r\ncommunity to focus its efforts on the following areas:\r\nFirst, it is essential to comprehensively implement \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\npromote economic and social development, work to \r\neradicate poverty, and uphold equity and justice in \r\norder to eliminate the breeding ground for the crime of \r\nhuman trafficking.\r\nSecondly, it is essential to establish and improve \r\nworking mechanisms that are led by Governments and \r\nensure the participation of the whole of society with a \r\nview to preventing and combating human trafficking \r\nand providing relief and rehabilitation to the victims, \r\nwith the goal of forming a well-functioning society-\r\nwide management setup.\r\nThirdly, it is essential to strengthen international \r\ncooperation in law enforcement, fully leverage the role \r\nof regional and subregional organizations, exchange \r\nintelligence and information in a timely manner, \r\neffectively conduct mutual assistance in criminal justice \r\nand severely punish perpetrators of human trafficking.\r\nFourthly, it is essential to effectively safeguard \r\nthe legitimate rights and interests of victims and work \r\nharder to provide them with rescue and relief, protection, \r\nrehabilitation and settlement, with the focus on helping \r\nthem get reintegrated into families and societies.\r\nAttaching great importance to combating human \r\ntrafficking, the Chinese Government has been working \r\nhard to implement the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress \r\nand Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women \r\nand Children, supplementing the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime. In \r\n2007 and 2013 respectively, the Chinese Government \r\npromulgated and started implementing the Plan of \r\nAction against Trafficking in Women and Children \r\nin China (2008-2012) and the Plan of Action against \r\nTrafficking in Persons in China (2013-2020). In 2009, \r\nin a bid to refine the existing working mechanism \r\nfeaturing Government leadership and broad-based \r\nsocial participation, an Interministerial Joint Meeting \r\nSystem for Combating Human Trafficking, consisting \r\nof 33 departments, was established under the State \r\nCouncil of China, thus providing a solid systemic \r\nguarantee for preventing and combating trafficking in \r\npersons and assisting and protecting the victims.\r\nCombating trafficking in persons is an urgent \r\ncommon task for the international community. China \r\nstands ready to work with other Member States and \r\nmake concerted efforts to comprehensively implement \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons (A/72/1), thus contributing to \r\nthe harmony and shared progress of humankind.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Iraq.\r\nMr. Al-Khaqani (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation thanks everyone who has contributed \r\nactively to the drawing up of the political declaration on \r\nthe Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons (resolution \r\n72/1).\r\nMember States managed to reach a consensus after \r\nlong deliberations on the paragraphs of the declaration, \r\nwhich are of great concern given the sensitive nature of \r\nthis subject for some countries affected by trafficking \r\nin persons. They are also of concern for other countries \r\nthat face terrorism and believe that that subject has \r\nbecome one of the tools used by terrorist organizations \r\nto achieve inhuman objectives.\r\nIraq has expressed its position on the need to \r\nindicate clearly in one of the paragraphs of the \r\ndeclaration the increasing relationship between \r\nterrorists and human trafficking. We have indicated \r\nthat the political declaration expresses the political will \r\nat the international level to combat intercontinental \r\nterrorism, which threatens secure societies. We \r\nhave also stressed the importance of banning human \r\ntrafficking and not allowing terrorist groups to take \r\nhostages from one country to another. It is therefore \r\na common responsibility. We must work together to \r\nfight that phenomenon. Trafficking in persons and \r\nother violations and abuses are committed by terrorists \r\nto enslave people and to exact servitude and sexual \r\nexploitation. Those are the methods that we see at work \r\nin the region.\r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 27/32\r\nIraq has suffered from such crimes, which are \r\nbeing committed by terrorist groups such as Da’esh. \r\nThose terrorist groups have kidnapped thousands \r\nof Iraqi citizens, in particular innocent women and \r\nchildren from among the Yazidis. They have been \r\nreduced to slaves and have been the subject of the worst \r\nforms of degrading and inhuman treatment. Given our \r\nresponsibilities to bring the perpetrators of the worst \r\ncrimes against the Iraqi people, my country, Iraq, to \r\njustice, working with its international partners, wrote a \r\nletter to the Secretary-General on 9 August 2017 asking \r\nfor international assistance. The Security Council also \r\nadopted resolution 2379 (2017), which called for the \r\ngathering of evidence, for reinforcing capacity-building \r\nand for ensuring the prosecution of Da’esh fighters.\r\nIraq has therefore made a crucial contribution \r\ntowards accountability and towards ensuring that \r\ncriminals are tried and justice provided to victims. \r\nWe call for Member States to implement the relevant \r\nresolutions, in particular Security Council resolution \r\n2195 (2014), in which the Council expressed its concern \r\nabout exploitation by terrorist groups, organized crime \r\ngroups and weapons traffickers.\r\nWe also call on all States to discharge their \r\ncommitment to strengthen their efforts to identify \r\ntrafficking operations and to stop them by any means \r\nnecessary. We call for people to fight that phenomenon \r\nthrough constructive cooperation between all countries \r\nat the political, economic and security levels. We are \r\ndealing with a global phenomenon. No country can \r\nfight it effectively if the international community does \r\nnot demonstrate its clear will to act together.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Jordan.\r\nMs. Bahous (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan welcomes the adoption \r\nof the political declaration on the Implementation of \r\nthe Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in \r\nPersons (resolution 72/1), following resolution 64/293, \r\nof 2010. It is a demonstration of the strong political \r\nwill on the part of the international community to take \r\naction and put an end to such heinous crimes. Such \r\nphenomena pose a threat to human beings and are \r\ngravely concerning for the international community, \r\nsince they constitute a violation of human dignity and \r\nfundamental human rights.\r\nFurthermore, recent terrorist groups have practiced \r\nvarious forms of modern slavery on a major scale and \r\nin a systematic manner. The worst kind of trafficking \r\nin persons affects the rights of people of all ethnic \r\ngroups and all religions. That is why the international \r\ncommunity must combat such phenomena effectively \r\nthrough all means possible. Trafficking in persons \r\nheightens conflicts, especially those of a religious and \r\nethnic nature. It also leads to violent reactions and a \r\nserious downward spiral of violence, against which the \r\ninternational community must fight.\r\nThe unprecedented waves of refugees throughout \r\nthe world have led to a large number of victims of \r\ntrafficking, according to the annual report of the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The \r\nincrease was seen primarily in countries experiencing \r\nconflicts, such as Syria, Iraq and Somalia, but also in \r\nEurope, Asia and other countries in the Middle East. \r\nThat is why we must reach political solutions in order \r\nto end all such conflicts and ensure that people are \r\ngiven back their dignity. Our duty as members of the \r\ninternational community is to address such phenomena \r\nfrom a global perspective and not to focus only on \r\nhotspots on the planet. We must also work at a regional \r\nlevel to counter such phenomena.\r\nInternational and interregional groups such as the \r\nHuman Security Network, of which Jordan is a member, \r\nplay an essential role when it comes to awareness-raising \r\nand cooperation. What we are dealing with is not just a \r\npolitical issue; trafficking also affects development. In \r\nthe framework of our efforts, we must take into account \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially \r\nwhen it comes to achieving SDG 16, aimed at promoting \r\npeaceful and inclusive societies for all, where human \r\nbeings are free from violence and fear.\r\nJordan believes that we can redouble our efforts \r\nto combat the smuggling of migrants, for which \r\nDa’esh is responsible in my particular region. We need \r\nnational, regional and international efforts to fight \r\nterrorism and extremism. Young men and women, as \r\nwell as women and children, need to become aware. \r\nWe also need to provide technical assistance to the \r\ncountries in need of such assistance in order to create \r\na global preventive strategy. We can never sufficiently \r\nemphasize the linkage between trafficking, on the one \r\nhand, and terrorism and extremism, on the other. We \r\nmust cooperate in the exchange of information and \r\ncapacity-building with the assistance of international \r\ninstitutions, in particular UNODC, which plays an \r\nessential role in that area.\r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n28/32 17-30252\r\nParticular importance is attached to rehabilitating \r\nvictims who have been forced to rebuild their lives. \r\nIn that regard, we must also give special attention to \r\nwomen and children. Trafficking is a crime under \r\nthe Jordanian criminal court code. We ratified the \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime \r\nand its protocols, adopted in Palermo, Italy, to put an \r\nend to contemporary slavery and trafficking in persons.\r\nWe are working to expose all forms of trafficking \r\nin persons by establishing a national commission with a \r\nview to bringing together representatives of the various \r\nministries and competent authorities. We have also \r\nformed a unit against human trafficking, so that the \r\nlegal system can implement the strategy established \r\nin 2010-2012, which makes it possible to bolster the \r\ncapacity of judges and enables victims to recover their \r\nrights, especially victims of forced labour.\r\nWe have, furthermore, created a national \r\ncommission against trafficking in persons with a \r\nhotline number, which makes it possible for victims \r\nto reach the authorities in the event of abuse. We have \r\na national mechanism that makes it possible to bring \r\nall cases of trafficking to justice, as well as to provide \r\nshelters for victims. Additionally, we have a national \r\nstrategy until 2025 that makes it possible to reinforce \r\nour actions towards the attainment of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Furthermore, we have created a \r\nrehabilitation centre, which we have named the “House \r\nof Dignity”. It is under the auspices of the Ministry of \r\nSocial Services.\r\nWe are also coordinating the efforts of our national \r\nauthorities, in cooperation with the United Nations \r\nagencies and non-governmental organizations, to \r\nrespond to the particular needs of Syrian refugees and \r\ntheir children with a view to providing them with all \r\nof the social and psychological support they need, with \r\nthe assistance of UNICEF. We will continue our efforts \r\nto counter trafficking in persons, especially the crimes \r\ncommitted by terrorist organizations. We are willing to \r\ncooperate with all regional and international authorities \r\nin order to put a stop to such phenomena and to respond \r\nto their consequences, as well as to prevent them.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Kuwait.\r\nMr. Almunaikh (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nMy delegation would like to welcome the political \r\ndeclaration on the Implementation of the United \r\nNations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons (resolution 72/1), adopted by the General \r\nAssembly yesterday morning. My delegation would \r\nlike to express its deep thanks and appreciation to the \r\nPermanent Representatives of our brother countries of \r\nQatar and Belgium for their efforts as co-facilitators of \r\nthe political declaration. Their efforts helped us reach a \r\nconsensus on the text.\r\nTrafficking in persons has become a growing \r\nconcern for humankind at large in recent times. It is \r\na form of modern slavery and a f lagrant violation of \r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms. Trafficking \r\nin persons is an international phenomenon. It knows \r\nno specific country. It crosses borders and reaches new \r\ncountries. It takes various forms and displays various \r\npatterns. The perceptions of States with regard to the \r\nnotion of trafficking in persons differ according to the \r\nlevel of respect for human rights, customs, traditions, \r\nculture, criminal legislation and the political regime of \r\nthe country.\r\nThe State of Kuwait believes in identifying the \r\nroot causes behind the increase in the phenomenon of \r\ntrafficking in persons, which include a number of social, \r\neconomic, cultural, political and other factors. Such \r\nfactors make people vulnerable to trafficking, as they \r\ninclude poverty, unemployment, inequality, conflicts, \r\ndisasters, sexual violence, gender discrimination, \r\nsocial exclusion and marginalization.\r\nMy delegation stresses that Kuwait is committed to \r\npromoting and protecting human rights and continuing \r\nthe fight against trafficking in persons. Here I would \r\nlike to highlight briefly the actions and procedures \r\nundertaken by Kuwait, including the enactment of \r\nlegislation, that demonstrate our steadfast will to \r\nfight such crime and deter the ill-intended people who \r\nare involved in perpetuating crimes of trafficking \r\nin persons.\r\nFirst, Law No. 109 of 2013 provides for the \r\nestablishment of the National Labour Force Agency, \r\nwhich is tasked with drafting rules and regulations \r\nguaranteeing the rights of migrant workers. Secondly, \r\nwe are setting up temporary shelters for workers in line \r\nwith the international conventions ratified by Kuwait. \r\nThat action aims at providing the protection and full \r\ncare of workers, as well as at helping them return to \r\ntheir countries.\r\nThirdly, we are implementing the 2013 Act on \r\ncombating trafficking in persons and the smuggling \r\nof workers. It is a new step for us to uphold the rights \r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 29/32\r\nof migrant workers, whether in the international or \r\ndomestic sectors. The law includes severe punishment \r\nof up to 15 years of imprisonment for those who are \r\nproved to be involved in the commission of such \r\ncrimes. The reason for those measures is to ensure that \r\ntraffickers do not enjoy impunity.\r\nFourthly, regarding the 2015 regulation on fighting \r\ncybercrimes, clause 8 of that legislation makes \r\ncriminally liable any person who creates a website or \r\nspreads information by using the Internet or any other \r\nmeans of information communication technology for \r\nthe purpose of trafficking in persons or facilitating \r\ntheir exploitation.\r\nMy country’s efforts are in line with the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, in particular \r\nSustainable Development Goals 5, 8 and 12. \r\nFurthermore, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on \r\ntrafficking in persons, especially women and children, \r\nvisited Kuwait upon an invitation from the State in \r\n2016 to assess the situation and our institutional and \r\nlegislative framework. In her report of 14 September \r\n2016, which she presented at the thirty-fifth session of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, she stressed that Kuwait \r\nhas proved its commitment to fighting trafficking in \r\npersons and that Kuwait was a model to be followed \r\nin the region and beyond. She further commended our \r\ninstitutional and legal framework in the area of labour, \r\nthe private sector, domestic service and child labour.\r\nRecently, my country joined the International \r\nMigration Organization (IMO) as an observer. My \r\ncountry believes in the role of the IMO in fighting all \r\nforms of trafficking in persons. Kuwait effectively \r\ncooperates with the IMO to fight that phenomenon by \r\nholding educational and awareness-raising seminars on \r\nthe matter.\r\nConcurrent with our meeting today, the \r\nGovernment of Kuwait is considering the adoption of \r\na national strategy to fight trafficking in persons and \r\nthe smuggling of migrants, with representation from \r\nministries and various other sectors. The strategy is \r\nbased on three pillars, namely, prevention, protection \r\nand partnerships, in addition to cooperation at the local \r\nand regional levels. In conclusion, we must underscore \r\nthat despite all international efforts to address the \r\nphenomenon, it remains a paramount challenge \r\nthat requires increased concerted efforts from the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\r\nMs. King (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines welcomes the adoption \r\nof the political declaration on the Implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons (resolution 72/1), and we \r\nappreciate this opportunity to share some of what we \r\nare doing to combat human trafficking.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines established \r\nan anti-trafficking-in-persons unit in 2012. That \r\nunit carries out many activities, which include the \r\nsensitization of more than 30,000 students and over \r\n3,000 teachers, in a population of 110,000 people; the \r\nsensitization of key stakeholders, such as churches, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and law enforcement; \r\nmedia outreach; and the investigation of more than 10 \r\npotential cases of human trafficking, with one arrest \r\nmade in 2015.\r\nWe have strengthened our legislative framework to \r\ncombat human trafficking. We have ratified the United \r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and \r\nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \r\nChildren (resolution 55/25). There is coordination across \r\nministries and departments to ensure that we adhere to \r\nthat and other international plans aimed at combating \r\nhuman trafficking. Our Parliament has recently \r\nrevised the Immigration Restriction Act to criminalize \r\nthe smuggling of migrants. That amendment will \r\ncomplement the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons \r\nAct of 2011.\r\nIn February, using technical assistance received \r\nthrough the Partnership Agreement between the \r\nmembers of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group \r\nof States on the one hand, and the European Community \r\nand its member States, on the other hand, and the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration, we made \r\nfurther progress in the form of a revised national plan of \r\naction to combat trafficking in persons and formulated \r\na data-gathering tool on trafficking in persons.\r\nThere is need for coordination internationally. \r\nThrough bilateral cooperation, Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines has been a part of rescue operations for \r\nsome of its own citizens who have been trafficked \r\nabroad. No country is immune to human trafficking, and \r\nwe are doing our utmost to fight any sign of infection. \r\nWe believe that one case of human trafficking on our \r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n30/32 17-30252\r\nshores is one case too many, and we will continue to use \r\nall tools at our disposal to close all potential avenues for \r\ntraffickers. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines remains \r\ndeeply committed to the fight against trafficking in \r\npersons and expresses solidarity with the victims and \r\nsurvivors of such heinous crimes.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Spain.\r\nMs. Bassols Delgado (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nSpain aligns itself with the political statement \r\nmade yesterday on this topic by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union.\r\nI would like to begin by thanking the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for convening this high-level \r\nmeeting devoted to the appraisal of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \r\nand for giving greater visibility to that international \r\nscourge. We are also grateful to the facilitators and the \r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for their \r\nwork during the negotiations on the recent adoption \r\nof the Political Declaration on the Implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons (resolution 72/1).\r\nIn the interest of time, I will focus my statement on \r\nfive very specific points. First, trafficking in persons \r\nconstitutes one of the most fundamental attacks on \r\nhuman rights, affecting women, children and men. \r\nTrafficking also entails clandestine activity, about \r\nwhich there is limited information or knowledge. \r\nFurthermore, it is the result of very complex worldwide \r\nproblems involving social, economic, health, political \r\nand legal factors. If we therefore want our appraisal \r\nexercises to have an effect, we will have to address the \r\nphenomenon of trafficking comprehensively.\r\nSecondly, the work of the Inter-Agency \r\nCoordination Group against Trafficking in Persons \r\nmust be revitalized so that we can make progress in \r\nreaching the Sustainable Development Goals related to \r\ncombating trafficking, as well as in dealing with all of \r\nthe aspects related to prevention, impunity and victims’ \r\nneeds. Cooperation among of all the relevant bodies is, \r\ntherefore, crucial.\r\nThirdly, trafficking requires a specific response \r\nwhen it occurs in the context of conflict situations, \r\nbecause, in such cases, the national criminal justice \r\nsystem is affected. Security Council resolution 2331 \r\n(2016), which was sponsored by Spain, calls for the \r\ntaking of measures by a number of United Nations \r\nbodies, Member States and other stakeholders that can \r\nhelp advance efforts to combat trafficking in persons in \r\nconflict-affected areas. That resolution highlighted the \r\nundoubtedly perverse relationship linking trafficking, \r\nsexual violence in conflict, organized crime and \r\nterrorist funding. In that vein, we welcome the recent \r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 2379 (2017), \r\nbecause we believe that it will truly help efforts to hold \r\nthose responsible for the crimes committed by Da’esh \r\nin Iraq accountable.\r\nFourthly, Spain believes that we must redouble our \r\nnational efforts. The existing relevant conventions and \r\nprotocols must be complemented with an exchange of \r\nviews on our best practices and national policies. Last \r\nweek in this very Hall, the Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Spain proposed establishing an international network \r\nof anti-trafficking coordinators (see A/72/PV.14).\r\nFifthly, I would like to highlight the fact that Spain is \r\ndeveloping a firm and comprehensive policy to combat \r\ntrafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal \r\nand trafficking in human organs. Upon the initiative of \r\nSpain and Guatemala, the General Assembly recently \r\nadopted resolution 71/322, which is aimed at promoting \r\norgan donations and transplant systems that follow \r\nclinical, ethical and altruistic criteria. Spain has been \r\nvery successful in that area, and we are ready and \r\nwilling to share our experience with everyone.\r\nLastly, I would be remiss if I concluded without \r\npledging to continue our firm commitment and efforts \r\nin the Human Rights Council aimed at combating \r\ntrafficking in persons, should we be elected to that body \r\non 16 October. We are also determined to work closely \r\nwith the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and \r\nthe other relevant bodies of the United Nations system \r\nthat are engaged in combating — in our view — one of \r\nthe major scourges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 49/2, of 19 October 1994, I now \r\ncall on the observer for the International Federation of \r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\r\nMr. Valastro (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): It is my pleasure to \r\ntake the f loor on behalf of the International Federation \r\nof Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies representing \r\nthe world’s 190 national societies and their 13 million \r\ncommunity-based volunteers.\r\n28/09/2017 A/72/PV.26\r\n17-30252 31/32\r\nAs a first principle, when it comes to confronting \r\ntrafficking, we should set as our primary goal doing \r\nwhat we can to prevent trafficking from occurring, \r\nas well as protecting and supporting those at risk. \r\nOur organization welcomes the fact that the political \r\ndeclaration on the Implementation of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons \r\n(resolution 72/1) reaffirms the commitments contained \r\nin the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nrelating to combating all forms of trafficking in persons. \r\nWe note, as well, that the political declaration refers to \r\nthe New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, \r\nwhich recognizes that refugees and migrants in large \r\nmovements are at greater risk of being trafficked. It is \r\nour hope that the eventual adoption of a global compact \r\non migration will provide the opportunity to find \r\nagreement on basic principles after decades of work.\r\nLet me offer a few examples from within our \r\nnetwork. The British and Australian Red Cross \r\nSocieties operate programmes where people who \r\nhave experienced trafficking are provided with \r\naccommodations, material support and a caseworker. \r\nThe goal is to provide assistance addressing the unique \r\nvulnerabilities and risk factors of those who have been \r\ntrafficked, and give them the time and support needed \r\nto decide the subsequent steps they would like to take. \r\nHowever, offering such services is worth little if the \r\npeople whom we seek to help are too afraid to reach out \r\nto us. Supporting them means ensuring safe channels \r\nto access basic services and report abuse, irrespective \r\nof the legal status of such migrants. In particular, we \r\ncall on States to ensure that vulnerable migrants have \r\nsafe and confidential access to such support, without \r\nobliging them to choose specific service providers or \r\ndisclose their legal status.\r\nSecondly, we must keep our eyes wide open with \r\nregard to signs suggesting trafficking. Along any \r\nmigratory trail, officials and organizations must actively \r\nbe on the lookout for potential indicators of trafficking. \r\nStates should also ensure that any person who has \r\nexperienced trafficking or is at risk of exploitation is \r\nsafely identified and referred to the appropriate sources \r\nof humanitarian support and assistance. It is only by \r\nworking together, from cross-border collaboration to \r\nthe provision of humanitarian support for those who \r\nhave been trafficked and addressing the systemic \r\ndrivers of trafficking and labour exploitation, that \r\nwe can end trafficking. Most importantly, we must \r\nwork with those who have experienced trafficking to \r\nunderstand those driving factors, how to protect the \r\nmost vulnerable and how we can assist those who have \r\nexperienced trafficking or exploitation so that they can \r\nrebuild their lives.\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor to \r\nthe delegation that wishes to speak in exercise of the \r\nright of reply, may I remind members that statements \r\nin the exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 \r\nminutes for the first intervention and to five minutes \r\nfor the second intervention, and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nRussian Federation.\r\nMrs. Mozolina (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): We will try to be brief. We would have \r\npreferred not to respond to the statement made \r\nby the representative of the Ukrainian delegation. \r\nNevertheless, we believe that we need to respond to the \r\nattacks that were addressed to us in a statement.\r\nWe should bear in mind that, since the beginning \r\nof the 1990s, Ukraine has consistently performed \r\npoorly in terms of forced labour and human trafficking. \r\nAccording to data from the International Organization \r\nfor Migration, Ukraine is one of the largest providers of \r\nslave labour in Europe. Since 1991, 160,000 Ukrainians \r\nhave been victims of human trafficking. Of course, \r\ngiven the domestic armed conflict, for which the \r\nresponsibility lies with the authorities in Kyiv, the \r\nsituation has become particularly threatening.\r\nI will now provide some other facts. The \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\nSpecial Monitoring Mission to Ukraine has repeatedly \r\nstated that Ukrainian displaced persons are particularly \r\nvulnerable to exploitation and human trafficking. First \r\nand foremost that is because of economic difficulties \r\ncaused by Kyiv’s actions. The Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights has also \r\nprovided information in his report on the human rights \r\nsituation in Ukraine, including facts about women who \r\nwere forced into prostitution with Ukrainian soldiers to \r\nensure the survival of their families.\r\nWe encourage the Ukrainian authorities to consider \r\nonce again that the introduction of a transport blockade \r\nin the south-east of the country and stopping social \r\nwelfare benefit payments in that region has allowed \r\ncrime-related business to f lourish in the area, making \r\nthose sections of the Ukrainian population the group \r\nA/72/PV.26 28/09/2017\r\n32/32 17-30252\r\nmost vulnerable to human trafficking. Unfortunately, \r\nhowever, the Ukrainian delegation prefers to identify \r\nthose outside of its borders, particularly in Russia, \r\nas the guilty party, rather than seeking genuine \r\nsolutions to those very serious issues and participating \r\nin a substantive and constructive discussion in the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
