"United Nations A/72/PV.27\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n27th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 2 October 2017, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Tevi (Vanuatu), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 107 (continued)\r\nCrime prevention and criminal justice\r\nHigh-level meeting of the General Assembly on \r\nthe appraisal of the United Nations Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons\r\nThe Acting President: Before we proceed, I would \r\nlike to remind all speakers to limit their statements to \r\nthree minutes when speaking in their national capacity, \r\nas stipulated in resolution 71/287. As members will \r\nrecall, in its resolution 71/323, of 8 September 2017, the \r\nGeneral Assembly called for strict adherence by each \r\nspeaker to the time limits in the Assembly, particularly \r\nduring high-level meetings. This will enable maximum \r\nparticipation within the limited time available for \r\nthe meeting. Participants with longer statements are \r\nencouraged to read a shorter version of their text and \r\nto submit their full statements to the Secretariat for \r\nposting on the PaperSmart portal.\r\nAlso in accordance with resolution 71/323, the “all \r\nprotocol observed” principle, whereby participants are \r\nencouraged, in the interest of saving time, to refrain \r\nfrom the listing of standard protocol expressions during \r\ntheir statements, is recommended. In the light of the \r\ngiven time frame, I would like to appeal to speakers \r\nto deliver their statements at a normal speed so that \r\ninterpretation may be provided properly. To assist \r\nspeakers in managing their time, a light system has \r\nbeen installed at the speaker’s rostrum. May I appeal to \r\nall speakers for their cooperation in observing the time \r\nlimit of their statements, so that all those inscribed can \r\nbe heard in a timely manner.\r\nI now give the f loor to the deputy Chair of the \r\ndelegation of Ethiopia.\r\nMs. Hailu (Ethiopia): I would like to start by \r\nthanking the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening this high-level meeting on an important issue. \r\nEthiopia welcomes the Assembly’s unanimous adoption \r\nof the political declaration on the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons (resolution 72/1).\r\nPoverty, climate change, the level of development \r\namong States and societies, different standards of \r\nliving, the income inequality that prevails in many \r\ncountries, as well as conflict, are all factors that increase \r\nthe vulnerability of people to human trafficking. For \r\ninstance, migrants who cross international borders in \r\nsearch of a better life may become victims of human-\r\ntrafficking and smuggling networks. Similarly, \r\nrefugees who already find themselves in a vulnerable \r\nsituation due to a lack of durable solutions, including \r\nthose who engage in secondary movements, become \r\nprey to traffickers and smugglers.\r\nVictims of trafficking continue to face unimaginable \r\nand often fatal dangers along their journeys, owing to \r\nthe limited opportunities for legal migration and durable \r\nsolutions. They continue to face various human rights \r\nviolations, including violations of their labour rights \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

All of these challenges require \r\na comprehensive and holistic response that could be \r\nbased on the three following pillars.\r\nThe first would address the root causes of trafficking \r\nin persons, such as poverty, unemployment and conflict. \r\nThis approach requires States to take concrete steps \r\nto design and implement projects tailored to specific \r\ncommunities affected by trafficking in persons, \r\ncontributing to their economic and social development \r\nand involving relevant development actors. As refugees \r\nare the group most vulnerable to trafficking in persons, \r\nthis approach also requires us to find durable solutions \r\nto their particular situations. That could be achieved by \r\nenhancing support to countries hosting large numbers \r\nof refugees, based on the principles of international \r\ncooperation and responsibility sharing, and by \r\nstrengthening the capacity of refugee camps to offer \r\nskills training and income-generating activities.\r\nThe second pillar would create interim frameworks \r\nfor international protection, humanitarian assistance \r\nand efforts to address the needs of victims of \r\ntrafficking. As such, the provision of lifesaving \r\nhumanitarian assistance and basic necessities to \r\nvictims of trafficking in countries of transit and \r\ndestination is critical. In this context, maintaining the \r\ncapacity to respond to humanitarian emergencies and \r\nstrengthening international assistance to victims of \r\ntrafficking remains central.\r\nThe third pillar would create safe, orderly and \r\nlegal pathways by adopting a rights-based approach \r\nthat ensures the protection of victims of trafficking \r\nin persons in transit and destination countries. This \r\napproach would require stronger cooperation among \r\nMember States, as underscored by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his opening statement on Wednesday (see \r\nA/72/PV.24).\r\nWe can build on existing multilateral and bilateral \r\nframeworks, including within the context of the United \r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish \r\nTrafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, \r\nand on resolution 72/1, in order to foster enhanced \r\ncooperation in preventing and suppressing trafficking \r\nin persons, bring perpetrators to justice and provide \r\nsupport to victims. Building on existing frameworks to \r\naddress trafficking in persons, including through the \r\npolitical declaration adopted on Wednesday, will also \r\nbe necessary if we are to fill gaps in the global compact \r\nfor safe, orderly and regular migration expected to be \r\nadopted next year.\r\nIn our view, these three pillars will enable the \r\ninternational community to respond to trafficking \r\nin persons in a comprehensive and holistic manner. \r\nI would therefore like to conclude by reaffirming \r\nour commitment to redoubling our efforts aimed \r\nat combating trafficking in persons based on these \r\nthree pillars and within the context of resolution 72/1 \r\nand our obligations under various multilateral and \r\nbilateral frameworks.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of the Republic of Uzbekistan.\r\nMr. Ibragimov (Uzbekistan): I would first like to \r\ncommend the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening this important and timely high-level meeting.\r\nIn today’s world, human trafficking is one of the \r\nmost dangerous types of transnational organized \r\ncrime. It continues to remain a serious challenge for \r\nthe entire international community. In Uzbekistan, we \r\nare addressing this phenomenon at the State level. For \r\nexample, in 2008, in order to take effective measures \r\nto prevent and combat human trafficking, we adopted a \r\nnational law on countering human trafficking. Pursuant \r\nto this legislation, our President signed a decree on \r\nmeasures to improve the effectiveness of our efforts to \r\ncombat human trafficking.\r\nTo assist in coordinating the activities of the \r\ndepartments involved in the fight against human \r\ntrafficking, we created a national inter-agency \r\ncommission on combating human trafficking, consisting \r\nof our Heads of State and Government, agencies and \r\npublic organizations, ministries and departments, a \r\nwomen’s committee, our national centre for human \r\nrights, a parliamentary commissioner for human rights \r\nor ombudsman, representatives of our youth union and a \r\nnumber of other non-governmental organizations. Our \r\nProsecutor-General chairs the commission, since the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor-General has been assigned the \r\ntask of coordinating the activities of relevant agencies \r\nin the fight against human trafficking.\r\nIn the framework of implementing Uzbekistan’s law \r\non countering human trafficking, the Cabinet adopted \r\na decree in 2008 forming a national rehabilitation \r\ncentre for assisting and protecting victims of human \r\ntrafficking, which now plays an important role in \r\n02/10/2017 A/72/PV.27\r\n17-30366 3/10\r\nassisting victims of human trafficking in their return \r\nto normal life.\r\nIllegal migration has recently become another acute \r\nglobal problem associated with human trafficking, \r\nFrom Uzbekistan’s perspective, an effective way to \r\nprevent illegal migration for overseas employment is to \r\nincrease citizens’ awareness of potential difficulties in \r\nmigration by explaining accountability for violations of \r\nthe labour, tax, customs, passport and visa regulations \r\nof the countries where potential victims plan to reside. \r\nWe have also launched a wide-ranging media campaign \r\nto increase public awareness not only of the dangers \r\nof human trafficking but also of the specific effects of \r\ncrimes related to human trafficking and their negative \r\nconsequences. In cases of the illegal exploitation of \r\npersons for labour purposes, for example, criminal \r\nproceedings are instituted against the individuals \r\ndirectly involved in this form of human trafficking. \r\nIn addition, Uzbekistan is a signatory to major \r\ninternational conventions on combating illegal human \r\ntrafficking, protecting its victims and punishing those \r\nwho are involved in this criminal activity.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that \r\nthe Government of Uzbekistan has been consistent \r\nin its approach to combating human trafficking. We \r\ntherefore remain committed to cooperating with \r\nthe United Nations, the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development, the International \r\nLabour Organization and other international structures \r\nand parties through active participation in joint projects \r\naimed at preventing human trafficking and protecting \r\nits victims.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChair of the delegation of Belize.\r\nMs. Young (Belize): I would like to begin by \r\nexpressing my delegation’s deep appreciation to \r\nMs. Grizelda Grootboom, whose strength and courage \r\nin standing before the world and sharing a story that \r\nshe would no doubt rather banish from than burnish \r\nin her memory is unfathomable (see A/72/PV.24). \r\nBut her story must be told, lest we forget that human \r\nbeings no different from any of us in this Hall and no \r\ndifferent from our own children are today being made \r\nto suffer the most intolerable indignity and inhumanity, \r\nsomething that should have been consigned to history \r\nwhen slavery was abolished more than a century and a \r\nhalf ago. Grizelda’s story tells us of a human being’s \r\ninherent vulnerability and society’s blind eye. It tells \r\nus of how our failure to act all but perpetuates the \r\nimpunity of traffickers and exploiters.\r\nIn Belize, we have a low incidence of cases of \r\nhuman trafficking but high incidences of human \r\nsmuggling and commercial sex work, both of which \r\npromote vulnerability. For this reason, we have adopted \r\nlegislation and a national plan of action to combat \r\ntrafficking. Our national approach is multi-pronged \r\nand victim-centric, focusing first on prevention and \r\ncapacity-building, on understanding the context in \r\nwhich trafficking occurs or might occur, and on how \r\nto prevent it through education and public awareness. \r\nSecondly, it focuses on how to protect victims and \r\nensure their safety, and thirdly, on prosecution and how \r\nto ensure that justice is served. Fourthly, it focuses on \r\npartnerships and how to optimize our efforts through \r\nlocal, regional and international partnerships. Through \r\nincreased cooperation, Belize hopes to complement \r\nthese efforts with long-term assistance for victims, \r\nadvanced training for investigators, the establishment \r\nof specialized investigative units and dedicated \r\nprosecutors and judges, and the implementation of a \r\nfast-track system for human-trafficking cases.\r\nAll of us here today are committed to combating \r\ntrafficking, but we have not done enough. There are \r\ntens of millions of victims whose stories have yet to be \r\ntold, which is a blight on humankind and an indictment \r\nof us all. I stand here to add my country’s voice to \r\nthose of all victims and survivors. Belize reaffirms its \r\nunwavering commitment to the United Nations Global \r\nPlan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons. We \r\nfully support the adoption of the political declaration \r\n(resolution 72/1), which strengthens our resolve to \r\nvanquish this form of modern-day slavery once and \r\nfor all.\r\nTo echo Grizelda’s words, we cannot act on paper \r\nalone; human trafficking must be a real priority. We \r\nmust match our resolve by delivering equally on the \r\nnecessary resources and the widest cooperation at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels. For Belize, \r\ncombating trafficking is an absolute moral necessity, \r\nand we will make every effort to triumph over this \r\nheinous crime.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nthe Chair of the delegation of the Federal Democratic \r\nRepublic of Nepal.\r\nMr. Bhattarai (Nepal): My delegation commends \r\nand appreciates the initiative of the President of the \r\nA/72/PV.27 02/10/2017\r\n4/10 17-30366\r\nGeneral Assembly in convening this high-level meeting \r\non the appraisal of the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons. We believe \r\nthat the political declaration that we adopted late \r\nlast week (resolution 72/1) should provide renewed \r\nmomentum for translating the Global Plan of Action \r\ninto reality without delay.\r\nThe heinous crime of human trafficking continues \r\nto taint our civilizations. No country — large or small, \r\nrich or poor, whether of origin, transit or destination — is \r\nimmune to what has now grown to be a global menace. \r\nPoverty, discrimination, disasters, false dreams of \r\nsuccess, empty promises made by unscrupulous \r\noperators, and forced migratory movements, among \r\nother things, are increasingly making it worse. \r\nThousands of young boys and girls in our country, \r\nespecially those from rural Nepal, seeking jobs in cities \r\nand foreign countries, are prone to trafficking. Heart-\r\nwrenching stories of young women and girls being \r\ntrafficked abound, owing mainly to poverty, ignorance \r\nand temptation on their part, as well as inhuman greed \r\non the part of traffickers.\r\nNepal has put in place strong legal and institutional \r\nmeasures at the national level to curb such crimes. \r\nOur efforts to address the root causes of human \r\ntrafficking are focused on the principles of prevention, \r\nprotection, prosecution and partnership, with due \r\nattention being paid to both the push and pull factors \r\nof human trafficking. The Constitution of Nepal of \r\n2015 guarantees the right to be free from exploitation \r\nand bars human trafficking, forced and bonded labour. \r\nThese serious crimes are punishable under the laws of \r\nNepal. The Constitution also ensures legal remedies \r\nand compensation for the victims of slavery, bonded \r\nlabour, trafficking and child labour.\r\nBack in 2000, Nepal was the first country in South \r\nAsia to launch a national plan of action against trafficking \r\nin women and children. At the regional level, Nepal is \r\na party to the South Asian Association for Regional \r\nCooperation Convention on Preventing and Combating \r\nTrafficking in Women and Children. At the global level, \r\nNepal is a State party to 24 international human rights \r\nconventions, including seven of eight fundamental \r\nInternational Labour Organization conventions, most \r\nimportantly those relating to protection of the victims \r\nof slavery and human trafficking.\r\nI want to conclude by underscoring three specific \r\npoints as part of our way forward in implementing the \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.\r\nFirst, all Governments, international organizations, \r\nbusinesses and academic and philanthropic organizations \r\nshould join hands to fight this multidimensional crime, \r\nfocusing on its root causes. Nepal has a number of \r\ndedicated and credible institutions that can do much \r\nmore if their capacity is strengthened further. The fact \r\nis that capacity-building at the local and national level \r\nis urgent and critical.\r\nSecondly, the growing use of social media to tempt \r\nunsuspecting men, women and children into being \r\ntrafficked should be dealt with head on. To do this \r\nand to curb tech-savvy traffickers, we should put in \r\nplace additional security measures, including capacity-\r\nbuilding and real-time information-sharing. Partnership \r\nthat helps to build capacity is a must in that regard.\r\nThirdly, as was underlined by Nepal at the recent \r\nhigh-level meetings, the importance of investing in \r\neducation and raising people’s awareness should come \r\ninto sharp focus through our concerted efforts in \r\npartnership with United Nations agencies and civil-\r\nsociety organizations. Increased engagement on the \r\npart of communities, local health workers, teachers and \r\nmothers’ groups, among others, is an absolute necessity \r\nif we are to prevent these crimes, bring perpetrators to \r\njustice and ensure that the victims are compensated and \r\nreintegrated with dignity so that they can become fully \r\nproductive members of society. All of these efforts \r\nwill directly contribute to attaining the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals within the stipulated time frame.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 48/265 of 24 August 1994, I call \r\non the observer for the Sovereign Order of Malta.\r\nMr. De Rojas (Sovereign Order of Malta): I am \r\ndelivering this statement on behalf of our Ambassador-\r\nat-Large for Monitoring and Combating Trafficking in \r\nPersons, Ambassador Michel Veuthey, who was here all \r\nof last week. He was supposed to speak on Thursday, \r\nbut unfortunately had to return to our headquarters.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe Sovereign Order of Malta would like to thank \r\nthe President for giving us the opportunity to speak at \r\nthis high-level meeting on such a major issue. Since \r\nits founding 900 years ago, the mission of the Order \r\nof Malta, a sovereign entity in public international \r\n02/10/2017 A/72/PV.27\r\n17-30366 5/10\r\nlaw, has been to help vulnerable people. The Order of \r\nMalta now supports more than 2,000 medical, social \r\nand humanitarian projects in more than 120 countries, \r\nregardless of religion, ethnicity or nationality. We \r\nreaffirm the commitment of the Order of Malta to \r\nhelping reduce the vulnerability of migrants and \r\nrefugees and to protecting them, particularly victims of \r\nhuman trafficking.\r\nThe Order of Malta will strengthen its efforts \r\nby using its diplomatic network, both multilaterally \r\nand bilaterally, through its Ambassadors in 106 \r\ncountries. In addition, we will increase the social \r\nservices and humanitarian actions of our national \r\nassociations and our global humanitarian organization, \r\nMalteser International.\r\nThe Order of Malta will continue to listen to other \r\nactors and learn from their best practices. We are open \r\nto cooperating with Governments and civil society \r\nto help better protect and rehabilitate the victims of \r\ncontemporary slavery.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to ask the following \r\nthree questions. First, how can we better use the values \r\nof solidarity and respect for human life to strengthen \r\nthe legal instruments of national and international \r\nlaw — human rights, labour law, refugee law and the \r\ninternational humanitarian law applicable in armed \r\nconflicts, in order to end human trafficking? Secondly, \r\nhow can we better highlight and share the contribution \r\nof faith-based organizations that protect and assist \r\nvictims of trafficking in human beings nationally \r\nand internationally? Thirdly, how are we going to use \r\nnext year’s seventieth anniversary of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights to highlight the plight \r\nof victims of human trafficking and the urgent need \r\nfor States and civil society to assist and protect them, \r\nin accordance with the United Nations Global Plan of \r\nAction against Trafficking in Persons?\r\nThe President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 56/90 of 12 December 2001, I \r\ncall on the observer of the International Development \r\nLaw Organization.\r\nMs. Arenas Licea (International Development \r\nLaw Organization): The International Development \r\nLaw Organization (IDLO) welcomes this high-level \r\nmeeting and the adoption of the political declaration \r\n(resolution 72/1).\r\nAs the only intergovernmental organization with \r\nan exclusive mandate to advance the rule of law and \r\naccess to justice globally in the pursuit of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, our work is firmly focused on combating \r\nthe underlying factors that make people vulnerable to \r\ntrafficking, such as inequality, gender discrimination, \r\nsocial exclusion and marginalization.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nparticularly in Goal 16, provides us with a road map \r\nfor building a world in which the conditions that often \r\nbreed trafficking may be eradicated. Trafficking in \r\npersons is a heinous crime and antithetical to the rule \r\nof law. It is also a criminal act. Although trafficking \r\nis outlawed by several international treaties and \r\nconventions and despite the fact that Governments have \r\nmade progress in passing relevant national legislation, \r\nmuch remains to be done to strengthen existing legal \r\nframeworks so as to ensure that the tools exist to pursue \r\ncriminal charges. As part of our contribution towards \r\npreventing trafficking, the IDLO has provided technical \r\nassistance in the review and improvement of national \r\nlegislation in line with international standards, created \r\nnational anti-trafficking strategies and supported \r\ntheir implementation.\r\nA strong, independent judiciary, together with \r\nproperly trained police, prosecutors and border \r\nofficials, backed by laws and regulations in line with \r\ninternational obligations, means that well-established \r\ninstitutions will be able to bring those guilty of \r\ntrafficking to justice. Developing the capacity of \r\nlegal and justice systems is critical for us to be able \r\nto effectively tackle trafficking in persons. However, \r\ninstitutions are not enough. People must be made aware \r\nof their rights in order to be able to claim them. That is \r\nwhy, alongside its capacity-development programmes, \r\nthe IDLO also promotes legal-empowerment strategies \r\nand seeks to ensure that women, poor people, migrants \r\nand other marginalized groups can gain access to legal \r\nservices, including legal aid. These are key ingredients \r\nfor both prevention and protection.\r\nHuman trafficking continues to exploit millions of \r\nvictims, the majority of whom are women and girls. We \r\nneed to take a gender-centred approach when making \r\ninterventions to tackle trafficking. Any discussion on \r\nwomen and girl survivors of trafficking must take into \r\naccount the inequality and vulnerability that are often \r\nat the root of the problem. We cannot effectively protect \r\nwomen and girls from trafficking if we are not ready \r\nto combat gender discrimination globally and if we are \r\nA/72/PV.27 02/10/2017\r\n6/10 17-30366\r\nnot willing to work to shatter the power structures that \r\nperpetuate this global challenge. Ultimately, trafficking \r\nis a business that deals in human suffering.\r\nTrafficking is a cross-border, global problem that \r\nrequires global action. Let us all unite to work together \r\nto end it.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 51/1 of 15 October 1996, I \r\ncall on the observer of the International Criminal \r\nPolice Organization.\r\nMs. Neugebauer (International Criminal Police \r\nOrganization): I am happy to represent the International \r\nCriminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) at today’s \r\nhigh-level meeting on the appraisal of the Global Plan of \r\nAction to Combat Trafficking in Persons. INTERPOL \r\nis pleased to have been acknowledged in the political \r\ndeclaration (resolution 72/1) as an important contributor \r\nto combating this global phenomenon.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, trafficking in persons is \r\na crime that affects all regions and all countries in the \r\nworld. It has many different faces. Member States can \r\nbe affected as countries of origin, transit or destination. \r\nAlthough trafficking in persons takes such varied \r\nforms, international law-enforcement cooperation \r\nremains key to tackling any and all of them.\r\nAs the only global police organization, INTERPOL, \r\nwith its 192 member States, is ideally situated to help \r\nits members disrupt cross-border criminal networks. \r\nINTERPOL has three major programme strategies: \r\ncounter-terrorism, fighting cybercrime and combating \r\norganized and emerging crime. Our strategy against \r\norganized and emerging crime clearly establishes \r\nfighting human trafficking as one of INTERPOL’s \r\ngreatest commitments and aims to support member \r\nStates in combating this constantly evolving \r\nphenomenon. INTERPOL has a special unit on human \r\ntrafficking and child exploitation that provides training \r\nand operational support to law-enforcement officers \r\nwith a view to effectively tackling such phenomena.\r\nBorder protection is also key to effectively \r\ncombating human trafficking. Through INTERPOL’s \r\nsecure communication network, I-24/7, which \r\nfacilitates communication between law-enforcement \r\nauthorities around the globe in real time, all of our tools \r\nand databases can be accessed by them. The stolen and \r\nlost travel document database is particularly effective \r\nwhen it comes to countering trafficking in persons. It \r\ncurrently lists more than 70 million travel documents \r\nthat have been reported by 175 countries. That data \r\nis readily available, but even the most comprehensive \r\ndatabase is only truly effective if it is systematically \r\nused by front-line officers. We therefore encourage our \r\nmember States to extend access to relevant databases \r\nto border-control officers who need the relevant \r\ninformation in order to make the right decision at the \r\nright moment. Let me demonstrate the effectiveness of \r\nour databases through an example: in the past two weeks \r\nalone, 185 child sex-abuse victims have been identified \r\nfollowing checks against INTERPOL databases.\r\nINTERPOL Notices — international requests for \r\ncooperation — are another effective tool in combating \r\ntrafficking in persons. Everyone is familiar with Red \r\nNotices, which seek the location or arrest of wanted \r\ncriminals — in this case, traffickers in persons. But \r\nthere are other notices that are also highly effective, \r\nincluding the Green Notice, which is used to send \r\nwarnings about crimes that might extend to other \r\ncountries and is therefore particularly useful in the \r\nfight against trafficking in persons. Green Notices \r\ncan warn neighbouring States that a known child-sex \r\noffender, suspected trafficker or trafficking victim is \r\ntravelling to their region.\r\nIn conclusion, trafficking in persons is modern-\r\nday slavery. While it is clear that there are many forms \r\nof trafficking, they all have one thing in common: the \r\nabuse of vulnerable victims. INTERPOL takes a victim-\r\ncentric approach focused on identifying and protecting \r\nvictims. Within its mandate, INTERPOL will continue \r\nto do everything in its power to assist member States \r\nin identifying and disrupting the operative criminal \r\nnetworks that are behind human trafficking activities.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 47/4 of 16 October 1992, I call \r\non the observer of the International Organization \r\nfor Migration.\r\nMr. Gorman-Best (International Organization \r\nfor Migration): The International Organization for \r\nMigration (IOM) welcomes the progress made in and \r\nthe implementation of the Global Plan of Action to \r\nCombat Trafficking in Persons and supports its way \r\nforward. Over the past three decades, the IOM has \r\nbeen playing an active role in combating trafficking \r\nin persons. We fully support the Global Plan of Action \r\nand commend States Members of the United Nations \r\nfor adopting the political declaration (resolution 72/1).\r\n02/10/2017 A/72/PV.27\r\n17-30366 7/10\r\nThe Global Plan of Action is being reviewed at a \r\ntime of unprecedented global mobility, with 244 million \r\ninternational migrants globally. At the same time, the \r\nworld is facing multiple complex and protracted crises. \r\nThere are more than 65 million forcibly displaced \r\npersons on the planet today, of whom 40 million have \r\nbeen uprooted within their own countries. We know that \r\nthe rights of too many migrants continue to be violated \r\nduring their journeys and have learned from first-hand \r\nexperience that large-scale displacement caused by \r\nhumanitarian crises, such as armed conflicts, natural \r\ndisasters and protracted unrest, can create situations in \r\nwhich people become vulnerable to human trafficking. \r\nWith this in mind, I would like to highlight three areas \r\nin which, from the perspective of the IOM, a more \r\nconcerted effort is required.\r\nFirst, while protection frameworks for victims of \r\ntrafficking have been strengthened in recent years, less \r\nprogress has been made in preventing human trafficking \r\nfrom occurring in the first place. The demand for cheap \r\ngoods and sexual services is what drives trafficking. \r\nEfforts should therefore be made to reduce the demand \r\nfor goods and services produced by trafficked persons \r\nand exploited migrants. This requires the engagement \r\nof those creating the demand, namely, consumers \r\nand businesses. Concrete measures include efforts to \r\nencourage, assist or obligate companies to establish \r\ndecent working conditions for all employees in their \r\nsupply chains.\r\nSecondly, despite progress in creating legal \r\nframeworks to better protect those identified as victims \r\nof trafficking, the number of people benefiting from \r\nthese protection schemes remains small when compared \r\nto the estimated millions of people who continue to be \r\ntrafficked. In order to address this issue, it is important \r\nto increase the capacities of Governments and civil \r\nsociety in identifying and assisting all migrants in \r\nvulnerable situations, including victims of trafficking. \r\nEfforts should also target high-risk locations, such as \r\nborder-crossing points, as well as sectors and industries \r\nin which there is a high risk of trafficking and for which \r\neffective responses are urgently required. It is also \r\nessential to ensure that anti-trafficking measures are \r\nsystematically included in all phases of humanitarian \r\naction, especially in responding to conflict and disasters.\r\nThirdly and finally, greater investment is needed \r\nif we are to learn from anti-trafficking interventions \r\nand draw on the experience and expertise of the \r\nanti-trafficking community and others to date with a \r\nview to having informed anti-trafficking responses. We \r\nmust work towards better collection, standardization \r\nand sharing of data on trafficking. We need to find \r\nways to overcome obstacles to data-sharing, within \r\na framework of strict confidentiality and appropriate \r\nsafeguards so as to protect the personal data of \r\nindividuals. This can be achieved through the use of \r\nmulti-stakeholder open-data publishing platforms such \r\nas the IOM Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative, \r\nwhich will be launched next month.\r\nIn conclusion, the Global Plan of Action is an \r\nexcellent opportunity to reinvigorate our collective \r\nefforts. I would like to close by reiterating the deep \r\ncommitment of the IOM to continuing to work with \r\nMember States and our other partners, including entities \r\nwithin the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against \r\nTrafficking in Persons, with a view to eradicating \r\nhuman trafficking within the overall context of \r\nfacilitating safe, regular and orderly migration for the \r\nbenefit of all.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthis high-level meeting.\r\nIn accordance with resolution 71/207 of 4 May \r\n2017, we will now hear presentations of summaries by \r\nthe Chairs of the two interactive panel discussions.\r\nI now give the f loor to the Chair of the delegation \r\nof Belgium, in his capacity as Chair of interactive panel \r\ndiscussion 1.\r\nMr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium): Interactive \r\npanel discussion 1 was entitled “The Global Plan of \r\nAction and effective partnerships for the prevention and \r\nprosecution of trafficking in persons: achievements, \r\ngaps and challenges, also taking into consideration \r\nthe implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals”. Speakers emphasized the importance of \r\nimplementing appropriate prevention measures and \r\neffective prosecution of trafficking in persons, which \r\nconstitute two fundamental pillars of the Global Plan of \r\nAction, together with protection and partnerships.\r\nSpeakers also noted the need to develop and \r\nimplement holistic and comprehensive responses so as \r\nto fully eradicate trafficking in persons. Participants \r\nstrongly emphasized the urgent need to implement \r\na victim-centred and survivor-based approach to \r\ncombating trafficking. They urged for an approach \r\nthat gives priority to the human rights of victims \r\nand survivors, places them at the centre of efforts to \r\nA/72/PV.27 02/10/2017\r\n8/10 17-30366\r\nshape policy in operational responses and ensures \r\nadequate support for survivors’ long-term reintegration \r\nand recovery.\r\nSpeakers also noted that victim protection and \r\nassistance were critical in ensuring the effective \r\nprosecution of perpetrators of trafficking and \r\nrecommended that Member States increase their \r\ncapacity to properly identify and subsequently protect \r\nand assist victims. Speakers also underlined the need to \r\nunderstand and address the root causes of trafficking in \r\npersons, which include, among other things, poverty, \r\nlack of economic opportunity, social-protection \r\nf laws, education, gender inequalities and other \r\nsocioeconomic factors.\r\nParticipants recommended giving further attention \r\nto the complex interaction of factors that fuel inequality \r\nand discrimination and contribute to people’s \r\nvulnerability to being trafficked. Participants noted \r\nthat human trafficking is becoming an increasingly \r\ncommon feature in situations of conflict, when \r\nvulnerability to trafficking, from gender-based violence \r\nto discrimination to lack of economic opportunity, are \r\nfurther intensified.\r\nSpeakers noted that impunity, the breakdown \r\nof the rule of law and destruction of institutions \r\nduring conflict significantly increase the conditions \r\nin which terrorists and criminal groups exploit the \r\nvulnerabilities of individuals, particularly women and \r\nchildren. Speakers recalled the increasing number of \r\nwomen, men and children who embark on dangerous \r\njourneys in search of dignity and safety, placing \r\nthemselves at risk of abuse and exploitation by criminal \r\ngroups. Participants recalled the close alignment of the \r\ncommitments adopted by the General Assembly in the \r\nNew York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants in \r\n2016, the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, each of which calls for the eradication of \r\nhuman trafficking in all its forms, among other things.\r\nFinally, speakers, noting that the vast majority of \r\ntrafficked victims were women and girls, emphasized \r\nthe gender-based aspect of the phenomenon, urging \r\nthe international community to address the sexual \r\nexploitation of women and girls in all contexts. In \r\nthis respect, participants called for greater attention \r\nto be given to the linkages connecting trafficking, \r\nmigration and gender, as there are numerous gender-\r\nspecific vulnerabilities that put women and girls at \r\nparticular risk. Here, again, the potential unleashed \r\nby implementing Sustainable Development Goal 5 was \r\nhighlighted by some participants.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the Chair \r\nof the delegation of Qatar, in her capacity as Chair of \r\ninteractive panel discussion 2.\r\nMs. Al-Thani (Qatar): Speakers in interactive \r\npanel discussion 2 recalled that trafficking in persons \r\nis mentioned in three of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals: Goals 5.2, 8.7 and 16.2. They further noted \r\nthat trafficking also relates indirectly to many other \r\nSustainable Development Goals and targets in the \r\nareas of human rights, migration, crisis resilience and \r\nsocial inclusion, as reflected in the pledge to leave no \r\none behind. Participants also noted the importance \r\nof education and awareness-raising campaigns in \r\npreventing trafficking in persons, as highlighted in the \r\npolitical declaration on the implementation of the United \r\nNations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons (resolution 72/1). Above all, participants \r\nreaffirmed the importance of political will in the \r\npursuit of multifaceted approaches to ending the crime \r\nof trafficking in persons. Speakers also reiterated the \r\nurgent need for greater and more predictable resources, \r\nincluding funding, to combat trafficking in persons.\r\nMany speakers also highlighted the important role \r\nplayed by the United Nations voluntary trust fund for \r\nvictims of trafficking in persons, especially women \r\nand children, and called for enhanced support for the \r\ntrust fund so as to allow its good work to continue. \r\nParticipants further stressed the need for specific \r\nmeasures to be taken to address human trafficking \r\nresulting from situations of conflict, humanitarian \r\ncrises and natural disasters. Speakers highlighted the \r\nneed for systematic responses from the United Nations \r\nsystem, all humanitarian actors and the wide range of \r\nactors involved in conflict and crisis-affected areas.\r\nParticipants also recognized the particular \r\nvulnerability of migrants and refugees to being \r\ntrafficked and called for them to be afforded greater \r\nprotection. Speakers noted the need for a comprehensive \r\nand holistic approach to the issue of trafficking, \r\naddressing all its aspects rather than focusing on \r\nindividual components. Participants reiterated the need \r\nfor a greater emphasis on partnerships and coordination. \r\nIn this respect, speakers emphasized the central role \r\nthat is played by the Inter-Agency Coordination Group \r\nagainst Trafficking in Persons and underscored the \r\n02/10/2017 A/72/PV.27\r\n17-30366 9/10\r\nimportant roles played by civil society, academia and \r\nthe private sector in supporting prevention, protection \r\nand prosecution efforts.\r\nFinally, many speakers reiterated the important \r\nrole that the private sector should play in addressing the \r\nissue of consumers and consumer demand as a driver \r\nof trafficking.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President: I cannot express how disturbed I \r\nwas by the personal experiences recounted by Grizelda \r\nGrootboom, Shireen Ibrahim, Rani Hong and many \r\nothers. I know that the Assembly was also shocked. I \r\nwould like to thank Ms. Grootboom, a survivor and \r\nadvocate, for bravely sharing her experience of being \r\ntrafficked. Let us not forget Ms. Grootboom’s plea to \r\nact when she said,\r\n“I really hope that the Global Plan will not be \r\njust the action of putting pen to paper, but that it \r\nwill inspire action in every rural township and city \r\nand country” (A/72/PV.24, p. 9).\r\nMs. Grootboom spoke of the hope that the United \r\nNations gives to victims and survivors. The Organization \r\nwas created for people, not for Governments. We \r\ncannot let down her or the millions of other people who \r\nare trafficked around the world for billions of dollars. \r\nMs. Mira Sorvino, Goodwill Ambassador Goodwill \r\nAmbassador for the Global Fight against Human \r\nTrafficking, commented that traffickers treat victims \r\nas mercantile goods. Ms. Rani Hong, a former victim \r\nwho is now an advocate, recalled being taken from her \r\nmother at the tender age of seven and sold. We must \r\nsupport the dignity, human rights and humanity of the \r\npeople who are affected by human trafficking.\r\nAs Ms. Hong said, this is a human issue that \r\nrequires survivor-led solutions. We are all undoubtedly \r\ngrateful for the Grizelda Grootbooms, Shireen \r\nIbrahims, women and girls and boys and men of the \r\nworld who are all people who deserve to live a decent \r\nand dignified life, without fear of trafficking. But I am \r\nparticularly grateful to all of the advocates who give \r\nvoices to the voiceless millions who are subjected to \r\nhuman trafficking.\r\nIn the opening segment of this high-level appraisal, \r\nwe heard from the Secretary-General and the Executive \r\nDirector of the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime, who highlighted the importance of holding \r\nperpetrators accountable. We also adopted a political \r\ndeclaration (resolution 72/1), which represents a strong \r\nrenewed commitment for action going forward and \r\nreaffirmation of the Global Plan of Action. We must \r\nturn that gesture into practical action.\r\nAt this high-level meeting we heard statements \r\nfrom 98 Member States, whose representatives included \r\nsome 10 Ministers and seven Deputy Ministers, as well \r\nas from six observers. As we just heard from the Chairs \r\nof the two interactive panel discussions, the Chairs \r\nof the delegations of Qatar and Belgium, the panel \r\ndiscussions were fruitful. However, the true measure \r\nof a successful meeting is whether the action points \r\nelicited are implemented afterwards. Our work is far \r\nfrom over.\r\nWe have essentially asked two questions. How far \r\nhave we come in combating human trafficking? And \r\nhow much further do we have to go? The following \r\npoints were made during this high-level appraisal.\r\nFirst, millions of people are victims of forced \r\nlabour, sexual servitude and other forms of exploitation. \r\nTrafficking in persons affects the weakest and most \r\nvulnerable members of society, including women, girls \r\nand boys.\r\nSecond, a number of Member States highlighted \r\nthe importance of using the United Nations Convention \r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime, the Protocol \r\nto Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in \r\nPersons, Especially Women and Children, and other \r\ninternational instruments in our fight against human \r\ntrafficking. Many Member States also shared their \r\nnational plans and laws to combat human trafficking. \r\nThey noted that it is a serious crime and a violation of \r\nfundamental rights.\r\nThird, various Member States called on the \r\nAssembly to adopt approaches that are victim-focused, \r\nsurvivor-based, human rights-based, gender-specific \r\nand child-sensitive. There was also an emphasis on \r\nthe importance of multi-stakeholder approaches, \r\nawareness-raising campaigns and bilateral, regional \r\nand international cooperation.\r\nFourth, the importance of addressing the root \r\ncauses and factors contributing to trafficking was \r\nhighlighted. They include poverty, a lack of education \r\nand opportunity and gender inequality. Many speakers \r\npointed out that the increase in conflicts, insecurity \r\nand economic uncertainty that has forced millions \r\nA/72/PV.27 02/10/2017\r\n10/10 17-30366\r\nto leave their homes makes people vulnerable. \r\nParticipants called for the adoption of a global compact \r\nfor safe, orderly and regular migration to address the \r\nvulnerability of migrants.\r\nFifth, Member States reiterated that the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, particularly Goals 5, 8 and 16, \r\ncall on us to end human trafficking, with a particular \r\nemphasis on women and children.\r\nSixth, there were calls for increased access to \r\njustice and an emphasis on the importance of disrupting \r\ntrafficking networks, facilitating prosecution and \r\nimproving conviction rates of traffickers.\r\nSeventh, many speakers drew attention to the huge \r\nprofits being made from human trafficking and the \r\nneed to address both supply and demand.\r\nFinally, the importance of strengthening support \r\nfor victims, particularly through the United Nations \r\nvoluntary trust fund for victims of trafficking in persons, \r\nespecially women and children, was highlighted. I \r\ncommend those who have pledged contributions and \r\nencourage others to do the same.\r\nIn conclusion, we have heard from Member States \r\non the progress made in fighting human trafficking. \r\nHowever, as many have highlighted, much remains to be \r\ndone across the four pillars of prevention, prosecution, \r\nprotection and partnership. As we take further action to \r\ncombat human trafficking, let us keep in mind the fifth \r\nP — the reason that the United Nations exists — people.\r\nI declare closed the high-level meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the appraisal of the United \r\nNations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking \r\nin Persons.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 107.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.10 a.m.\r\n"
