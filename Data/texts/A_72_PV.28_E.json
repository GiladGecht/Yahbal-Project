"United Nations A/72/PV.28\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n28th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 3 October 2017, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 110 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/72/1)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the \r\nSecretary-General presented his annual report (A/72/1) \r\nto the General Assembly at its 3rd plenary meeting on \r\n19 September 2017.\r\nMr. Mnatsakanyan (Armenia): Once again, \r\nMr. President, Armenia congratulates you on your \r\nelection and assures you of its full support.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s first report (A/72/1) since \r\nhis election to lead our Organization reflects the \r\nconsiderable complexity of addressing the many \r\nobjectives of our collective global agenda. We \r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his strong focus on \r\nthe major challenges before us and for the action he has \r\ntaken in a short period of time. Above all, the report \r\nis a manifestation of a commitment to multilateralism \r\nas an effective instrument for addressing the mix of \r\nchallenges. It is a refreshing reminder that it is not \r\npossible for individual States in isolation to address our \r\nglobal challenges, from climate change to population \r\ngrowth, from displacement and migration to inequality \r\nand exclusion, and from national institutions to \r\nglobal terrorism and threats to peace and security. \r\nMultilateralism is not optional, and we agree on that.\r\nThe United Nations will have to recalibrate itself \r\nto address the current global agenda. Without reform, \r\nit will be doomed to ad hoc reactions, inertia and \r\nreduced effectiveness. If we share a common and strong \r\ncommitment to multilateralism, we simply cannot avoid \r\nreform. Armenia therefore reiterates its full support to \r\nthe Secretary-General’s reform agenda. We understand \r\nthat it is a work in progress, and we also accept that \r\nwhile the Secretary-General enjoys a mandate from the \r\nmembership to ensure that the United Nations system’s \r\ncapacity is strong and action-oriented, it is he who is \r\nresponsible for taking action to adapt the system.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the Secretary-General’s \r\nfull engagement with Member States in sharing and \r\ntesting his concept of reform. The past few months \r\nhave demonstrated the Secretariat’s serious intellectual \r\nand analytical engagement and the leadership of \r\nthe Secretary-General in introducing a holistic \r\nreform agenda with three fundamental constituent \r\nparts — reform of the United Nations development \r\nsystem, management reform and reform of the peace \r\nand security architecture. We are looking forward to \r\nthe next phases of the reform agenda’s implementation.\r\nArmenia particularly welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s doctrine whereby prevention is placed at the \r\nheart of United Nations action. We have consistently \r\npromoted that concept, with particular emphasis on \r\nearly prevention and action. We therefore welcome a \r\nholistic approach to prevention in all its complexity. \r\nIf early prevention is accepted as the most effective \r\nmethod of interrupting deteriorating situations, a \r\nrights-based approach should carry particular weight.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

We \r\nwelcome the report’s recognition of that premise. As it \r\nstresses, peace is indeed a human rights imperative.\r\nOnly strong States are capable of delivering \r\neffectively on this agenda in order to secure early \r\nprevention. Strong States are inclusive States, in which \r\na strong civil society, an open media and a vibrant \r\nprivate sector all participate in advancing the national \r\nagenda. Early prevention depends on detecting, \r\nrecognizing and acting on deteriorating human rights \r\nsituations, and it remains the primary responsibility \r\nof States. That responsibility should be driven by a \r\ndeep recognition of the risks of permitting the social \r\nfabric to be undermined, exposing vulnerable groups \r\nto serious human rights violations and amplifying the \r\nlikelihood of atrocities.\r\nThe irresponsibility of inflammatory hate speech, \r\nintolerance, xenophobia, racial and ethnic profiling and \r\nthe glorification of hate crimes, especially when such \r\nbehaviour is led and encouraged by a State’s political \r\nleaders, should be of concern to the entire international \r\ncommunity and serve as a clear early-warning sign \r\nof potential conflict and atrocity crimes. The United \r\nNations has the capacity to detect such early-warning \r\nsigns and address them.\r\nFor its part, Armenia will continue working to help \r\nconsolidate international efforts to prevent genocide. \r\nThe year 2018 marks the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide. While about one third of United \r\nNations Member States have still not acceded to or \r\nratified the Convention, Armenia proposes to use the \r\noccasion of its seventieth anniversary to launch a resolute \r\nUnited Nations-wide campaign for raising awareness of \r\nthe Convention and the need for its universalization. \r\nThe International Day of Commemoration and \r\nDignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and \r\nof the Prevention of this Crime, which we mark on \r\n9 December, will be a fitting occasion for setting that \r\ncampaign in motion.\r\nWhile we emphasize the primary role of States \r\nin advancing the prevention agenda, in restating our \r\ncommitment to multilateralism, we recognize the \r\nsignificant potential of international cooperation, \r\nbacked by sufficient financing, to achieve collective \r\ngood at the regional and international levels. The \r\nSecretary-General’s stated objective of making the \r\nUnited Nations a better partner for Member States in \r\ntheir efforts to meet their responsibilities, and the fact \r\nthat he has placed it at the heart of his reform agenda, is \r\nhighly commendable.\r\nIn Armenia, we are gradually reaping the benefits \r\nof working with the United Nations and its country \r\nteam in advancing our national development agenda, \r\nmaking full use of the 2030 Agenda as an international \r\npolicy framework. Together with the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, we have been setting up a \r\nnational platform to support accelerated implementation \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals, promote public-\r\nsector innovation and leverage private capital through \r\nimpact investment. Armenia emphasizes the strong \r\neffects of innovation, creative education and inclusive \r\nand collaborative joint action by the Government, \r\ncivil society and the private sector in advancing \r\nsmart development.\r\nAlthough middle-income countries will continue \r\nto require the attention of international financial \r\ninstitutions and the United Nations development \r\nsystem, regional and international partnerships remain \r\nas important as ever. As a landlocked developing \r\ncountry, Armenia particularly emphasizes the \r\nimportance of accessible and unimpeded transport \r\nand transit corridors, and deplores unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures and the imposition of blockades and closed \r\nborders that worsen existing infrastructure deficits. We \r\nare looking forward to presenting our first voluntary \r\nnational review at the meeting of the High-level \r\nPolitical Forum on Sustainable Development to be held \r\nunder the auspices of the Economic and Social Council \r\nin 2018, and are happy to share our experience with \r\nour partners.\r\nWith regard to its peace and security pillar, the \r\nOrganization continues to face the considerable and \r\nmultifaceted challenges of unresolved conflicts, global \r\nterrorism and other vulnerable situations. Displacement \r\nand migration remain an important focus of our collective \r\nagenda, including from the peace and security angle. In \r\nthe past four years alone, Armenia has become a host \r\nto more than 22,000 displaced people from the Middle \r\n03/10/2017 A/72/PV.28\r\n17-30665 3/20\r\nEast. We welcome the Secretary-General’s concept \r\nof building anticipatory relationships with national \r\nand regional partners in order to prevent conflict, as \r\nwell as addressing the root causes of conflict across \r\nthe three pillars of peace and security, human rights \r\nand inclusive development. The evolving proposal for \r\nrecalibrating the peacebuilding function of the United \r\nNations within the peace and security architecture \r\ndeserves close attention. Once again, we commend \r\nthe focus on prevention in supporting an integrated, \r\nstrategic and coherent approach to sustaining peace.\r\nWe also underline the importance of strong \r\ncollaboration with regional settings, platforms and \r\nformats for sustaining peace and resolving conflicts and \r\npreventing duplication of effort, which has the effect of \r\nblurring the focus on sustainable, peacefully negotiated \r\nand compromise-based solutions, encouraging forum-\r\nshopping and undermining the efforts of parties in \r\ninternationally mandated formats. In that respect, we are \r\nvery grateful to the Secretary-General for his continued \r\ncommitment and unequivocal support to the co-Chairs \r\nof the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe in their efforts to achieve a \r\npeaceful resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.\r\nThe Secretary-General concludes his report with \r\nthe significant observation that the onus is on the \r\nUnited Nations to prove its worth. It is a call to heed \r\nthe contradictory and complex challenges of our \r\ncurrent agenda and to recall the foundations of the \r\nUnited Nations as it was born out of the destruction \r\nand calamity of the twentieth century’s two devastating \r\nworld wars. It is an invitation to reflect on our collective \r\nconscience, as the United Nations does not consist only \r\nof the Secretary-General and the Secretariat. As of \r\ntoday, it is constituted by 193 sovereign States sharing \r\nresponsibility for the peoples in whose name, after all, \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations was written.\r\nMrs. Rodríguez Abascal (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We thank you, Mr. President, for presenting \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/72/1) and would like to express our \r\nappreciation for the work you have done in this first \r\nmonth of your mandate.\r\nThe United Nations is becoming more and more \r\nrelevant to the people of the world every day. Our \r\nmultilateral institution represents the hope of millions \r\nfor a better world, where peace, goodwill and the \r\nyearning for a better world prevail over war, threats and \r\nfear of the disappearance of the human species. That is \r\nwhere we see the Organization’s relevance and where the \r\nimportance of multilateralism is affirmed once again. \r\nAs the Secretary-General rightly says, multilateral \r\naction is more necessary than ever if we want to find \r\neffective solutions to today’s converging challenges.\r\nAlthough we have major commitments that provide \r\na road map for achieving sustainable development, such \r\nas the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \r\nReduction and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, there \r\nare continuing challenges to their implementation at \r\nboth the national and international levels. According \r\nto data from the Food and Agriculture Organization, \r\nabout 108 million people globally suffered from severe \r\nfood insecurity in 2016, a drastic increase compared \r\nto the figure of 80 million in 2015. In addition, some \r\n700 million people continue to live in extremely \r\ndifficult conditions. The impact of climate change as \r\nreflected in recurring natural disasters, as well as in the \r\nvirtual destruction of infrastructure in many developing \r\ncountries, has led to the loss of many lives. We are \r\nconcerned about the fact that developing countries lack \r\nthe new, additional and predictable financial resources \r\nand the infrastructure and technology they need in \r\norder to implement these agendas at the national level.\r\nThe Cuban people have much to be proud of in \r\nterms of our achievements over the past six decades. \r\nTo cite just a few examples, we were the first country \r\nto end illiteracy in Latin America. The World \r\nHealth Organization recently certified Cuba as the \r\nfirst country on Earth to eliminate mother-to-child \r\ntransmission of HIV/AIDS and syphilis, and UNICEF \r\nhas declared Cuba free of child malnutrition. All of this \r\nis the result of the high quality of our renowned free \r\nhealth and education systems, whose main concern is \r\nthe right to life and the well-being of the Cuban people. \r\nOur revolution is of the people, by the people and for \r\nthe people.\r\nWe are proud to belong to a zone of peace, as \r\nannounced at the second Summit of the Community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, held in Havana \r\nin January 2014. Cuba emphasizes that the rules of \r\ncoexistence, based on friendship, cooperation and \r\nrespect, without interference in the internal affairs of \r\nother nations, are essential in international relations \r\namong States.\r\nA/72/PV.28 03/10/2017\r\n4/20 17-30665\r\nWe reiterate that the best way to prevent conflict is \r\nto eradicate its root causes. In that regard, Cuba urges \r\nthe international community to redouble its efforts \r\nto eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, \r\nincluding inequality, hunger and social exclusion. We \r\naffirm that unwavering respect for the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law must continue to be a basic pillar \r\nof international security. That means ensuring full \r\nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nStates, refraining from the use or threat of use of force \r\nin international relations and from interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of States, as well as working to settle \r\ninternational disputes by peaceful means.\r\nIf we want to change the current unjust and \r\nprofoundly unequal international order, we must \r\nstop applying unilateral coercive measures aimed at \r\ndeveloping countries and put an end to colonialism \r\nand foreign occupation. We reaffirm that respect for \r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural systems that \r\nnations have freely chosen for themselves promotes not \r\nonly sustainable development but also the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. Cuba firmly \r\ndenounces and rejects the unjust economic, trade and \r\nfinancial embargo that the United States of America \r\nhas imposed on it for more than 50 years. Backed by \r\nmore than 11 million Cubans and with the support of \r\nthe international community, we call once again for the \r\nlifting of this cruel blockade, which is a violation of \r\ninternational law and of the human rights of all Cubans, \r\nwhom it has deprived of their full enjoyment of the right \r\nto development.\r\nWe have taken note of the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral aimed at reforming the Organization. In order \r\nfor the United Nations to be more democratic and \r\neffective, the General Assembly should be revitalized \r\nand strengthened and able to fully exercise the powers \r\nconferred on it by the Charter, without interference \r\nfrom the Security Council in its work or its entities. \r\nReforming the Security Council with a view to making \r\nit more democratic and representative requires changing \r\nits composition and working methods, and we must not \r\npostpone that any longer.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize to you, \r\nMr. President, and to the Secretary-General, Cuba’s \r\ncommitment to multilateralism and to safeguarding \r\na prosperous and peaceful world for present and \r\nfuture generations.\r\nMs. Mejía Vélez (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nColombia is grateful for the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/72/1), which lays out a valuable road map \r\nfor the reforms that he has proposed and takes us on \r\na geopolitical and strategic journey through the true \r\nrole of multilateralism, led by the United Nations, at \r\none of the most critical times that the world has seen \r\nsince our Organization was founded, 72 years ago. The \r\nnotion that we need a more analytical document rather \r\nthan a summary of activities has been apparent for \r\nmany years. We firmly believe that in October 2018, a \r\nyear from now, when we meet once again in this Hall \r\nto analyse what this document has achieved, we will \r\nnot just be describing the past and sometimes repeating \r\nsterile diagnoses but seeing the results of an ambitious \r\nand inclusive process of change, which Colombia \r\nfully supports.\r\nA stronger, more effective multilateralism will \r\nenable the United Nations to achieve ambitious goals \r\nin the areas of peace, development and human rights. I \r\ncan say with certainty that we have specific examples \r\nthat have shown that it is possible to approach this \r\ntask with optimism, despite the difficulties. Various \r\nMember States are seeing a greater good reflected \r\nin the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the Forum on Financing for Development \r\nand the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and are now \r\nsigning up to the New York Declaration for Refugees \r\nand Migrants and the Ocean Conference’s voluntary \r\ncommitments. That is cause for optimism. We are seeing \r\nevidence that when there is a high level of involvement \r\nand political will on the part of States and when they \r\nconsistently and persistently work towards a win-win \r\nsituation in our Organization, it is possible to establish \r\nan architecture that benefits humankind. Once again, \r\nI want to emphasize the indisputable relevance of the \r\nUnited Nations for addressing today’s challenges.\r\nRight now, if we are to achieve that win-win \r\nscenario in the area of international peace and security, \r\nwe must be bold, as is evidenced in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General and in his vision for the future. As \r\nthe Secretary-General says and has reiterated in recent \r\nmonths, in its approach to attaining sustainable peace \r\nthe Organization should focus its efforts on prevention \r\nand on reacting more quickly in order to get results that \r\ncan have the real impact that we all seek on the ground. \r\nAs the report says, we must make our institution agile \r\nand able to deliver results.\r\n03/10/2017 A/72/PV.28\r\n17-30665 5/20\r\nI would like to mention two things that are \r\nparticularly important to my delegation. The initiative \r\nfor achieving gender parity at the senior management \r\nlevel by 2021, clearly outlined by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, brings us closer to a goal that has eluded us \r\nfor decades. Through that proposal, we now believe it \r\nis possible. We should also give due recognition to the \r\ncross-cutting nature of the gender perspective in areas \r\nsuch as sustainable peace. In the case of my country \r\nand its journey towards peace, the United Nations has \r\nplayed a major role in it through the first special political \r\nmission of the Security Council to Colombia, which is \r\nending this week, giving way to a new phase through a \r\nsecond, verification mission. In addition to that is all of \r\nthe support we have been shown, which in the next few \r\nhours will culminate in a bilateral ceasefire with the \r\nNational Liberation Army, a proof of the commitment \r\nto accompanying us on that journey.\r\nThat is why we can say, based on the lessons we have \r\nlearned, that the proposal for a structural transformation \r\nof the Secretariat is essential and will lead to results \r\nthat will literally be seen on the ground on a daily basis, \r\naimed at achieving the principal goal of the United \r\nNations, which is helping the men, women and children \r\nin every part of the world aff licted by conflict or war. \r\nWe are of the firm belief that we can do this through \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding operations and special \r\npolitical missions that address our pressing political, \r\nmilitary and humanitarian challenges. A dysfunctional \r\nbureaucracy should no longer be an obstacle. In order to \r\nachieve those goals and overcome the other challenges \r\nthat the Secretary-General in his report, it will not \r\nbe enough simply to make those proposals. A firm \r\npolitical commitment from all of us, the Member States, \r\nis crucial. The ground has already been prepared with \r\nimportant contributions. The time for diagnoses is over. \r\nWe must move on to action, without delay, because that \r\ncould mean the difference between life or death and \r\npeace or war.\r\nMr. Gafoor (Singapore): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to express our appreciation to Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres for his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/72/1), which we note is his first since \r\nassuming office.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report, which not only \r\nprovides a sobering reminder of the multiple challenges \r\nfacing the United Nations but also highlights the \r\nimportant role of the United Nations in addressing \r\nthem. There are many crises yet to be resolved, but \r\nthe world would be worse off if it were not for the \r\nwork of the United Nations. As we heard from many \r\nleaders over the past week during the general debate, \r\ntoday we need the United Nations more than ever. A \r\nuniversal, rule-based multilateral system is essential if \r\nwe are to solve the complex problems confronting the \r\nworld. No nation can deal with transboundary problems \r\nalone. The United Nations has a critical role to play as \r\na platform for cooperation based on the principles of \r\nmutual respect, mutual benefit and international law.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that the figures and \r\ndiagrams are a welcome addition to this year’s report. \r\nThey are very useful and contribute significantly to \r\nhighlighting the progress achieved over the past year. \r\nFor example, the improvement in the percentage of \r\nwomen who are heads or deputy heads of missions is \r\nclearly depicted in figure IX, along with the significant \r\ndistance still to go before gender parity is achieved. We \r\nalso greatly appreciate the summary of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s key initiatives in 2017 that appears right \r\nafter the introduction in the report. This list clearly \r\ndemonstrates that Secretary-General Guterres has \r\nset about tackling our multiple challenges head-on \r\nimmediately after taking office, taking steps to make \r\nthe United Nations fit for purpose and outlining a \r\nclear vision for how the United Nations can do better. \r\nWe look forward to further updates on initiatives \r\nintroduced in 2017. We would now like to make three \r\npoints pertaining to the report.\r\nFirst, we support the Secretary-General’s \r\ncommitment to reforming the United Nations in order \r\nto make it more effective, nimble and accountable, \r\nwith a view to improving its delivery of its mandate \r\nand making a real impact on people on the ground. \r\nWe particularly welcome his drive to make the United \r\nNations more transparent and accountable to the \r\nmembership. We share his view that the Organization \r\nmust become more transparent and able to demonstrate \r\na clear link between resources and results much more \r\nvisibly and meaningfully. In that regard, we see the \r\nSecretary-General’s annual report as an important \r\nmechanism for transparency and accountability. We \r\nwould therefore like to see it further improved to focus \r\non results, and specifically on what the United Nations \r\nis doing to make a difference to people on the ground. \r\nIt would help if the report also included an annex with a \r\none-page outline of some of the key statistics and figures \r\nshowing how the United Nations had made a positive \r\nA/72/PV.28 03/10/2017\r\n6/20 17-30665\r\nimpact globally over the past year that could then be \r\nused to profile the work of the Organization positively.\r\nSecondly, just as the report begins with a snapshot \r\nof the Secretary-General’s main initiatives, we would \r\nsuggest that it conclude with a concise list of his \r\npriorities and objectives for the upcoming year. Of \r\ncourse, we understand that those may change during \r\nthe year with the vagaries of international crises and \r\ndevelopments. However, a list of priorities would \r\nenable Member States to better understand the key \r\nplatforms in the Secretary-General’s agenda for the \r\nyear and, more importantly, objectively assess progress \r\non them throughout the year. For example, we welcome \r\nthe Secretary-General’s commitment to achieving \r\ngender parity at the senior leadership level by 2021, \r\nwhich is listed as one of his main initiatives for 2017. \r\nA commitment that explicit not only communicates \r\nthe Secretary-General’s priorities and goals in a clear \r\nand measurable way, it also reflects a willingness on \r\nhis part to be accountable to Member States for his \r\nactions and priorities and for achieving what he wishes \r\nto achieve. It shows that he is willing to lead from the \r\ntop in transforming the Organization so that it is more \r\nfocused on delivery and results than on mere process.\r\nThirdly and lastly, it is evident throughout the \r\nreport that the United Nations and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral attach great importance to effective \r\npartnerships between the United Nations and regional \r\nand subregional organizations, which often have a \r\nvaluable understanding of the particular contexts and \r\ncircumstances of individual regions. In South-East \r\nAsia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN) plays a critical role in securing regional \r\npeace and fostering regional economic integration. We \r\nare pleased that the United Nations concluded a new \r\nplan of action with ASEAN in 2016. The partnership \r\nmust be strengthened, and we look forward to the \r\nSecretary-General’s visit to Manila in November for \r\nthe upcoming ASEAN Summit.\r\nFor its part, as the incoming ASEAN Chair for 2018, \r\nSingapore looks forward to working with the United \r\nNations and the Secretary-General to explore new ways \r\nto enhance the partnership with ASEAN. In that regard, \r\nit is our hope that next year the Secretary-General’s \r\nannual report will devote greater attention to the issues \r\nand highlight the partnerships that the United Nations \r\nhas with various regional organizations throughout the \r\nworld. Ultimately, it is important that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the United Nations lay out a clear plan and \r\npathway for building partnerships with regional and \r\nsubregional organizations around the world with a view \r\nto addressing the key global challenges of our time.\r\nIn conclusion, Singapore strongly supports the work \r\nof the United Nations, which has made a significant \r\ndifference to the lives of people around the world. \r\nWe need to safeguard and strengthen our multilateral \r\nrule-based system so that even the smallest country \r\ncan survive and thrive as an independent, sovereign \r\nnation. In that regard, the work of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly the work of the Secretary-General, is \r\nabsolutely critical. Singapore reiterates its support \r\nfor the Secretary-General, and we look forward to \r\ncontinuing to work constructively with him so that as \r\nthe United Nations we can collectively build a better \r\nfuture for all our people.\r\nMr. Rybakov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): We \r\nhave read the report of the Secretary-General (A/72/1) \r\non the work of the Organization with interest.\r\nThe United Nations is clearly faced with the \r\ndifficult choice of staying within its customary limits \r\nand conducting business as usual or of moving forward, \r\nwhile listening to the voice of each individual State \r\nand taking account of their specific needs. In that \r\ncontext we support the Secretary-General’s view on the \r\ncrucial importance of revitalizing the commitment to \r\nthe principle of multilateralism, which enables States \r\nto combine their resources so as to overcome the \r\nchallenges and threats of today. Belarus has frequently \r\nnoted that many conflict situations could be avoided \r\nif the United Nations were truly committed to a spirit \r\nof unity.\r\nWorking for political mediation at the early stages \r\nof a confrontation is unquestionably an effective part \r\nof the ways by which we can maintain international \r\npeace and security. In that regard, we agree with the \r\nSecretary-General’s approach in terms of its focus \r\non preventive action aimed at avoiding conflicts. \r\nPeacebuilding should not be perceived as solely \r\nintended for post-conflict situations. At the same time, \r\nwe understand that new times bring new challenges \r\nand threats. In that regard, we believe the initiative of \r\nthe President of the Republic of Belarus in launching a \r\nnew Helsinki process is timely and has the potential to \r\nbecome a platform for dialogue aimed at overcoming \r\ndifferences among States all over the world.\r\nNaturally, in summing up the past year, we have \r\nnoted the Secretary-General’s active efforts aimed at \r\n03/10/2017 A/72/PV.28\r\n17-30665 7/20\r\nreorganizing the United Nations. While in that regard \r\nwe have confidence in the Secretary-General as an \r\nexperienced international official, we do not believe \r\nthat reform should be carried out without the broadest \r\npossible participation of Member States. Consultations \r\nmust include all States, not just donor countries, \r\nbecause we firmly believe that new methods of work \r\nin the United Nations are especially important to States \r\nreceiving assistance. It is only through joint efforts that \r\nwe will be able to realize our goals most effectively and \r\nin a manner acceptable to all.\r\nIn any restructuring of the Organization, we should \r\nbe careful not to eliminate positive aspects of the \r\nsystem that have been shown to be effective in practice. \r\nWe also believe it is extremely important to avoid \r\nsaddling Member States with additional financial and \r\nbureaucratic burdens, and to ensure that United Nations \r\nagencies are well coordinated and run smoothly on \r\nthe ground, while fully respecting the principle that \r\nUnited Nations activities should respond to the national \r\npriorities of Member States.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s efforts \r\nto revitalize the Secretariat’s peace and security \r\narchitecture. Initiatives aimed at increasing the \r\npotential of United Nations peacekeeping forces \r\nand adapting their configurations as well as possible \r\nto current circumstances deserve broad support. In \r\nthe context of improving peacekeeping, however, it \r\nis important to ensure that the process of technical \r\nreform does not become an end in itself, that we do \r\nnot get bogged down in bureaucratic rearrangements \r\nand that we avoid arbitrarily expanding or shrinking \r\nthe mandates and functions of the key United Nations \r\nbodies. Our joint and, most importantly, coordinated \r\nefforts should result in maintaining peace and security \r\nin vulnerable regions.\r\nWhere United Nations peacekeeping missions are \r\nconcerned, the gender perspective plays an important \r\nrole in improving the current peace and security \r\narchitecture. In that regard, the Secretary-General’s \r\ninitiative to enhance the role of women in peacekeeping \r\ndeserves the high praise. The Republic of Belarus is \r\nno stranger to that concept. The Belarusian military \r\nexperts deployed to the United Nations Interim Force \r\nin Lebanon and successfully carrying out their tasks \r\nthere include women.\r\nWe concur with the Secretary-General that, \r\nalthough progress on development indicators is being \r\nmade, there remain threats that could undermine global \r\nstability. That is a very immediate problem, and we \r\nbelieve that the United Nations should therefore take a \r\nmore individual approach to solving specific problems, \r\ntaking into account the unique characteristics and \r\npeculiarities of every country.\r\nIn our view, it is high time that the United Nations \r\nrecognized the middle-income countries, which \r\nhave still not been factored into the systemic activity \r\nof our Organization and for which there is still no \r\ncoordinated assistance mechanism. We are talking \r\nabout more than 100 countries, which are home to a \r\nmajority of the world’s population. They account \r\nfor a third of the world’s gross domestic product \r\nand a quarter of its exports and imports. Moreover, \r\n73 per cent of all the people living in poverty are in \r\nmiddle-income countries. We hope that the Secretariat \r\nwill help by formulating and adopting a strategy to \r\nhelp middle-income countries achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment, based on the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and on instruments analogous to those devised \r\nfor other categories of developing countries. If we do \r\nnot take the interests of this category of country into \r\naccount we will never succeed in implementing the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nWe would also like to look at various current \r\nprocesses within the United Nations that have to \r\ndo with routine interactions between States and the \r\nSecretariat. States need a clear and open framework \r\nfor such interaction if they are to accomplish their \r\ntasks successfully. Unfortunately, the bureaucratic red \r\ntape in the Secretariat shows no sign of diminishing. \r\nWe continue to see that the Secretariat is simply not \r\nlistening to States’ requests that it simplify the processes \r\nintended to serve them. The unilateral introduction \r\nof new rules to do with the technical aspects of the \r\nSecretariat often seriously complicates the practical \r\ndaily work of States at Headquarters and compels them \r\nto focus on technical and logistical issues rather than on \r\naddressing substantive issues.\r\nThe process for organizing events for States at the \r\nUnited Nations remains cumbersome, and for some \r\nreason we still have to pay for it. The Secretariat’s desire \r\nto divest itself of its direct administrative functions \r\nhas forced Member States to establish a mechanism to \r\nimprove the interaction between the Secretariat and the \r\nPermanent Missions of Member States. The enormous \r\nattention paid to this mechanism during the previous \r\nsession emphasized how increasingly urgent it is that we \r\nA/72/PV.28 03/10/2017\r\n8/20 17-30665\r\nrid ourselves of the backlog of these problems, whose \r\nresolution frequently depends solely on the Secretariat’s \r\nwillingness to react quickly to constructive criticism \r\nand suggestions from the Missions.\r\nWe would also like to discuss the format for \r\nconsidering agenda items, specifically item 110, which \r\nwe are currently considering, on the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization. \r\nToday, as in past years, only Member States participate \r\nin the debate. For some reason, the Secretary-General \r\npresented his report under agenda item 8, which is \r\nthe general debate. In our view, that is quite wrong. \r\nMoreover, agenda item 8 has its own theme, which the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly decides on every \r\nyear. We believe that the Secretary-General should also \r\nadhere strictly to that theme, but he should present his \r\nreport under the appropriate agenda item. Some here \r\nmay say that these are details and this is a practice \r\nthat has evolved over the years, but it is precisely such \r\npractices, where things are winked at and there is an \r\nunwillingness to follow our own rules, that can lead \r\nfirst to indifference, then to misunderstandings and \r\neventually even to conflicts, which all of us would like \r\nto avoid.\r\nWe should not forget that, first and foremost, the \r\nUnited Nations is us — the States. We should not speak \r\nof it as if it were some artificial organism with a life of \r\nits own. Only when we fully identify with the United \r\nNations and feel that it belongs equally to all States, \r\nwith no exceptions, will we begin to talk and listen to \r\none another, and to agree with one another instead of \r\ntrading verbiage and blame. Only then will we succeed \r\nin ridding ourselves of the criticism that the United \r\nNations is unable to respond adequately to challenges \r\nand threats, and make the Organization truly useful and \r\nessential for all who need it.\r\nMr. Matjila (South Africa): I would first like to \r\nconvey our heartfelt condolences to those affected \r\nby the massacre in Las Vegas this past weekend. Our \r\nthoughts and prayers go to the families of the victims, \r\nand we wish those who were injured a speedy recovery.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his first report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/72/1). It ref lects his clear vision and \r\nfirm determination to enhance multilateralism and \r\nstrengthen the authority and role of the United Nations. \r\nThis is indeed an Organization like no other. We agree \r\nwith the Secretary-General that the world we live in \r\npresents a mixed picture of progress, challenges and \r\nopportunities. The United Nations has a unique role and \r\nresponsibility to assist and empower all Member States \r\nand regional organizations to achieve the global goals \r\nthat we have collectively identified and included in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights and the landmark agreements of 2015 \r\non climate change and sustainable development.\r\nThe triple challenges of poverty, unemployment \r\nand inequality are not unique to South Africa. They \r\nare present across all regions of the world and can \r\nbe seen even between States. We need to be creative \r\nin finding ways to establish a more equal and just \r\nsocioeconomic world order to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. As President Zuma noted during \r\nthe general debate,\r\n“The current structure of the global economy \r\ncontinues to deepen the divide between the \r\nglobal North and global South ... Even within the \r\ndeveloped countries, the gap between rich and \r\npoor remains wide and is of serious concern” (see \r\nA/72/PV.9, p. 15).\r\nSouth Africa is committed to working with the \r\nUnited Nations to ensure that our efforts can put the \r\nworld on a trajectory that will enable us to attain the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, eradicate poverty, \r\ncombat discrimination and uphold equality for all. \r\n“Leaving no one behind” should not become an often-\r\nrepeated but meaningless phrase, for it is a call to action. \r\nIn that regard, we note that the implementation phase of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has seen \r\na drop in the means of implementation for supporting \r\ndeveloping countries and a decline in financial \r\ncontributions to the relevant multilateral bodies dealing \r\nwith development and environmental issues. There has \r\nalso been a concerted attempt to shift the burden of \r\ndevelopment assistance away from the commitments \r\nmade by developed countries. South Africa counts on \r\nthe leadership and good offices of the Secretary-General \r\nto mobilize adequate financial support, and thanks him \r\nfor his commitment to maintaining a relentless focus on \r\nthe achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nSouth Africa is continuing its commitment to \r\nensuring respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms and their promotion, protection and \r\nfulfilment. South Africa’s commitment to human rights \r\nand to the promotion of human dignity and equality is \r\nunwavering, and respect for human rights has been the \r\n03/10/2017 A/72/PV.28\r\n17-30665 9/20\r\ndefining feature of its political history. In his report, \r\nthe Secretary-General notes that human rights are\r\n“investments which bring both immediate and long-\r\nterm benefits in building resilience, redressing \r\ngrievance, reducing inequality and advancing \r\nsustainable development” (A/72/1, para. 92).\r\nSouth Africa emphasizes the importance of \r\nthe global realization of economic, social and \r\ncultural rights and remains committed to helping the \r\nOrganization to make concrete and tangible progress in \r\nthat regard, including by drafting a convention, within \r\nthe human rights family of instruments, on the right to \r\ndevelopment. That should be the case for all kinds of \r\nrights, including the right to self-determination.\r\nSouth Africa deplores the ongoing denial of the right \r\nto self-determination for the peoples of Palestine and \r\nWestern Sahara, which is a matter of serious concern to \r\nthe people of South Africa. Those issues have become \r\neven more critical, given the current global instability \r\nand the increased number of conflicts. We are grappling \r\nwith a multiplicity of new threats to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nSouth Africa has long been an unwavering advocate \r\nfor a more deliberate and focused use of United \r\nNations conflict-prevention capacities, including \r\nearly engagement with parties in disputes that could \r\npotentially become violent. In addition, the United \r\nNations should not lose focus once initial stability has \r\nbeen achieved, and should continue to work in support \r\nof finding lasting political solutions. Too often we see \r\na relapse into conflict after initial peace processes have \r\nbeen implemented. With that in mind, South Africa \r\nfully supports the vision of the Secretary-General to \r\nestablish, as he says, a culture of prevention within the \r\nOrganization, including by identifying and addressing \r\nthe root causes of conflict. That is a process that \r\nrequires coordination across the three pillars of the \r\nUnited Nations: peace and security, human rights and \r\ninclusive development.\r\nSouth Africa remains convinced that peace and \r\nstability in the world will remain elusive if we do not \r\naddress the nexus between security and development. \r\nWe look forward to the joint United Nations-World \r\nBank f lagship study on how development and political \r\nprocesses interact for the prevention of violence. We \r\nsupport a United Nations that is agile and able to deliver \r\nresults in complex environments. We look forward to \r\nthe forthcoming report of the Secretary-General on \r\nsustaining peace and holistic approaches to the peace \r\nspectrum. Sustainable peace requires not just changes \r\nto the structures and mindset of the Organization but \r\nalso sustainable and predictable financing for all the \r\nOrganization’s mechanisms across the peace spectrum.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s prioritization \r\nof partnerships with regional organizations, in \r\nparticular the Framework for a Renewed United \r\nNations-African Union Partnership on Africa’s \r\nIntegration and Development Agenda 2017-2027. We \r\nwelcome the continued support for the efforts of the \r\nAfrican Union to resolve conflicts on our continent \r\nthrough the promotion of African solutions to African \r\nproblems. South Africa will also look favourably on \r\nthe proposals for sustainable, predictable and f lexible \r\nfinancing for African Union peace-support operations, \r\nbased on an understanding of the comparative advantage \r\nof African Union missions and the added value to the \r\nUnited Nations. We remain concerned that arbitrary \r\ncuts to the peacekeeping budget will limit the ability of \r\nthe Organization to respond to the multitude of global \r\npeace and security threats and the ability of our troops \r\nto deliver on their mandate.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s commitment \r\nto a universally desired goal of a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nworld. South Africa is pleased that the Treaty on the \r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons has been signed by \r\nmore than 50 Member States, and we call on all Member \r\nStates to join the momentum to prohibit all weapons of \r\nmass destruction. As President Zuma declared during \r\nthe general debate, “there are no safe hands for weapons \r\nof mass destruction” (A/72/PV.9, p. 16).\r\nSouth Africa believes that the United Nations needs \r\nto be effective, efficient, transparent, accountable and \r\npeople-centred. In that regard, we have welcomed the \r\ninclusive and consultative processes led personally \r\nby the Secretary-General, such as the establishment \r\nof the Office of Counter-Terrorism earlier in the \r\nyear. Meaningful reform of the Secretariat requires \r\nownership on the part of the entire membership of the \r\nOrganization. Gender parity and greater geographical \r\nbalance at all levels of the Secretariat are goals that we \r\nshould already have achieved after 72 years. We look \r\nforward to constructive engagement on the proposals \r\nin the relevant committees. However, the reform of the \r\nOrganization remains incomplete as long as the entire \r\ncontinent of Africa is excluded from its most powerful \r\nprincipal organ.\r\nA/72/PV.28 03/10/2017\r\n10/20 17-30665\r\nIn conclusion, South Africa shares the view of the \r\nSecretary-General that\r\n“Multilateralism is not optional. It is the most \r\neffective vehicle, whether regional or global, for \r\nachieving the goals of peace, inclusive sustainable \r\ndevelopment and human rights for all.” (A/72/1, \r\npara. 14)\r\nWe wish to thank the Secretary-General and the \r\nSecretariat for their services to the Organization, and \r\nlook forward to working with the Secretary-General and \r\nall Member States to build a stronger, more effective \r\nand equitable United Nations that will deliver for all the \r\npeoples of the world.\r\nMr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): First of all, I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to express my delegation’s profound and \r\nsincere condolences to the people of the United States \r\nin the aftermath of the monstrous tragedy that recently \r\noccurred in Las Vegas.\r\nWe express our appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his informative report (A/72/1). It is \r\nimportant that it focuses not only on the work of the \r\nOrganization over the past year, but also on the tasks \r\nthat it will face in the future. We share the document’s \r\nkey thought, namely, that the development of the \r\ninternational situation in the period under review was \r\ncharacterized by contradictory trends. In particular, \r\nthe continuing transition to a multipolar world order \r\nhas been accompanied by an increasing potential for \r\nconflicts, the growing threat of terrorism, deepening \r\nlines of division and powerful migration f lows. A \r\nsimilar picture has been observed in the area of \r\ndevelopment. While progress has been made with \r\na number of economic indicators, the problems of \r\npoverty and inequality are becoming more acute, the \r\ntechnology gap persists, climate change continues and \r\nunemployment among young people is on the rise.\r\nOur global Organization has therefore been forced \r\nto take action under difficult conditions, constantly \r\nkeeping its finger on the pulse of the evolving \r\ninternational situation and closely following and \r\npromptly responding to key changes. The Secretariat \r\nand the Secretary-General have provided essential \r\nsupport for Member States in that regard, and we thank \r\nthem for their efforts.\r\nWe understand the need to adapt the United Nations \r\nto changing conditions and new realities. Its reform is \r\nan ongoing process. New institutions and structures \r\nare being established, the agenda is expanding and \r\npeacekeeping is becoming more multifaceted. At the \r\nsame time, some assessments of what has happened \r\nin that regard and certain proposals with regard to \r\nways to move the process forward that are presented \r\nin the report are not entirely clear. Let me focus on \r\nthe following points.\r\nOn the subject of multipolarity, the report affirms \r\nthat the United Nations is the best platform for \r\nuniting the efforts of Member States and civil society \r\nto solve current problems. We support the effort to \r\nmake the Organization more transparent. However, \r\nwe must emphasize that its work is traditionally of an \r\nintergovernmental nature, and it is Member States that \r\nhave the prerogative to make decisions.\r\nWe believe that peacekeeping must not be considered \r\nin an overly broad manner or interpreted as some \r\nkind of new concept or direction in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations. Member States never have discussed, \r\nlet alone agreed on, any action plan currently being \r\nput forward with regard to the broadly disseminated \r\npeacekeeping agenda. Identical resolutions adopted \r\nin 2016 by the General Assembly (70/262) and the \r\nSecurity Council (2282 (2016)) on the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture proposed a unique definition of the term \r\n“sustaining peace”. It is inextricably linked to the \r\nimplementation of peacebuilding efforts and is the \r\nshared task and responsibility of both Governments and \r\nother stakeholders in national processes.\r\nUnited Nations support for conflict prevention \r\nactivities can be provided only in strict conformity \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations, the sovereignty \r\nof States and the leading role of the Security Council. \r\nThe basic principles of international assistance in that \r\nregard are enshrined in Security Council resolution \r\n2171 (2014). At the same time, the chief responsibility \r\nfor preventing conflicts and for overcoming their \r\nconsequences lies with the States themselves.\r\nWe believe that early prevention should not be based \r\non some combination of certain conflict indicators, as \r\nthat opens up opportunities for arbitrary or overly broad \r\ninterpretations. There are no universal or automatic \r\nsolutions to conflict prevention. Each situation requires \r\na sensitive and impartial approach and a patient search \r\nfor a unique solution. We must not forget that many \r\nconflicts have been triggered by foreign interference \r\n03/10/2017 A/72/PV.28\r\n17-30665 11/20\r\nin the internal affairs of States, including attempts to \r\noverthrow regimes that someone disliked.\r\nPeace and security, human rights and development \r\nare unquestionably interrelated to some extent. \r\nHowever, it is important to have a clear understanding \r\nof the fact that development per se cannot guarantee \r\npeace and security, nor can peace and security \r\nguarantee sustainable development. Although they \r\nare related, each United Nations entity must retain its \r\nidentity and functional specialization in order to avoid \r\nduplication of effort and interference in one another’s \r\nareas of responsibility.\r\nOn economic issues, we cannot agree with the \r\nidea that the resolutions of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council must serve as a framework for \r\nhelping countries achieve the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs). One-dimensional interpretations of the \r\nclimate-change process as a cause of mass migration \r\nalso raise doubts and do not reflect existing differences \r\nin the positions of countries on that issue.\r\nThe report fails to mention the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil Forum on Financing for Development, which \r\nis the central platform for discussing development \r\nfinancing and how to achieve the SDGs. Instead, we are \r\nbeing asked to focus on strengthening the Development \r\nCooperation Forum, which does not have a mandate to \r\ndevelop solutions in the field of financing.\r\nThe Russian delegation has traditionally been \r\ncommitted to the multifaceted topics of justice and the \r\nrule of law. However, the report presents those topics \r\nonly as part of human rights. Furthermore, it states \r\nthat when there is a lack of access to justice, certain \r\nsegments of society may slip to violence. We consider \r\nthat to be a one-sided and unreasonable approach. \r\nOther aspects of the rule of law, for example, the crucial \r\ninternational dimension, are not underscored at all. The \r\nsame can be said of the section on drug control.\r\nWe are not convinced that the report should have \r\npaid so much attention to the International Criminal \r\nCourt, a body that is outside the United Nations \r\nsystem. We also do not understand why an illegitimate \r\nmechanism to investigate crimes in Syria is presented \r\nas an unprecedented step. The General Assembly \r\nestablished the mechanism in violation of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and exceeded its own authority in \r\ndoing so. Once again, we call on the Secretary-General \r\nand Member States to renounce all forms of support for \r\nthat mechanism.\r\nOnce again, we express our principled support for \r\nthe Secretary-General’s wish to improve the United \r\nNations. However, given the sensitive nature of any \r\nchanges in that regard, we are convinced that there is \r\na need for clear and rational reform plans and that they \r\nshould be strictly coordinated with all Member States. \r\nIn that way, the call to strengthen multilateralism in \r\ninternational politics and to increase the authority of \r\nthe Organization can be made a reality.\r\nMr. Akbaruddin (India): The report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/72/1) is in many ways an inflection point. It depicts \r\nthe international landscape and the United Nations \r\nitself in a manner that looks much different compared \r\nto just a year ago.\r\nThe euphoria surrounding the finalization of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change seems to have \r\nsubstantially dissipated, even though large-scale \r\nefforts are under way in many States to achieve the \r\nobjectives outlined in those goals. The resentment \r\nproduced by the uneven impacts of globalization within \r\nand among national economies, the anxiety generated \r\nby large movements of peoples f leeing extreme levels \r\nof armed conflict and brutality across continents and \r\nthe widespread devastation at the hands of nature’s \r\nfury, which signal the urgency of climate action, are \r\nall depicted with startling starkness. Threats of nuclear \r\nescalation, armed conflict, massive refugee f lows, \r\never escalating terrorist attacks, endemic poverty \r\nand underdevelopment, worsening environmental \r\ndegradation and climate change, accelerating \r\ntechnological change, all have increased rather than \r\ndiminished the demand for much closer and more \r\neffective multilateralism.\r\nYet the spirit of global partnership appears muted \r\nat best. While we have created a community of mutual \r\ndependence, we have yet to create one of mutual trust \r\nand respect. Multilateralism itself would seem to be in \r\nretreat. The world is clearly in a state of f lux.\r\nThe first report of Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres on the work of the Organization brings out \r\nsuccinctly some of the global challenges we face. It \r\npoints to many of the weaknesses in the United Nations \r\nsystem and makes a compelling case for reform.\r\nOver the past several weeks, the Secretary-General \r\nhas also elaborated some of his reform proposals for the \r\nUnited Nations system. We have conveyed our support \r\nA/72/PV.28 03/10/2017\r\n12/20 17-30665\r\nfor the Secretary-General’s overall efforts to work for \r\nreform. We appreciate the initiative to establish an \r\nOffice of Counter-Terrorism so as to consolidate the \r\nUnited Nations efforts on that significant problem. We \r\nwelcome the push towards a greater gender balance in \r\nsenior appointments. The initiatives to tackle sexual \r\nexploitation and abuse are innovative. The efforts to \r\ndeal with the fundamental fragmentation in the way that \r\nwork is organized at the United Nations will improve \r\ndelivery. Aligning authority with responsibility and the \r\ndelegation of authority to managers at the field level, \r\nwhile changing organizational designs to strengthen \r\naccountability, are proposals that are all overdue. We \r\nappreciate the spirit that imbues those objectives, as \r\nwell as the Secretary-General’s willingness to change \r\nprocesses. We will address those specific issues as \r\nthey are unveiled in greater detail. From a policy \r\nperspective, however, we need to assess whether the \r\nbreadth of suggestions for reform matches the depth of \r\nthe challenges we are facing.\r\nHuman history is, in part, also the story of our \r\nadaptation to new technologies. Today, the gap between \r\nwhat technological advances permit and what the current \r\nsystem of multilateral cooperation is prepared to address \r\nis growing in many areas. Technical achievements, \r\nwhich we believed to be capable of solving all our \r\nills, are actually accentuating our sense of insecurity. \r\nWill the reform being talked about facilitate efforts to \r\naddress that dichotomy? Can we, in all honesty, say \r\nthat the reforms that we are contemplating will make \r\nus fit for purpose to address the challenges posed by \r\nthe furious pace of technological advances in artificial \r\nintelligence, synthetic biology, geoengineering, \r\ndirected-energy systems and additive manufacturing? \r\nCan we say that we are getting prepared through \r\nthe current set of reform efforts to address issues of \r\nglobal commons or spaces that no State controls, but \r\non which all States rely for security and prosperity? \r\nAs the commons — our oceans and outer space — get \r\ncongested and contested, will the contemplated reforms \r\naddress the challenges that those spaces will pose? For \r\nexample, are we able to assess the concerns for “we the \r\npeople” resulting from the more than 22,000 man-made \r\nobjects orbiting the Earth? Cyberspace is just one more \r\nexample of the frontier areas where we remain out of \r\nour depth in multilateral terms.\r\nMrs. Nusseibeh (United Arab Emirates), Vice­\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nSpeaking very evocatively at the opening of the \r\nhigh-level week, the Secretary-General said that rather \r\nthan a world at peace, we have a world in pieces. The \r\naging pillars of a creaking and crumbling post-Second \r\nWorld War order are not amenable to improvement by \r\nminor stabs at modest reform at the margins. If we are \r\nnot to remain prisoners of historical destiny for all time, \r\nand if we are to keep pace with the fast-moving threats \r\nwe face, we will have to go beyond piecemeal changes. \r\nIf not, we will be condemned to global governance in \r\npieces too.\r\nIf we await dramatic crises to force our hand to \r\nget us to address such issues, we do so at the cost of \r\ndeepening the crisis of relevance and performance of the \r\nUnited Nations in particular, as well as the legitimacy \r\nand effectiveness of multilateralism in general. If we \r\nchoose to collectively address those issues as part of a \r\nquest to strive proactively for peace, justice and order, \r\nit will represent a necessary step in piecing together a \r\nsystem that is increasingly seen to be in pieces.\r\nIndia, for its part, stands ready to work with the \r\nSecretary-General and the membership in finding a \r\npathway to a more lasting peace and prosperity for all.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): Let me start by conveying \r\nPakistan’s gratitude to the Secretary-General for his \r\nannual report on the work of the Organization (A/72/1). \r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General’s assessment that \r\nthe international situation is marked by conflicting \r\ntrends. While the international community has made \r\nimportant progress in its fight against extreme poverty, \r\nhunger, illiteracy and disease, the dividends resulting \r\nfrom those gains have been unequally distributed. \r\nInequality, exclusion and a lack of opportunity continue \r\nto blight the hopes and aspirations of millions of people, \r\nespecially women and girls.\r\nAs advancements in communication and commerce \r\nhave made the world more interconnected and \r\ninterdependent, there are powerful voices of discontent \r\ncasting doubt on the very foundations of the liberal \r\neconomic international order. At the same time, \r\nchanging climatic patterns have unleashed nature’s \r\nfury in unforeseen and unprecedented ways.\r\nInternal conflicts and violence continue to \r\nundermine the prospects for peace and stability across \r\nmany parts of the world. Protracted conflicts have also \r\nspawned unprecedented humanitarian crises, if not \r\nemergencies. Already displaced by the ravages of war, \r\ncountless millions of people, including children, have \r\n03/10/2017 A/72/PV.28\r\n17-30665 13/20\r\nbeen forced to wage fresh battles for survival against \r\nfamine and disease. Meanwhile terrorism, which has \r\nmutated into new and more dangerous forms, has yet \r\nto be defeated.\r\nAt a time when international cooperation is \r\nneeded most to address those interrelated and mutually \r\nreinforcing challenges, the world is, sadly, more divided \r\nand polarized. As the Secretary-General urges in his \r\nreport, we must revive faith in multilateralism so as to \r\nface the most pressing, indeed shared, challenges of \r\nour times. The United Nations remains indispensable \r\nto our efforts to restore order and ensure global peace, \r\nstability and prosperity.\r\nJust as the world has evolved over the past 70 years, \r\nso must the United Nations, so that it is fit for purpose. \r\nToday, more than ever, we need the United Nations to \r\nprovide the parameters, processes and platforms for \r\nglobal cooperation that are essential to addressing \r\nour wide-ranging challenges to peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. We welcome the efforts launched by \r\nSecretary-General António Guterres to revitalize the \r\nUnited Nations capabilities for peace and security, \r\ndevelopment and management.\r\nBy the same token, the Security Council cannot \r\nremain isolated from the process of change. A \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council is \r\ntherefore essential, but as Pakistan’s Prime Minister \r\ntold the Assembly last month, the process should \r\ntransform\r\n“the Security Council into a more representative, \r\ndemocratic and accountable organ, rather than an \r\nexpanded club of the powerful and the privileged.” \r\n(A/72/PV.14, p. 8)\r\nWe consider the Secretary-General’s emphasis on \r\nprevention both apt and timely. A surge in diplomacy \r\nis the best response to any threat to peace. Over the \r\nyears, peacekeeping has remained the United Nations \r\nf lagship enterprise for conflict prevention, mediation \r\nand sustaining peace.\r\nAmong the world’s top troop-contributing countries, \r\nPakistan is proud to have played its part in bringing \r\nhope to the lives of millions of people caught up in \r\nconflict and war across the world. This year alone, \r\nfive Pakistani peacekeepers made the ultimate \r\nsacrifice to uphold international peace and security. \r\nOur peacekeepers have always displayed the highest \r\nstandards of professionalism and conduct. Pakistan \r\nwas also among the first batch of countries to sign the \r\nUnited Nations voluntary compact on preventing and \r\naddressing sexual exploitation and abuse.\r\nRespect for human rights is at the core of the \r\nSecretary-General’s call for prevention and sustaining \r\npeace. But peace can only be built on a foundation of \r\njustice. There can be no peace without justice. Yet, \r\nthese universal ideals are being violated, in plain sight \r\nof the international community, in Palestine, in Indian-\r\noccupied Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere.\r\nThe continuing Indian occupation of Jammu and \r\nKashmir is a travesty of justice, law and morality. That \r\ndispute has been on the agenda of the United Nations \r\nand the Security Council for almost 70 years. But the \r\npeople of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir still \r\nawait the implementation of numerous Security Council \r\nresolutions that promised them their inalienable right to \r\nself-determination.\r\nThe Kashmiri people, men, women and children, have \r\nwaged a heroic and popular struggle against occupation. \r\nIndia has used brutal and indiscriminate force to \r\nsuppress the indigenous freedom movement. Hundreds \r\nof innocent, unarmed Kashmiris have been martyred in \r\nthe recent wave of protests; countless others have been \r\nblinded and maimed by pellet guns in what has been \r\nwidely and rightly described as the first mass blinding \r\nin human history.\r\nIndian atrocities in Jammu and Kashmir have \r\nbeen well documented by international human rights \r\norganizations. India does not deny those actions. It \r\ndefends them. It does not express remorse for the acts \r\nof the perpetrators of those war crimes. It rewards them \r\nwith national honours. To cover up its crimes against \r\nthe Kashmiri people and to divert world attention, India \r\nresorts to daily violations of the ceasefire along the \r\nLine of Control in Kashmir. It claims, falsely, to have \r\nconducted a surgical strike across the Line of Control. \r\nThat claim, and India’s repeated threats to conduct such \r\nstrikes across the Line of Control, constitutes a f lagrant \r\nviolation of the injunction against the use or threat of use \r\nof force enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThat gives my country sufficient reason to respond in \r\nexercise of its right to self-defence. By making such \r\nfalse claims and blatant threats, India’s leaders seem to \r\nbe attempting to provoke a conflict with Pakistan. All \r\nI can say to them is that they should not underestimate \r\nPakistan’s resolve and capacity to defend itself. Any \r\naggression or intervention will meet a matching and \r\nA/72/PV.28 03/10/2017\r\n14/20 17-30665\r\neffective response from our armed forces and from the \r\npeople of Pakistan.\r\nNor should the United Nations ignore India’s open \r\nthreats to use force. The international community \r\nshould take urgent action to persuade India to halt \r\nits provocations against my country. The nations of \r\nthe world represented here must not tolerate India’s \r\nimpunity in committing its crimes against humanity \r\nin Kashmir under the f limsy cover of a response to \r\nterrorism. The only terrorism in Kashmir is State \r\nterrorism by India. The brutalization of peoples kept \r\nunder foreign occupation is, in fact, considered as \r\nthe gravest form of terrorism by the Movement of \r\nNon-Aligned Countries, which includes almost two \r\nthirds of the General Assembly’s membership.\r\nPakistan has been on the front lines in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism. Our military campaigns, involving \r\n200,000 of our troops, have crushed and eliminated \r\nterrorist groups in our frontier regions and our towns \r\nand cities. We have paid a heavy price — 27,000 \r\ncivilians and military personnel have been martyred, \r\nmaking the ultimate sacrifice, and many more have \r\nbeen injured and maimed for life, but that does not \r\ndeter us. We will continue until we have eliminated the \r\nlast terrorist from our soil.\r\nBut as we all know, terrorism is now a global \r\nphenomenon that must be addressed comprehensively \r\nin all its forms, including State terrorism. The global \r\nthreat of terrorism cannot, however, be defeated \r\nunless we address its underlying causes. Poverty and \r\nignorance are part of the problem, as are social and \r\npolitical exclusion, foreign intervention and the denial \r\nof economic and political justice. Similarly, extremist \r\nideologies must also be challenged and countered.\r\nFinally, in conclusion, I would like to quote Dag \r\nHammarskjöld, who famously said that the United \r\nNations “was not created to take mankind to heaven, \r\nbut to save humanity from hell.” In the midst of the \r\nprofound and imposing challenges confronting us \r\ntoday, the United Nations remains our best hope to \r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war. \r\nPakistan’s commitment to our parliament of man \r\nis firm and abiding, and we will work collectively, \r\ncollaboratively and together for a better and brighter \r\nfuture, for all of humankind.\r\nMr. Rattray (Jamaica): The Secretary General’s \r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/72/1) represents \r\na tale of mixed fortunes. It recalls the significant strides \r\nthat we have made in several areas and across various \r\nregions. We welcome the fact that millions of people \r\nhave been lifted out of poverty, more children are \r\nachieving greater levels of education and more women \r\nare entering politics. Sadly, those encouraging signs \r\nhave been met with very disheartening developments \r\nthat place our achievements at risk.\r\nThe report points, quite worryingly, to the \r\ndisturbing trends in the increasing numbers of terrorist \r\nattacks, greater inequality and marginalization, and \r\ngrowing humanitarian crises. It provides a list of \r\nvarious challenges that affect us as an international \r\ncommunity and threaten our commitment to leaving \r\nno one behind. We therefore agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his assessment that the Organization has to \r\nbe more productive, proactive, dynamic and nimble in \r\nits approach to many of those issues.\r\nMy delegation is especially pleased that the report \r\nacknowledges the particular challenges that beset \r\nmiddle-income countries. The recognition that large \r\nnumbers of people struggling with poverty live in \r\nmiddle-income countries reinforces our long-standing \r\ncontention that per-capita income as a percentage of \r\ngross domestic product does not reflect the full picture \r\nof the development status of middle-income countries. \r\nThe sense of exclusion of which the Secretary-General \r\nspeaks is real and threatens prospects for citizens to \r\nlive productive and decent lives.\r\nThe Secretary-General makes a timely and \r\nrelevant assertion that the United Nations advocacy for \r\ndisarmament is more vital than ever. Multilateral action \r\non all disarmament and non-proliferation fronts remains \r\ncentral to our common endeavour. That is vividly \r\ndemonstrated by the startling reality, highlighted by \r\nthe Secretary-General, that conventional arms remain \r\nthe predominant means of killing and destruction. \r\nThe report’s consideration of the effects of crime on \r\ndevelopment is instructive.\r\nAs a country challenged by high levels of crime and \r\nviolence, we welcome the ongoing efforts of the United \r\nNations to support national and regional programmes \r\naimed at stemming that scourge. Given the symbiotic \r\nrelationship of crime, violence and drugs, we accord \r\ngreat importance to the Organization’s continued work \r\nin that field. Jamaica remains particularly keen on \r\nexploring the follow-up to the special session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the world drug problem, which \r\nwas held in 2016.\r\n03/10/2017 A/72/PV.28\r\n17-30665 15/20\r\nWe join in celebrating the historic adoption of \r\nthe Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and \r\nshare the concerns about the additional challenges of \r\ncybersecurity, artificial intelligence and the potential \r\nharmful use of outer space, which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral also highlights in his report.\r\nAs witnessed throughout the year and most \r\npointedly during the recent passage of Hurricanes \r\nHarvey, Irma and Maria, extreme weather phenomena \r\nand climate change present real and serious challenges \r\nfor each and every one of us. The devastating impact \r\nof natural disasters on human life and property is \r\nundeniable. The Secretary-General’s strong signal of \r\nhis commitment to responding to those challenges is \r\ntherefore welcome. So too is the work being undertaken \r\nby Member States to draw up an international legally \r\nbinding instrument in the framework of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea to conserve \r\nand sustainably use marine biological diversity in areas \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction.\r\nWe support the focus of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe elimination of all forms of violence against women \r\nand children. We endorse the stance that he has taken \r\nthat the United Nations must continue its efforts to \r\nthat end. We also support the focus on the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights as integral to efforts \r\naimed at preventing conflict and at sustaining peace. \r\nWe underscore that such efforts should also take into \r\naccount all economic, social and cultural rights in the \r\nconsideration of peace as a human rights imperative.\r\nThe joint United Nations-World Bank f lagship \r\nstudy on the manner in which development and \r\npolitical processes interact to prevent violence should \r\nprovide some useful insights into some aspects of \r\nthat dynamic. However, funding will no doubt remain \r\ncritical. The empowerment of vulnerable groups will \r\nremain an essential aspect of the United Nations work. \r\nMy delegation is pleased that that has been highlighted \r\nin the report and is supportive of that approach.\r\nWe read with interest the Secretary-General’s \r\nreference to the important role that partnerships can play \r\nin advancing the work of the Organization. However, \r\nwe would have welcomed a specific reference to the \r\nCaribbean Community in that context, as our subregion \r\nis committed to strengthening its cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn the specific case of Haiti, we are pleased with the \r\nefforts being made to respond to the cholera outbreak in \r\nthat country and welcome the acknowledgement of the \r\nrole that the United Nations has to play in effectively \r\naddressing the crisis. We urge all Member States in a \r\nposition to do so to contribute to the United Nations \r\nMulti-Partner Trust Fund that has been established to \r\nassist Haitians affected by the epidemic.\r\nI conclude by reiterating my delegation’s commitment \r\nto the Organization and our shared vision of a United \r\nNations that is responsive to the needs of its constituents.\r\nMr. Khoshroo (Islamic Republic of Iran): I would \r\nlike to touch briefly on some of the issues reflected \r\nin the Secretary-General’s report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/72/1) that we find noteworthy. As \r\nthe world is witnessing a plethora of complex and \r\ninterconnected challenges, we join the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his assessment in paragraph 4 of the report \r\nthat\r\n“now more than ever, multilateral action is needed \r\nto find effective solutions to this mix of challenges”.\r\nWe also share his concern in paragraph 140 of the \r\nreport that\r\n“multilateralism is being questioned at a time when \r\nwe most need coherent global responses to these \r\ninterconnected events”.\r\nIn a very pertinent case, we would like to reiterate \r\nthat the Iran nuclear deal, as a testament to the value \r\nof diplomacy, should be protected from any attempt \r\nto modify it, as that will undermine not only the \r\nagreement, but also diplomacy and multilateralism \r\nin general. In that context, we renew our call to the \r\nSecretariat to take a more constructive approach to \r\nfulfilling its reporting function.\r\nOn preserving international peace and security, \r\nthe report rightly points out that the adoption of the \r\nTreaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was a \r\nstep towards the universally desired goal of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world. In our view, it also represented a \r\ncollective protest against the almost 50-year violation \r\nof nuclear disarmament obligations by the nuclear-\r\nweapon States. In that context, we also expect it to \r\ninclude the alarming trends of the new nuclear arms \r\nrace and nuclear-arms modernization race, as well as \r\nthe strong international call that has been made for \r\nputting an immediate end to such races.\r\nOn the issue of peacekeeping operations, Iran \r\nbelieves that such operations are the strongest and \r\nA/72/PV.28 03/10/2017\r\n16/20 17-30665\r\nmost effective tools for maintaining global peace and \r\nsecurity, as well as for containing conflicts. However, \r\nas recommended by the High-level Independent Panel \r\non Peace Operations in its report (see A/70/95), Iran \r\nbelieves that United Nation peacekeeping missions \r\nshould not engage in military counter-terrorism \r\noperations, which should be done by host Governments.\r\nThe establishment of the Office of Counter-\r\nTerrorism to lead the counter-terrorism-related \r\nactivities across the United Nations system has the \r\npotential to enhance United Nations capacity, strengthen \r\ncoherence and coordination, and improve internal and \r\nexternal communication. It could also strengthen the \r\nUnited Nations capacity to address the root causes of \r\nterrorism and violent extremism. It is imperative to \r\nallocate sufficient financial resources for the Office \r\nfrom the United Nations regular budget. We note with \r\nconcern that in the new structure, most of the positions \r\nwill be funded through voluntary funds. Moreover, \r\nthere should be sufficient and sustainable funding \r\navailable from the regular budget for capacity-building \r\nto meet the needs of Member States upon request, and \r\nsuch funding should be made available in an impartial, \r\nbalanced and sustainable manner.\r\nAs for the ongoing United Nations reform \r\nconsultation process on development, it is essential \r\nto bear in mind the significance of the alignment and \r\ncompatibility of the United Nations development system \r\nwith the policies, priorities and needs of developing \r\ncountries, with an emphasis on national ownership and \r\nleadership at the country level.\r\nIn that context, we would like to recall the scope \r\nand mandate of the operational activities for the \r\ndevelopment of the United Nations system envisioned \r\nin resolution 71/243. Our region is now grappling with \r\nnumerous human, environmental and social challenges. \r\nAchieving peace and sustainable development in tandem \r\nhas become the Middle East’s most urgent priority. In \r\nthat regard, the United Nations reform process should \r\nhelp the countries of our region to meet their special \r\nneeds and challenges. It is also important that the United \r\nNations regain its leading role in shaping world public \r\nopinion, rather than following biased media trends or \r\nthe agenda of donor countries.\r\nBy way of conclusion, my delegation takes note \r\nof the Secretary-General’s efforts regarding the \r\nreform of the management of the Organization. I \r\nwould like to emphasize that any reform effort must \r\nstrengthen the ability of Member States to perform \r\ntheir oversight and monitoring roles, as well as preserve \r\nthe intergovernmental, multilateral and international \r\nnature of the Organization. We will carefully examine \r\nthe Secretary-General’s reform proposal and actively \r\nparticipate in the consultations on that issue. The world \r\ntoday faces exponentially greater risks, but we also have \r\ngreater opportunities. Let us join hands to confront the \r\nrisks, while appreciating the new opportunities for a \r\nbetter and brighter future.\r\nMr. Sadykov (Kazakhstan): At the outset, we \r\nexpress our deepest condolences to the United States \r\nfor the loss of innocent lives in the massacre that \r\ntook place last weekend, and we wish the injured a \r\nspeedy recovery.\r\nWe thank Secretary-General Guterres for his \r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/72/1), which demonstrates that the United Nations is \r\nthe only global, multilateral platform that can address \r\nglobal issues, threats and challenges. We highly \r\ncommend his courage and commitment to improving the \r\nwork of the Organization and taking it into the twenty-\r\nfirst century. His forward-looking, yet pragmatic vision \r\nand leadership will bring the international community \r\ntogether as we support his thrust to counter global risks \r\nby promoting both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the sustaining peace agenda, the two \r\nkey trajectories of the United Nations.\r\nKazakhstan fully endorses and will work with others \r\non the Secretary-General’s plan for bold and much-\r\nneeded system-wide reforms in areas ranging from \r\nmanagement and gender parity to human resources, in \r\norder to improve the coordination of the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system. We will be actively engaged with \r\nothers in efforts to achieve enhanced accountability \r\nand transparency and to pool our resources to make the \r\nUnited Nations more cost-effective and result-oriented.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s approach and focus on \r\nprevention, using the tool of preventive diplomacy, \r\nis also one of the core principles of my country’s \r\nforeign policy. It was in 1992, soon after we became \r\nindependent, that the President of Kazakhstan, \r\nNursultan Nazarbayev, convened the Conference on \r\nInteraction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia \r\n(CICA), an intergovernmental forum to promote peace, \r\nsecurity and stability in Asia and beyond. We will work \r\ntowards a greater synergy between the United Nations \r\nand the CICA.\r\n03/10/2017 A/72/PV.28\r\n17-30665 17/20\r\nAs the country representing Central Asia on the \r\nSecurity Council for the first time in the history of the \r\nUnited Nations, we will support the United Nations and \r\nthe Secretary-General’s efforts by promoting security \r\nand stability in the region, by fully implementing \r\nthe mandate of the United Nations Regional Centre \r\nfor Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia, which is \r\ncelebrating its tenth anniversary.\r\nCompliance with international law is the bedrock \r\nof national, regional and global peace and security. \r\nUpholding the principles of the national sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of States will thereby prevent \r\nhumankind from repeating the tragic mistakes of \r\nthe past. We therefore underscore the crucial need to \r\nreaffirm the principles of international law.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s initiatives \r\nto reform United Nations peacekeeping and the \r\nrestructuring of its mechanisms at Headquarters and in \r\nthe field, with a view to strengthening the Organization’s \r\nability to prevent and counter asymmetrical conflicts. \r\nWe agree that clear mandates with achievable goals \r\nand the use of regional forces will bring about greater \r\nrelevance, effectiveness and accountability. Engaging \r\nnew contributing countries would reduce the deployment \r\ngap for rapid-reaction emergency responses. We \r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s concept of sustaining \r\npeace by using all tools in an integrated manner and \r\nin parallel. Kazakhstan is committed to supporting the \r\nUnited Nations by enlarging its contribution to United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions.\r\nThe Secretary-General has spoken of the need \r\nto fight terrorism and violent extremism. In June, \r\ntherefore, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Central \r\nAsian States had the opportunity to work with the \r\nSecretary-General in Ashgabat, when he participated \r\nin the High-level Dialogue on Implementing the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in Central \r\nAsia. Kazakhstan will work closely with the newly \r\nestablished United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism \r\nto fight international terrorism through a long-term \r\ncomprehensive approach. We are therefore proposing \r\nthe adoption of a code of conduct for the achievement of \r\na terrorism-free world, which will positively strengthen \r\nregional and global cooperation in accordance with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law.\r\nKazakhstan is fully engaged in fighting the nuclear \r\nthreat, one of the most urgent tasks of our time. The \r\ncurrent year has witnessed important developments, such \r\nas the historic adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition \r\nof Nuclear Weapons, which hopefully will lead to a \r\ntotal ban on nuclear weapons. Kazakhstan actively \r\nparticipated in that process and will sign the Treaty \r\non the completion of its internal procedures. We also \r\ninaugurated the International Atomic Energy Agency’s \r\nlow-enriched uranium nuclear bank to facilitate the \r\ndevelopment of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and \r\nthe strengthening the regime for the non-proliferation \r\nof weapons of mass destruction. Kazakhstan shares the \r\nview of the Secretary-General that the United Nations \r\nnow faces the additional challenges of cybersecurity, \r\nartificial intelligence and the potentially harmful \r\nuse of outer space. We believe that the international \r\ncommunity should take appropriate and coordinated \r\nmeasures to cope with those new challenges.\r\nKazakhstan is deeply committed to all 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, promoting justice and equality for \r\nall and countering climate change. Despite our abundant \r\nconventional energy resources, we are deeply committed \r\nto a diversified, green economy with alternative energy \r\nsources. That sort of thinking led us to choose “Future \r\nEnergy” as the theme for the Astana Expo 2017, which \r\nopened on 10 June and concluded on 10 September. \r\nSome 122 countries and 18 international organizations, \r\nincluding the United Nations system, showcased their \r\nbest solutions for gernerating renewable sources of \r\nenergy and combating climate change.\r\nOur commitment to the objectives of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development is reflected in the \r\nstrategic national legislation and programmes that our \r\nGovernment has adopted, as well as our partnership \r\nwith all countries, especially the most vulnerable, \r\nwhich include the least developed, landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries and small island developing \r\nStates. My country will therefore focus on enabling all \r\ncountries in such special situations to reach their own \r\nvision. Our consistent approach to solving problems \r\nis threefold, consisting of strengthening the security-\r\ndevelopment nexus, taking a more regional approach \r\nrather than a narrow country focu, and establishing \r\na well-coordinated development strategy based on \r\nthe United Nations system, best described as “One \r\nUnited Nations”, with the full engagement of women \r\nand young people and aimed at 50-50 representation. \r\nNotwithstanding the challenges, by working with the \r\nSecretary-General, the United Nations, Member States \r\nA/72/PV.28 03/10/2017\r\n18/20 17-30665\r\nand others, we will see a better future for people and \r\nthe planet.\r\nMs. Hailu (Ethiopia): I would like to start my brief \r\nremarks by applauding the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/72/1). It is \r\nindeed comprehensive and covers all aspects of the \r\nwork of the Organization. It does that succinctly and is \r\ntherefore very helpful for framing exchanges of views \r\namong Member States at a time when the role of the \r\nUnited Nations has perhaps become more critical than \r\never.\r\nLet me say that we agree with the thrust of the \r\nnarrative that underlines the report. Though the world \r\nhas seen significant progress in reducing poverty, \r\nexpanding health and education and improving gender \r\nequality, the current global context presents new risks \r\nfor our hard-won collective progress, as the report \r\nrightly acknowledges. Poverty, inequality, economic \r\nfragility, unemployment, conflict, the adverse impacts \r\nof climate change, governance shortcomings and illegal \r\nmigration are among the challenges that threaten our \r\nagenda, which seeks to create a world free from want \r\nand fear. Hence, two years after adopting the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development with much \r\noptimism, we cannot deny that that optimism has \r\ndissipated. We have to recreate that optimism, because \r\nthere is no alternative. It is therefore crucial to find \r\neffective and durable solutions to the multiple common \r\nchallenges we face, while maximizing the benefits of \r\nglobalization for all. That is how we will realize the \r\nvision of leaving no one behind.\r\nThe multifaceted and transnational challenges \r\nrequire transboundary actions, since no single country, \r\nno matter how powerful, can solve our global problems \r\nalone. Although the world has transformative and \r\ncomprehensive development frameworks, what is \r\nrequired is political determination and commitment \r\nto acting collectively through renewed faith in \r\na more effective multilateralism and revitalized \r\nglobal partnership and solidarity. In that regard, the \r\ncommitments of the 2030 Agenda and the Addis \r\nAbaba Action Agenda, as well as the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change, should be translated into action \r\naimed at eradicating all forms of poverty, mobilizing \r\nsufficient financial and technological resources and \r\ncombating the negative effects of climate change.\r\nFurthermore, the United Nations should be fit for \r\npurpose, so that it can support developing countries, \r\nparticularly the most vulnerable countries, in \r\nimplementing the Sustainable Development Goals in \r\nline with their national priorities. In that respect, we \r\nsupport the reform agenda of the Secretary-General. \r\nWithout underestimating the specific challenges \r\nthat each country faces, it is important to provide \r\nspecial attention to the most vulnerable countries, in \r\nparticular the least developed countries. Meaningful \r\npriority should therefore be given to countries in \r\nspecial situations, with the aim of implementing the \r\nglobal development frameworks and undertaking the \r\nUnited Nations reforms. In that regard, we welcome \r\nthe Secretary-General’s efforts to further strengthen \r\nUnited Nations peace and development efforts in \r\nAfrica. We support the recent agreement reached \r\nbetween the United Nations and the African Union, \r\nand we look forward to the Secretary-General’s report \r\non financing African-led peace support missions this \r\ncoming November.\r\nAchieving inclusive and sustainable development, \r\nas well as building a participatory democratic system, \r\nhas been the overriding policy objective of the Ethiopian \r\nGovernment. By implementing integrated development \r\nstrategies through a participatory and decentralized \r\nfederal approach, Ethiopia has been able to meet most of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Moreover, we have \r\ncontinued to register encouraging results in executing \r\nour current national development plan, the Growth and \r\nTransformation Plan 2015-2020, which integrates the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. In implementing our \r\nPlan, along with reducing poverty through rapid and \r\ninclusive economic growth, we are devoting special \r\nattention to structural economic transformation and \r\nbuilding a green and climate-resilient economy.\r\nWe have made people-centred progress by reducing \r\npoverty, enhancing the well-being of our people and \r\nincreasing the resilience and the productive capacity \r\nof our economy. However, poverty, unemployment, \r\ndeficits in good governance, inadequate development \r\nfunding and the adverse consequences of climate \r\nchange are among the challenges that we continue \r\nto face. By taking lessons from our successes and \r\nour shortcomings, we seek to intensify our efforts to \r\nimplement the Sustainable Development Goals, in \r\naccordance with our specific national conditions. No \r\nmatter what we may have achieved, we are fully aware \r\nthat without renewed international cooperation, we are \r\nunlikely to fully prevail over poverty. That is why we \r\nbelieve in multilateralism, and promoting that objective \r\n03/10/2017 A/72/PV.28\r\n17-30665 19/20\r\nis also in our national interest. We believe that applies \r\nto all countries.\r\nLet me conclude by reaffirming that the United \r\nNations system in general, including the General \r\nAssembly, has an important role to play in advancing \r\nand advocating for the full and timely implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda. We believe, as the report of the \r\nSecretary General underscores, that it is through a \r\ncoherent and coordinated approach that fully embraces \r\nthe three pillars of development that we can realize \r\npeople-centred peace and prosperity for all.\r\nMr. Awad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My delegation has taken note of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/72/1), and I would like to comment briefly on some \r\nof the issues that were mentioned in the report.\r\nWe welcome the report’s discussion of the \r\nchallenges that the United Nations is facing, such as \r\nthe fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, climate change, equality, transparency, \r\nUnited Nations reform, multilateralism and the culture \r\nof early prevention. We also affirm the role of Member \r\nStates in all of the above, bearing in mind that the \r\nUnited Nations is an intergovernmental organization \r\nand that Member States are the decision-makers in \r\nthis body. My delegation welcomes the mention in the \r\nreport of the establishment of the Office of Counter-\r\nTerrorism, because it should enhance advocacy efforts \r\nand the mobilization of resources to expand the scope \r\nof efforts aimed at enhancing initiatives to prevent \r\nconflict and dealing with root causes leading to the \r\nrecruitment of terrorists. We would like to note that we \r\nhave previously expressed our reservations about the \r\nfinancing of the Office by one country — a country \r\nthat is known for financing terrorism — instead of from \r\nthe regular budget of the United Nations. My country’s \r\nexperience in combating armed terrorist groups that \r\nare supported and funded by certain countries is well \r\nknown to all and deserved specific mention in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report, which, unfortunately, did \r\nnot happen.\r\nSecondly, the Secretary-General’s report made no \r\nmention of the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan \r\nand other Arab territories that have been occupied since \r\n1967, or of all the resolutions that have called for an end \r\nto the worst occupation ever known to humankind.\r\nThirdly, the report does not mention the unilateral \r\ngroup of measures that have been imposed on several \r\ncountries, including Syria, by the United States of \r\nAmerica, the European Union and other States in a \r\nmanner that is not in line with international law or the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation strongly rejects a statement in \r\nparagraph 115 of the Secretary-General’s report, which \r\nsays\r\n“In an unprecedented step, the General Assembly \r\nestablished the International, Impartial, and \r\nIndependent Mechanism to Assist in the \r\nInvestigation and Prosecution of Persons \r\nResponsible for the Most Serious Crimes under \r\nInternational Law Committed in the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic since March 2011.”\r\nAs is well known, my delegation rejects that \r\nMechanism, which was established by an illegitimate, \r\nnon-consensual resolution (71/248), full of political and \r\nlegal holes. The resolution was submitted by countries \r\nthat are well known for their anti-Syrian agendas. \r\nMoreover, the Mechanism’s establishment represents \r\nblatant interference in the internal affairs of my country \r\nin a manner that is not in line with the principles and \r\npurposes of the Charter or with international law.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note \r\nof the report of the Secretary-General on the work of \r\nthe Organization contained in document A/72/1?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor to \r\nspeakers in exercise of the right of reply, I would like \r\nto remind members that statements in the exercise of \r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first \r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second, and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Gambhir (India): I am taking the f loor \r\nto respond to the remarks made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Pakistan in the debate earlier today.\r\nEven as we heard speakers address concerns \r\nof the present and the future, we also heard a lonely \r\nvoice from the wilderness articulate a narrative of the \r\npast. That voice focused on an issue that has not even \r\nbeen deliberated on in the United Nations for decades \r\nand that Pakistan tries to keep alive via procedural \r\nstratagems even as the world has moved on. Yesterday’s \r\npeople, reflecting antiquated mindsets of bygone times, \r\nA/72/PV.28 03/10/2017\r\n20/20 17-30665\r\nare symbolic of what holds us all back. My delegation \r\ndoes not wish to waste the Assembly’s precious time by \r\nengaging further in such distractions.\r\nMr. Warraich (Pakistan): My delegation is \r\ncompelled to take the f loor in exercise of the right of \r\nreply to the statement just made by the representative \r\nof India. Despite what some may believe, the repetition \r\nof groundless accusations and fabrications does \r\nnot lend them credibility. They may at best satisfy a \r\nself-delusional notion of reality. But a farce can only \r\ngo so far. Let me recall for the benefit of the Indian \r\nrepresentative that Jammu and Kashmir is not a part \r\nof India. It never was and never will be. It has been \r\nrecognized by the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity as disputed territory. The Indian occupation \r\nof Jammu and Kashmir is therefore illegal. No amount \r\nof obfuscation, diversion, deceit and aggression can \r\nhide that fact.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 110?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Before concluding, I wish \r\nto make an announcement concerning the membership \r\nof the General Committee of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-second session. Members will recall \r\nthat for the seventy-second session, the President, the \r\n21 Vice-Presidents and the Chairs of the six Main \r\nCommittees were elected on 31 May 2017. Subsequently, \r\nI would like to inform members that on 28 September, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mohammed Hussein Bahr Aluloom \r\nof Iraq was elected Chair of the First Committee of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session in \r\norder to replace His Excellency Mr. Mouayed Saleh, \r\nand is accordingly a member of the General Committee \r\nfor the session. I congratulate the Chair of the First \r\nCommittee on his election.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.10 p.m.\r\n"
