"United Nations A/72/PV.32\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n32nd plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 18 October 2017, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda items 75 and 129\r\nReport of the International Tribunal for the \r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious \r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law \r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former \r\nYugoslavia since 1991\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/72/266)\r\nInternational Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/72/261)\r\nThe President: I call on Judge Carmel Agius, \r\nPresident of the International Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia.\r\nJudge Agius (International Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia): It is my deep honour to address \r\nthe Assembly for the second, and indeed last, time in \r\nmy capacity as President of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). At the \r\noutset, please allow me to congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák of Slovakia on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session. It is with great pleasure that I wish Your \r\nExcellency a successful tour of duty.\r\nI must note also that our meeting today takes place \r\nnot long before United Nations Day, on 24 October, \r\nwhich marks the anniversary of the Organization and \r\nthe entry into force of its founding document, the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. I am proud to represent \r\nan institution that has played an active role in furthering \r\nthe principles and purposes of the Charter, and I once \r\nagain reaffirm our commitment to those ideals and to \r\ncontinuing the fight against impunity for genocide, \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. Until the \r\nvery moment that the Tribunal closes its doors, we will \r\ncontinue to reinforce our message to the international \r\ncommunity that perpetrators of such crimes must be \r\nbrought to justice.\r\nBefore the Assembly today is the twenty-fourth \r\nand final annual report of the Tribunal (A/72/266). \r\nThe report details the progress made in the past year \r\ntowards the completion of the Tribunal’s mandate and \r\nthe transition to the International Residual Mechanism \r\nfor Criminal Tribunals, which I will henceforth refer to \r\nas the Mechanism.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, the Tribunal has now \r\ncompleted its work in all but two substantive cases. The \r\njudges heard the final arguments in both cases within \r\nthe past year and have been fully engaged in intensive \r\ndeliberations and judgment drafting since then. Our \r\nresolute determination to conclude all judicial work by \r\nthe end of November 2017 will result in the delivery \r\nof judgments next month, on 22 November for the \r\nMladić trial case and on 29 November for the Prlić et \r\nal. appeal case.\r\nIn relation to the contempt case against Petar Jojić \r\nand Vjerica Radeta, unfortunately, the news is not so \r\nhappy. No progress has been made in that case since I \r\nstood here a year ago (see A/71/PV.44), and the accused \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n17-32745 (E)\r\n*1732745*\r\nA/72/PV.32 18/10/2017\r\n2/17 17-32745\r\nare still at large in Serbia, owing to Serbia’s continued \r\nlack of cooperation with the Tribunal on that matter. \r\nThat is despite my subsequent reporting of the matter \r\nto the Security Council on numerous occasions. Now, \r\ngiven its imminent closure, there is no longer any \r\npossibility for the ICTY to try that contempt case, but \r\nwe will take whatever action is necessary to ensure that \r\nthe accused will face justice, if necessary, even after \r\nthe Tribunal closes down. The ICTY sincerely hopes \r\nthat Serbia will take this final opportunity to comply \r\nwith the Tribunal’s statute and demonstrate a genuine \r\ncommitment to international criminal justice.\r\nMoving on to more heartening news, I can confirm \r\nto you, Mr. President, and to all present that, in line \r\nwith my solemn commitment to the Assembly, the \r\nICTY will, after 24 years, formally close its doors on \r\n31 December 2017. We will have completed our mandate. \r\nOn behalf of the Tribunal and its three principals, I \r\nwould like to thank all States Members of the United \r\nNations and the international community as a whole \r\nfor their enduring support and assistance over the past \r\nquarter of a century. We congratulate Members on their \r\nvision back in 1993 and their dedication throughout the \r\nTribunal’s life, and we encourage them to recognize \r\nthe immensity of our joint achievements. In my view, \r\nthe principal achievement of the Tribunal, and its most \r\nimportant legacy, is its ground-breaking role in the \r\nfight against impunity and the successful fulfilment of \r\nits mandate to prosecute those who bear the greatest \r\nresponsibility for the horrific crimes committed in the \r\nformer Yugoslavia during the conflicts of the 1990s.\r\nAs we reflect on the work that the Tribunal has \r\naccomplished, I recall that the ICTY blazed a trail of \r\ntruly remarkable firsts: it was the first international \r\ncriminal tribunal since the post-Second World War \r\nNuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals; the first tribunal \r\never established under Chapter VII of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations; the first to indict a sitting Head \r\nof State; and the first to have all female principals. \r\nThe ICTY has issued more indictments than any other \r\ninternational criminal court and has successfully \r\nbrought to justice 161 individuals in respect of serious \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law.\r\nAlso, unlike other courts, the ICTY will close with \r\nno outstanding fugitives for core crimes. Numerous \r\njurisprudential firsts have been equally remarkable; for \r\ninstance, the Tribunal was the first to comprehensively \r\naddress conflict-related sexual violence; the first to \r\nclarify the applicability of the laws and customs of war \r\nin non-international armed conflicts; and the first to \r\naffirm that the destruction of cultural heritage may \r\namount to a crime against humanity. On front after \r\nfront, the ICTY has developed not only jurisprudence, \r\nbut also tools, procedures and programmes to address \r\nspecialized areas of international criminal law and \r\npractice, such as witness protection, State cooperation \r\nand judicial efficiency. While the ICTY has also faced \r\nnumerous challenges throughout its operations, the \r\nrecord will show that it has responded positively, indeed \r\nrisen, to these challenges in ways that will be relevant \r\nfor other courts and tribunals in the future.\r\nThe achievements of the ICTY do not begin and \r\nend in The Hague. Not only has our delivery of justice \r\nassisted in rebuilding the trust between the States of \r\nthe former Yugoslavia and the United Nations, but our \r\nnumerous outreach and capacity-building programmes \r\nhave assisted those in the region in putting their \r\ncountries back together. Today, the former Yugoslav \r\nrepublics have adjudicated numerous cases through their \r\nown special war-crimes courts, and their specialized \r\nwar-crimes prosecutors continue to investigate and \r\nbring charges against perpetrators numbering in their \r\nthousands. However, let me assure the Assembly, that \r\nthere is much room for improvement and a need for \r\ncontinued assistance to the relevant institutions and \r\nactors on the ground.\r\nIn order to ensure that the ICTY continues to \r\ncontribute to the fight against impunity even after we \r\nclose our doors and in order to further consolidate its \r\nlegacy, the ICTY has developed a series of legacy and \r\nclosing events entitled “ICTY legacy dialogues”. I am \r\npleased to inform the Assembly that they have been \r\nmet with very positive responses so far. As part of \r\nthat series, the ICTY held a final Legacy Conference \r\nin June of this year in Sarajevo, at which the myriad \r\nlegacies of the Tribunal were discussed with all relevant \r\nstakeholders. As members know, the ICTY adopted a \r\nset of conclusions and recommendations at the end of \r\nthe Conference, which are annexed to the annual report \r\nthat they have before them. We anticipate that they will \r\nbe of use to other courts and tribunals in future.\r\nThe Tribunal has also continued to produce \r\ndocumentaries and short features for dissemination \r\nonline, as well as in public forums in the former \r\nYugoslavia, and has recently launched a lecture series \r\nto tell the stories and share the insights of ICTY staff \r\nand defence counsels over their years of service. To \r\nfurther commemorate our closure, the Tribunal will \r\n18/10/2017 A/72/PV.32\r\n17-32745 3/17\r\nhold an event on 4 December at the Secretariat in \r\nNew York, followed by final events in The Hague, \r\nconsisting of a symposium and a closing ceremony on \r\n18 and 21 December, respectively. It is my hope and \r\nexpectation that many of the representatives of States \r\nMembers of the United Nations will join us in New \r\nYork and in The Hague as we celebrate the Tribunal’s \r\nunwavering commitment and significant contributions \r\nto international criminal justice.\r\nAs we prepare for life after the ICTY, I would like \r\nto thank the Tribunal’s Division of Administration, \r\nwhich, among other sections, continues to play a vital \r\nrole in ensuring a seamless transfer of responsibilities \r\nto the Mechanism, while at the same time taking pains \r\nto ensure that our closure remains efficient and an \r\nexample for other downsizing institutions to follow. \r\nBy 1 January 2018, the Tribunal will essentially have \r\nbeen liquidated, with all but a few residual liquidation \r\ntasks remaining, including dealing with the separation \r\nof staff members whose contracts end in December and \r\nclosing the financial accounts. By then the Mechanism \r\nwill have assumed full responsibility for all residual \r\nfunctions of the ICTY, as well as its extensive archives.\r\nIncidentally, in relation to the archives, the ICTY \r\nhas made substantial progress in the preparation and \r\ntransfer of its paper, electronic, audio-visual and \r\nother records for preservation and management by the \r\nMechanism. That work was done in collaboration with \r\nthe Mechanism in order to ensure that the records will \r\nbe easily manageable after their transfer and accessible \r\nfor posterity. As of 1 October, the Mechanism has \r\nreceived approximately 86 per cent of the ICTY’s \r\nrecords, which will be housed in the Mechanism’s \r\narchives, and the remaining records will be handed \r\nover to the Mechanism by 31 December.\r\nIn these and many other respects, I wish to thank \r\nthe President of the Mechanism, my colleague Judge \r\nTheodor Meron, for his continued cooperation and \r\nsupport as we transfer the remaining functions and \r\nrecords to the Mechanism and navigate our way through \r\nthese not easy and challenging final months.\r\nThe achievements of the Tribunal are the product \r\nof the hard work and dedication of all of the judges, \r\nprincipals and staff members of the Tribunal, who \r\ndeserve to be commended once more. I can only \r\nreiterate that the significant progress that we have \r\nmade since the last report towards the conclusion of \r\nour mandate (A/71/263) would not have been possible \r\nwithout the perseverance, exceptional efforts and \r\nexcellent work of my colleagues, the judges and staff, \r\nand I take this opportunity to openly and publicly thank \r\nthem most sincerely.\r\nNow that we are only weeks away from delivering \r\njudgment in the final cases, I wish in particular to pay \r\ntribute to the staff in chambers, who have been and are \r\nstill working around the clock to ensure the cases are \r\ncompleted on time. I must tell the Assembly that the staff \r\nwho remain at the ICTY are among the most dedicated, \r\nprofessional and loyal individuals I have ever known. \r\nIndeed, many have sacrificed opportunities for more \r\nsecure and lucrative employment prospects elsewhere,so \r\nthat they may see their work with the ICTY through \r\nuntil the end. I sincerely hope that Member States will \r\ncontinue to encourage the Secretariat and other United \r\nNations entities to favourably consider applications \r\nfrom qualified ICTY staff members, especially those \r\nwho have chosen to remain with the Tribunal until the \r\ncompletion of their contracts.\r\nI take this opportunity also to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his unwavering support for the work of the \r\nTribunal since his appointment and for wholeheartedly \r\nbacking the efforts undertaken by the Tribunal to fulfil \r\nits mandate. Similarly, I would like to recognize the \r\nLegal Counsel and his Deputy and their team for their \r\nongoing valued assistance throughout our final year.\r\nAs I stand before the Assembly today, marking my \r\nfinal appearance before it as President of the ICTY, I \r\nbelieve that we can all be extremely proud of what the \r\nTribunal has accomplished since 1993. I, personally, \r\ncould not be prouder of our many contributions to the \r\nfields of international criminal law and international \r\nhumanitarian law, to the region of the former Yugoslavia, \r\nto other courts and tribunals, and, of course, to \r\ninternational justice more broadly. The States Members \r\nof the United Nations can — and should — share in \r\nthat sense of pride because, without them, the ICTY \r\nwould never have been created or given the means and \r\nresources with which to succeed. I therefore conclude \r\nby expressing once more my gratitude to all Member \r\nStates and by wishing them success, courage and \r\ndetermination as they carry forward the ideals and \r\ndedication to justice for which the ICTY, together with \r\nthem, has stood and which the ICTY has shown can \r\nbe achieved.\r\nA/72/PV.32 18/10/2017\r\n4/17 17-32745\r\nThe President: I now call on Judge Theodor Meron, \r\nPresident of the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals.\r\nJudge Meron (International Residual Mechanism \r\nfor Criminal Tribunals): It is my privilege to appear \r\nbefore the Assembly as President of the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. Before \r\nproceeding, I would like to congratulate you, \r\nMr. President, on your assuming the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session. I wish \r\nyou, Sir, every success during your term.\r\nI also wish to acknowledge the invaluable support \r\nprovided by the Office of Legal Affairs and especially \r\nby Mr. Miguel Ferreira de Serpa Soares, Under-\r\nSecretary-General for Legal Affairs and United Nations \r\nLegal Counsel, and Mr. Stephen Mathias, Assistant \r\nSecretary-General for Legal Affairs.\r\nFinally, I wish to acknowledge my colleague, \r\nPresident Agius. As a former President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former \r\nYugoslavia myself, it is a particular privilege to appear \r\ntogether with him in this Hall today on the milestone \r\noccasion of the final report of the International Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to the Assembly \r\n(A/72/266).\r\nA few weeks ago, the world lost a titan in the field \r\nof international law, Professor M. Cherif Bassiouni. He \r\nwas, notably, among the first to call for the creation \r\nof a tribunal to try those accused of grave violations \r\nof international law in the former Yugoslavia, and he \r\nwas instrumental in the creation of the International \r\nCriminal Court. He is, in many respects, the founding \r\nfather of modern international criminal law, to whom \r\nwe are all deeply indebted for his legal wisdom and his \r\nmoral insight. As Professor Bassiouni recognized,\r\n“peace is not merely the absence of armed conflict. \r\nIt is the restoration of justice, and the resort to the \r\nrule of law to mediate and resolve conflicts”.\r\nIt was in recognition of those very principles — the \r\nirreplaceable role of justice and the need to ensure \r\naccountability for horrific violations of international \r\nlaw through the rule of law — that in 1993 the ICTY was \r\nestablished and, a year later, the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). The commitment of the \r\nUnited Nations to seeking accountability when faced \r\nwith mass atrocities has continued apace over the past \r\nquarter century and continues to this day, both in this \r\nHall and elsewhere in the Organization. The Mechanism \r\nwas born of that same commitment to justice and the \r\nrule of law, in recognition of the fundamental need to \r\nensure that the remaining fugitives could and would \r\nstill be called to account, even after the closure of the \r\nICTY and the ICTR.\r\nHowever, the creation of the Mechanism bespeaks \r\nsomething more — a recognition that, with justice, come \r\ncertain enduring responsibilities, which remain even \r\nafter the Tribunals’ final judgments on trial or appeal \r\nhave been handed down. I speak of responsibilities for \r\nvulnerable victims and witnesses who have been granted \r\nprotection to facilitate their testimony, for convicted \r\npersons who are serving their sentences or are seeking \r\nto have them revised, for States and individuals that \r\nprovided sensitive information that is now preserved \r\nin the invaluable archives of the two Tribunals and for \r\nthose communities that seek to ensure accountability \r\nin their own courts for the terrible crimes that were \r\ncommitted in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThose are solemn undertakings. If we at the \r\nMechanism were to fail to meet those residual \r\nresponsibilities, it would be a failure not only for \r\nthe legacies of the ICTR and the ICTY, but also for \r\ninternational justice, risking the unravelling of all \r\nthat has been built over the past quarter century. What \r\nvictims and witnesses would come forward in future to \r\ngive evidence on what they have seen in Syria, in Iraq \r\nor in countless other conflicts if it becomes apparent \r\nthat we cannot continue to provide the protections \r\nthat have been granted to victims and witnesses \r\nwho appeared before the ICTR and the ICTY? What \r\nState would cooperate with future investigations by \r\nproviding sensitive information if we cannot ensure the \r\nsafeguarding of the confidential information that made \r\npossible essential elements of the ad hoc tribunals’ \r\nwork? What quality of justice is rendered in court if, \r\nin years to come, we cannot guarantee that prisoners’ \r\nconditions of confinement remain consistent with basic \r\nhuman dignity?\r\nThe Mechanism’s mandate is indisputably limited \r\nin material and temporal scope, and its functions are \r\nresidual in nature. However, our successful completion \r\nof that mandate is both the necessary consequence of \r\nwhat has already been achieved by international justice \r\nand an essential precursor to continued progress in our \r\nfight to end impunity for violations of international law.\r\n18/10/2017 A/72/PV.32\r\n17-32745 5/17\r\nAs set forth in the Mechanism’s written report \r\n(A/72/261), submitted in August, we have made \r\nimportant strides in carrying out the Mechanism’s \r\nmandate over the course of the past year. In the time \r\nremaining, I will highlight a few of the important \r\ndevelopments set forth in our report.\r\nFirst, since I last appeared before the Assembly \r\n(see A/71/PV.44), the Mechanism has welcomed a new \r\nRegistrar, Mr. Olufemi Elias of Nigeria. I very much \r\nappreciate his effective leadership of the Registry and \r\nthe support that he gives me in my role as President.\r\nOn the judicial front, the Mechanism commenced \r\nits first retrial in June, in the case of Stanišić and \r\nSimatović, and that trial proceeds apace. I am pleased \r\nto report that in the case of Ngirabatware, a bench \r\nof the Mechanism’s Appeals Chamber, as originally \r\nconstituted, was able to resume its work in June, and a \r\nhearing in that case will take place in the coming months.\r\nThe Mechanism’s Appeals Chamber remains \r\nseized of appeals in the cases of Karadžić and Šešelj, \r\nand a hearing in the latter case has been scheduled \r\nfor 13 December. The Appeals Chamber stands ready \r\nto hear any appeal that may follow issuance of the \r\nICTY trial judgment in the case of Mladić, which is \r\nanticipated next month. All the while, the judges of the \r\nMechanism continue to address a variety of requests \r\nand applications, with the great majority of the judges \r\nworking part-time from their homes and offices the \r\nworld over.\r\nThe judges of the Mechanism also stand ready to \r\ntry the remaining fugitives indicted by the ICTR, and \r\nthe Mechanism’s Prosecutor, Mr. Serge Brammertz \r\nof Belgium, is committed to arresting and bringing \r\nthose fugitives to justice. His Office is refocusing and \r\nstrengthening its efforts in that regard, recognizing that \r\nthe window of opportunity will not remain open forever.\r\nIn November of last year, the Mechanism opened \r\nits landmark new premises in Arusha at a ceremony \r\npresided over by Her Excellency Samia Hassan Suluhu, \r\nthe Vice-President of the United Republic of Tanzania. \r\nIn that context, I wish once again to record our sincere \r\ngratitude to the Government of the United Republic \r\nof Tanzania, together with which a shared vision for \r\nthe future has been realized under the guidance of \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nOver the course of the past year, staff in Arusha and \r\nThe Hague have been working together to ramp up the \r\nMechanism’s administrative capacity, so as to ensure \r\nsmooth operations on both of the continents where the \r\nMechanism operates following the ICTY’s closure at \r\nthe end of this year. We remain grateful for all that the \r\nstaff of both the ICTR and the ICTY have done over the \r\nyears to provide administrative and other support to the \r\nMechanism during the institutions’ respective periods \r\nof coexistence, and for the very significant economies \r\ngained through those arrangements.\r\nIn all that we do, we also remain dependent upon the \r\nongoing support and cooperation of Member States. In \r\nAfrica in particular, and in Europe, we have continued \r\nto work with partner States over the past year to make \r\nsignificant advances in areas such as the enforcement of \r\nsentences and the relocation of acquitted and released \r\nconvicted persons, to mention but two key areas of \r\nfruitful cooperation. Simply put, the successful, timely \r\nand efficient completion of the Mechanism’s mandate \r\nwill not be possible without the continued support and \r\ncooperation of Member States.\r\nProfessor Bassiouni once wrote — quite \r\nrightly — that no price can be put on the value of doing \r\nwhat is right. At the same time, however, I am keenly \r\naware that the resources to carry out our mandate are \r\nnecessarily limited, and that our careful stewardship of \r\nthose resources is itself a solemn responsibility. With \r\nthat in mind, we must — and will — ensure that our \r\nwork is undertaken with the greatest efficiency and the \r\ngreatest efficacy and in the most cost-effective manner \r\npossible, including by ensuring that our judicial \r\nproceedings are conducted as expeditiously as possible. \r\nWe strive to continually identify and implement best \r\npractices and technological innovations wherever \r\npossible and to budget responsibly accordingly.\r\nWe also remain ever mindful that ours is a small \r\nand temporary institution, whose functions and size \r\nwill diminish over time, such that, even as we are in the \r\nfinal stages of establishing an administrative capacity \r\nto stand on our own and are entering a period of peak \r\njudicial activity, we are already planning for the steps \r\nnecessary to scale down thereafter. We owe nothing \r\nless to the Organization and to the public interest of \r\nthe international community at large, which, together, \r\nwe serve.\r\nMr. Cheshire (New Zealand): I have the honour to \r\nspeak today on behalf of Canada and Australia as well \r\nas my own country, New Zealand.\r\nA/72/PV.32 18/10/2017\r\n6/17 17-32745\r\nCanada, Australia and New Zealand wish to reaffirm \r\nour strong support for the work of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) \r\nand the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals. Their work accords with our long-standing \r\nsupport for efforts to break the cycle of impunity for the \r\nmost serious international crimes, regardless of where \r\nthey occur.\r\nSpeaking for my own country, New Zealand, we \r\nfeel a special sense of connection with the work of the \r\nTribunals, as we were serving on the Security Council \r\nwhen both the ICTY and the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) were established 24 \r\nyears ago.\r\nNow, as we look ahead to the final months of the \r\nICTY, we can be proud of its achievements. They \r\ninclude delivering justice to victims of some of the \r\nmost horrific atrocities in recent history, the Tribunal’s \r\ncontribution to international criminal law jurisprudence \r\nand international humanitarian law, the prosecution of \r\nsexual and gender-based violence, and assisting with \r\nthe establishment of specialized war-crimes chambers \r\nin the region. The ICTY has rendered justice in the \r\ncomplex criminal proceedings before it and has made, \r\nthrough its outreach programme, a lasting impact on \r\nthe region.\r\nThere have been challenges, but the two Tribunals \r\nleave behind a rich legacy that demonstrates what we \r\ncan achieve when we all work together towards our \r\ncommon goals of accountability and of ending impunity \r\nfor those who commit serious international crimes in \r\ncomplex conflict situations. We look forward to the \r\nMechanism continuing that legacy.\r\nDuring the course of the ICTY mandate, \r\nproceedings have been completed for 161 individuals \r\nindicted by the Tribunal. The Tribunal is working \r\nhard to deliver the judgments in the two remaining \r\ncases on time. However, as we have heard, serious \r\nchallenges remain for the ICTY to complete that \r\nwork. Canada, Australia and New Zealand thank the \r\nTribunal for managing the challenges in fulfilling its \r\ncompletion strategy and focusing its resources on its \r\ncore completion work, drawing on the lessons learned \r\nfrom the earlier closing of the ICTR. We welcome \r\nin particular the practical measures adopted by the \r\nTribunal in providing incentives for staff members to \r\nremain with the ICTY until the end of their contracts. \r\nWe commend the Tribunal for its perseverance on \r\nthat issue.\r\nAs we pay tribute to the significant achievements \r\nof the ICTY, the reports of ongoing and widespread \r\ndenial and revisionism regarding the value of the \r\nTribunal’s work are concerning. The important record \r\nof the crimes and facts established by both Tribunals \r\ncannot be understated. Acknowledgement of the crimes \r\nthat have been established to have been committed \r\nis critical in order to prevent such atrocities from \r\noccurring again.\r\nWe are pleased to see the Mechanism’s continued \r\ncommitment to maximizing effectiveness and \r\nefficiencies, building upon the best practice of both \r\nTribunals. We commend the f lexibility that the \r\nMechanism has shown during the transition phase with \r\nthe ICTY, including through the one-office approach \r\nand dual-hatting of some staff. We welcome the \r\nMechanism’s progress in exploring ways to address the \r\nissue of the relocation of those acquitted and of released \r\npersons remaining in the Arusha safe house, which led \r\nto the relocation of two more individuals in December. \r\nWe reiterate our call for the Mechanism to develop a \r\nprocess for risk-based assessments for relocation and \r\nencourage the Mechanism and States to continue to \r\nwork together to address that pressing issue.\r\nThe cooperation of all relevant States with the \r\nICTY and the Mechanism remains essential for the \r\nfulfilment of their mandate. All States are required to \r\ncooperate with the Tribunals in order to ensure that \r\njustice is delivered. That obligation applies particularly \r\nto the States in the region. The obligation to cooperate \r\nfully with the ICTY and the Mechanism is set out in the \r\nChapter VII resolutions, which also require States to \r\ntake any necessary measures under their domestic law \r\nto implement the resolutions establishing those bodies. \r\nThey include the obligation to comply with requests for \r\nassistance or orders issued. Those obligations cannot \r\nbe abrogated on the basis of domestic-law constraints.\r\nWe therefore urge all States in the region to lend \r\ntheir full support both to the ICTY in the final months of \r\nits operation and to the Mechanism once it assumes full \r\nresponsibility for ICTY functions. While we understand \r\nthat it is important to respect the differing competencies \r\nof the judiciary and the executive, the obligation to \r\ncooperate is binding and cannot be avoided. We also \r\nencourage greater cooperation with the Mechanism so \r\n18/10/2017 A/72/PV.32\r\n17-32745 7/17\r\nas to bring to justice the eight individuals who have \r\nbeen indicted by the ICTR but remain at large.\r\nThe successful completion of the Tribunals’ work \r\nand their ultimate legacy for international criminal \r\njustice is dependent, in large part, on the individual \r\nand collective efforts of Member States. For our part, \r\nCanada, Australia and New Zealand will continue \r\nto offer our full cooperation to the ICTY and to the \r\nMechanism to give practical effect to our steadfast \r\ncommitment to international criminal justice.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the observer \r\nof the European Union.\r\nMr. Chaboureau (European Union) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union and its member States. The candidate \r\ncountries of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nMontenegro and Albania, as well as Ukraine, associate \r\nthemselves with the following statement.\r\nWe thank Judge Carmel Agius for his presentation \r\nof the twenty-fourth and final annual report of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons \r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International \r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991 (A/72/266), which is the \r\nfinal report of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) under article 34 of the \r\nStatute of the Tribunal. We note with satisfaction that \r\nthe Tribunal’s projections concerning the completion of \r\nongoing judicial procedures in the cases The Prosecutor \r\nv. Ratko Mladić, on trial, and The Prosecutor v. Prlić et \r\nal., on appeal, remain the same. We can therefore expect \r\nthe Tribunal to deliver its final verdicts in November.\r\nThe European Union and its member States are \r\ngravely concerned by Serbia’s lack of cooperation with \r\nregard to the arrest warrants issued by the Tribunal \r\nagainst persons accused of contempt of the Tribunal \r\nwithin the framework of the case of The Prosecutor \r\nv. Vojislav Šešelj. That marks Serbia’s return to the \r\npractice of non-cooperation with the Tribunal in terms \r\nof the arrest and transfer of the indictees. The absence \r\nof a verdict against the indictees would constitute a \r\nfailure both for the Tribunal, as the end of its mandate \r\ncould prevent the closure of those cases, and for the \r\ninternational community in its fight against impunity \r\nand for the promotion of international criminal justice.\r\nWe call on Serbia, as a country negotiating its \r\naccession to the European Union, to immediately begin \r\nworking with the Tribunal so as to execute the arrest \r\nwarrants. Full and total cooperation with the Tribunal \r\nand with the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals remains essential. The European \r\nUnion insists that it is necessary for Serbia to cooperate \r\nfully with the Tribunal, including by unreservedly \r\naccepting and implementing the judgments and \r\ndecisions of the ICTY.\r\nWe congratulate all of the bodies of the Tribunal on \r\ntheir activities throughout the reporting period. In that \r\nvein, we thank Judge Carmel Agius for the visits he has \r\npaid to Governments and international organizations, \r\nespecially European Union institutions, with a view to \r\nensuring their support and cooperation.\r\nWith regard to the closure of the Tribunal, we \r\nattach great importance to the unhindered liquidation \r\nof the Tribunal’s assets and liabilities, as well as to \r\nthe transition to the Mechanism. We also commend \r\nthe Tribunal for its positive achievements in terms of \r\nestablishing gender balance among its staff.\r\nThe prosecution of serious crimes by national \r\ncourts in the region of the former Yugoslavia is \r\nessential for the consolidation of the rule of law, the \r\nquest for the truth, reconciliation among its peoples \r\nand, consequently, the maintenance of peace in the \r\nregion. In that regard, the work of the Office of the \r\nProsecutor aimed at cooperating with its counterparts \r\nin the countries concerned and improving the capacity, \r\nindependence and impartiality of their judicial systems \r\nso as to assist them in prosecuting such serious crimes \r\nis fundamentally important.\r\nDespite the progress noted by the Prosecutor \r\nconcerning the prosecution of war crimes, crimes of \r\ngenocide and crimes against humanity by national \r\njudicial authorities in the region of the former \r\nYugoslavia, we are deeply disappointed by the trends \r\nobserved in a number of candidate and potential \r\ncandidate countries to the European Union to deny \r\ncrimes committed during the conflict in the former \r\nYugoslavia and to reject facts that have been established \r\nthrough the Tribunal’s judgments. Revisionism and the \r\ndefence of war crimes undoubtedly represent a threat \r\nto the stability of the entire region. In that framework, \r\njudicial cooperation under international law, including \r\ninternational criminal law, provides an instrument to \r\ncombat such trends and strengthens efforts to ensure \r\nregional stability.\r\nA/72/PV.32 18/10/2017\r\n8/17 17-32745\r\nA few months prior to the Tribunal’s closure, the \r\nEuropean Union and its member States will pay tribute \r\nto the 7,000 employees, as well as the 87 Judges, five \r\nProsecutors and four Registrars, who have worked for \r\nthe Tribunal over the past 24 years. The Tribunal has \r\ncompletely fulfilled the mission entrusted to it by the \r\nSecurity Council, which was to prevent serious crimes \r\ncommitted during the armed conflicts that took place \r\nin the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s from going \r\nunpunished. We would like once again to draw the \r\nattention of the General Assembly to the Tribunal’s \r\ncontribution to the maintenance of peace and stability \r\nin a region that was formerly at war.\r\nMoreover, the contribution of the Tribunal to the \r\nimplementation of international humanitarian law and \r\ninternational criminal law is significant and its legacy \r\nmust be preserved not only for the benefit of future \r\ngenerations in general, but also, more specifically, for \r\nthe benefit of other criminal international criminal \r\ncourts, including the International Criminal Court, as \r\nwell as national courts and tribunals. It is therefore of the \r\nutmost importance that an appropriate implementation \r\nof international humanitarian law and international \r\ncriminal law continue to be the guiding principle of the \r\nTribunal until the end of its mandate.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nwelcomed the very positive outcome of the International \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Legacy Dialogues \r\nConference, held in Sarajevo in June as part of a series, \r\nand look forward to the outcome of the symposium to \r\nbe held in The Hague on 18 December, which will be \r\nfollowed by the closing ceremony for the Tribunal on \r\n21 December.\r\nConcerning the Mechanism, the European Union \r\nand its member States thank President Theodor Meron \r\nfor transmitting the fifth annual report (A/72/261) of \r\nthe Mechanism in accordance with article 32 (1) of \r\nits statute. We welcome the close cooperation that it \r\nhas established with the Tribunal. It is of the utmost \r\nimportance that those two judicial institutions work \r\nclosely together during the remaining period of the \r\nTribunal’s mandate so as to enable the Mechanism to \r\nexercise the residual functions of the Tribunal.\r\nWe commend all the entities of the Mechanism for \r\nthe work accomplished during the period covered by \r\nthe report. We take note of the provisional release of \r\nJudge Aydin Sefa Akay, thanks to which the review \r\nproceedings in the case of The Prosecutor v. Augustin \r\nNgirabatware were able to resume. We call for new \r\nmeasures to resolve that matter with full respect for \r\ninternational law.\r\nWe welcome the work of the Office of the \r\nProsecutor aimed at locating the eight persons at large \r\nand trying them before the Mechanism or a court under \r\nRwandan jurisdiction. We express our gratitude to the \r\ninternational organizations and Governments that have \r\nhelped the task forces established by the Office of the \r\nProsecutor to locate the fugitives.\r\nAs in the case of the Tribunal, we believe that the \r\nprosecution by national jurisdictions of the crimes \r\ncommitted in Rwanda is crucial to the fight against \r\nimpunity. The assistance provided by the Office of the \r\nProsecutor is of paramount importance in that regard.\r\nWe welcomed the inauguration of the new premises \r\nof the Arusha branch of the Mechanism in Tanzania \r\non 25 November 2016. We support the Mechanism’s \r\npreference for maintaining the current premises at \r\nThe Hague after the Tribunal’s closure. Keeping those \r\npremises open will facilitate the transfer of residual \r\nfunctions of the Tribunal to the Mechanism, thereby \r\ncontributing to the effectiveness of the Mechanism and \r\nto its cost-effectiveness.\r\nWith regard to the enforcement of sentences, \r\nwe would like to thank the Member States that have \r\nconcluded agreements with the Mechanism for the \r\nimplementation of the relevant penalties on their \r\nterritory, and we encourage other Member States to \r\nconclude similar agreements. We are grateful to the \r\nAfrican States that have agreed to host released or \r\nacquitted persons on their territory, and encourage \r\nother Member States to conclude such agreements with \r\nthe Mechanism in that area.\r\nThe European Union and its member States will \r\ncontinue to be firm advocates of international criminal \r\njustice, the mission of which is the promotion of the \r\nrule of law, combating impunity and the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. We call on all States \r\nto cooperate with the Tribunal until the end of 2017 \r\nand thereafter with the Mechanism in full compliance \r\nwith their obligations as set out in the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nMs. Kuret (Slovenia): It is an honour for me to \r\nrepresent the Republic of Slovenia in this important \r\ndiscussion. Slovenia aligns itself with the statement just \r\ndelivered on behalf of the European Union. In addition, \r\n18/10/2017 A/72/PV.32\r\n17-32745 9/17\r\nwe wish to contribute to today’s discussion from our \r\nnational perspective.\r\nFirst, allow me to express Slovenia’s appreciation \r\nto the President of the International Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY), Judge Agius, and to the \r\nPresident of the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals, Judge Meron, for their respective \r\ninformative reports (A/72/266 and A/72/261) on \r\ndevelopments within the Court and the Mechanism.\r\nFollowing more than 24 years of hard work with \r\nhistoric achievements and many lessons learned, the \r\nICTY will close by the end of this year. Today’s occasion \r\nwarrants a reflection on the Court’s accomplishments \r\nand legacy. Slovenia takes this opportunity to express its \r\nutmost appreciation to the Tribunal for all its endeavours \r\nand to pay tribute to its far-reaching contribution.\r\nThe ICTY was established in response to a dire need \r\nto deal with some of the most tragic events in recent \r\ntimes. It was established as a unique tool for combating \r\nimpunity through the authority of the Security Council. \r\nThe establishment, functioning and jurisprudence \r\nof the ICTY have all contributed importantly to \r\nenhancing and consolidating international criminal \r\nlaw and international humanitarian law. The Court has \r\nbeen instrumental in bringing about justice and giving \r\na voice to thousands of victims of the most heinous \r\ncrimes. It has inspired the international concept of \r\ntransitional justice and affirmed the critical importance \r\nof outreach activities. Moreover, the Court contributed \r\nto the establishment of facts and the strengthening of \r\nnational capacities, and, importantly, it affirmed that \r\nno one is above the law, not even leading politicians.\r\nIt is therefore not surprising that the ICTY inspired \r\nthe establishment of other international criminal \r\ncourts, including the International Criminal Court, \r\nwhich is the first of its kind. Despite the ICTY’s \r\nnumerous and historic accomplishments, however, the \r\nprocess has not been without challenges and criticism. \r\nA sense of incompleteness remains, not least due to the \r\nfact that not all of those who were indicted were given \r\na final verdict. The lessons that we learned from the \r\nexperiences of the ICTY are therefore relevant in terms \r\nof making further improvements.\r\nGiven the proximity of the Western Balkan region to \r\nSlovenia, we have followed the work and developments \r\nof the Court closely. We remain aware of the persistent \r\nchallenges, including the rise of nationalism. \r\nIntolerance, outstanding bilateral issues and the pursuit \r\nof particular political interests across the region also \r\nstand in the way of needed reform. Sadly, the region is \r\nstill burdened by memories and resentment. Ongoing \r\nimpunity for crimes committed on the territory of the \r\nformer Yugoslavia only deepens that sentiment.\r\nFurther, the growing instances of crimes \r\ncommitted during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia \r\nbeing denied are a source of concern. The revisionism \r\nand glorification of war crimes are indubitably \r\ncounterproductive to the stability of the region. As part \r\nof its foreign-policy priorities, Slovenia is striving to \r\ncontribute to reconciliation in the territory of the former \r\nYugoslavia and stability in the Western Balkan region. \r\nThat is why Slovenia has always resolutely supported \r\nthe work of the ICTY.\r\nIt is our firm conviction that concluding trials \r\nagainst individuals charged with atrocity crimes is \r\nessential for the past to be accepted and responsibility \r\nassumed. This, in turn, is decisive for paving the way \r\nto long-term peace and reconciliation among nations of \r\nthe region. Teaching objective historical truth is also \r\nessential for greater development and stability in the \r\nregion; it is the best way to ensure a better future — one \r\nthat is not burdened with the past — for the young \r\ngeneration. Against this background, Slovenia wishes to \r\ncommend the Court for its legacy strategy. In particular, \r\nwe welcome the idea of establishing information \r\ncentres in the countries concerned. This will ensure \r\nthat information about the work of the ICTY remains \r\naccessible to the public.\r\nSlovenia is pleased that all 161 individuals indicted \r\nfor serious violations of international humanitarian law \r\nhave been accounted for. This is an important aspect of \r\nthe Court’s success. Accordingly, we wish to reiterate \r\nthat full and prompt cooperation with the Court, which \r\nis prescribed by international law, remains crucial.\r\nRespect for and application of decisions by \r\ninternational tribunals cannot depend on political \r\nconvenience. Instead, they should reflect a commitment \r\nto respect for the rule of law. Any other approach would \r\nbe perceived as no more than a deliberate failure to \r\ncomply with the obligations set forth by international \r\nlaw. As the ICTY is slowly winding down its operations, \r\nit will be vital for countries to show a commitment to \r\ncombating impunity at the national level, in good faith \r\nand with due respect for the principles of res judicata \r\nand ne bis in idem. In these efforts, judicial cooperation \r\nwill continue to play an important role.\r\nA/72/PV.32 18/10/2017\r\n10/17 17-32745\r\nJust as the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials form part of \r\nour collective memory, the ICTY will leave a permanent \r\nmark through its normative and non-judicial legacy, \r\nwhich will continue beyond the Tribunal’s closure to \r\ninform the work of national, regional and international \r\njurisdictions. Furthermore, the legacy of the ICTY \r\nwill inform the consideration of such critical issues as \r\nthe quality of judges and the importance of effective \r\ncooperation and financial stability. This legacy will \r\nalso remind us to manage expectations so as to avoid \r\nraising unattainable hopes.\r\nBut most importantly, the legacy of the Tribunal \r\nshould be a pledge by the international community to \r\nthe world that those responsible for atrocities will be \r\nbrought to justice. It should be a reminder to future \r\ngenerations that the most tragic chapters in recent \r\nEuropean history should never be repeated. Slovenia \r\nlooks forward to the completion of the ICTY mandate, \r\nits timely closure and an efficient transition process \r\nto the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals. We remain committed to promoting the rule \r\nof law and accountability.\r\nMrs. Rugwabiza (Rwanda): I thank Judges Agius \r\nand Meron for their briefings on the activities of \r\nthe courts.\r\nMore than 20 years ago, the Security Council \r\ndecided to create the Tribunals to try those responsible \r\nfor serious violations. In this regard, the systems we \r\ncreate always require us to look back and check their \r\nusefulness. It is within this perspective that Rwanda is \r\nparticipating in today’s debate — to see whether the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunals in place have met \r\nexpectations in terms of ensuring accountability.\r\nWhile Rwanda remains concerned that several \r\nfugitives, including the three top-priority figures, are \r\nstill at large, we commend the efforts of Office of the \r\nProsecutor in its efforts to reform and strengthen its \r\nfugitive-tracking unit. Our wish is to see this initiative \r\ngive rise to tangible results. We also appreciate the \r\ncooperation between the Office of the Prosecutor of \r\nthe International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals and Rwanda’s national prosecution office. \r\nWe reiterate our call to States Members of the United \r\nNations to collaborate with the Rwanda national \r\nprosecution office and the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nof the Mechanism to arrest fugitive perpetrators of \r\ngenocide, pursuant to Security Council resolutions, and \r\nurge the Member States harbouring those fugitives to \r\nhonour their obligations under international law and \r\narrest them.\r\nRwanda will limit its observations to the \r\nperformance of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda (ICTR), which was given the mission by the \r\nSecurity Council to contribute to the process of national \r\nreconciliation and the restoration of international peace, \r\nto stating that, in our experience, these objectives are \r\nfar from having been achieved. The simple reason for \r\nthat is that most of the master-planners of the 1994 \r\ngenocide are still at large.\r\nI would like to speak to the issue of early release. \r\nRwanda is deeply concerned at the alarming number of \r\npardons and of convicted masterminds of the genocide \r\nbeing granted early release, despite the gravity of the \r\ncrimes committed, namely, the crimes of genocide and \r\ncrimes against humanity. This use of early release is \r\nin total disregard of the rules of procedure. While the \r\nrules of procedure for the Mechanism for the Criminal \r\nTribunals are very clear with respect to the commutation \r\nof sentences and pardons, the Practice Direction on the \r\nprocedure for the determination of applications for \r\nearly release does not provide for transparency in the \r\nprocess. Nor does it allow for any form of recourse, \r\nas it excludes consultations with prosecutors, national \r\njudges and the Government of Rwanda, although the \r\nrules of procedure and evidence clearly stipulate that \r\nthe Government of Rwanda should be notified of any \r\napplication and request for early release.\r\nIn addition, in cases where those convicted have \r\nbeen granted early release, there are no measures in \r\nplace for ongoing monitoring to guarantee that these \r\nindividuals are not re-engaging in genocide ideology. \r\nIndeed, there is publicly available evidence that the \r\nbeneficiaries of early release by the Mechanism \r\nare now actively spreading genocide ideology with \r\ntotal impunity.\r\nThe International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals does not require convicts to sign statements \r\nindicating that they understand that any early release is \r\nsubject to certain conditions. It is clear that even when \r\ngranted early release or a reduced sentence, a convict is \r\nin no way impeded from continuing to promote the kinds \r\nof divisive, sectarian and genocide ideology described \r\nin the progress report submitted by the Prosecutor to \r\nthe Security Council (see S/2017/434, annex II). We \r\nalso note that the progress report discusses increasing \r\nincidents of denial of genocide, which are warning signs \r\n18/10/2017 A/72/PV.32\r\n17-32745 11/17\r\nthat must not be ignored by the General Assembly, as \r\nthey could undermine the great strides that have been \r\nmade in past decades towards ending impunity for war \r\ncrimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to point out that, with respect \r\nto monitoring cases referred to national courts, we note \r\nwith regret from the Prosecutor’s reports that no action \r\nhas been taken by several countries in the 10 years that \r\nthey have had cases referred to them. Repeated delays \r\nin proceedings in cases referred by the ICTR, now \r\nthe Mechanism, are tantamount to a denial of justice \r\nand make it difficult for these institutions’ stated \r\ncommitment to international justice and the protection \r\nof all human rights, including the right to justice, to \r\nbe credible.\r\nMr. Backović (Serbia): It is my honour to address \r\nthe General Assembly today as the representative of \r\nthe Republic of Serbia. I would like to welcome Judge \r\nCarmel Agius, President of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), and Judge \r\nTheodor Meron, President of the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals, and thank them for \r\ntheir annual reports (A/72/266 and A/72/261).\r\nThe common goals of Member States related to \r\nthe key principles of international criminal law and \r\ninternational humanitarian law have led, inter alia, to \r\nthe establishment of two main tracks to fight against \r\nimpunity for the most serious international crimes. \r\nFirst, Member States renounce a significant part of their \r\ncompetencies with regard to the prosecution of war \r\ncrimes in favour of international criminal tribunals. \r\nSecondly, they work to establish and improve the \r\nquality of special mechanisms in their national judicial \r\nsystems so as to strengthen them, leading thereby to the \r\nefficient prosecution of war crimes.\r\nEfforts made by individual States to achieve \r\ntangible results on both tracks are not always equally \r\nfruitful, but they are also not always judged equitably. \r\nThe same is true of the assessment of the ICTY’s efforts \r\nwhen its results are compared to those of individual \r\nStates. However, if we take note of the steps taken to \r\ndate by Serbia to date in this regard, it is hard to deny \r\nthe fact that Serbia is probably the only country that \r\nhas successfully fulfilled its roles on the two tracks \r\nrelated to prosecuting war crimes, in particular serious \r\ninternational crimes. In other words, Serbia is second \r\nto none when it comes to the prosecution of war crimes \r\nand its cooperation with the ICTY.\r\nWith respect to the obligation to cooperate with the \r\nICTY, Serbia has fully complied at both the legislative \r\nand implementation levels. Our criminal legislation is \r\nfully aligned with relevant standards, which allows us \r\ntoo cooperate with the ICTY without exception in terms \r\nof all acts that the Security Council recognized in the \r\nICTY Statute as serious international crimes. Based \r\non this legislation, Serbia has proved its commitment, \r\nwhich is seen in the number and rank of defendants who \r\nhave been surrendered to the ICTY.\r\nThe Republic of Serbia has handed over to the \r\nTribunal 45 of the total of 46 defendants whose \r\nsurrender was demanded from Serbia. One defendant \r\ncommitted suicide before he could be handed over to \r\nthe Tribunal. We are therefore speaking about 100 per \r\ncent compliance. Of the 45 defendants turned over, 14 \r\nwere arrested in Serbia, 4 were arrested abroad within \r\nthe framework of cooperation among national security \r\nservices and foreign agencies, and 27 defendants \r\nvoluntarily surrendered.\r\nIn addition to numbers, I must point out the rank of \r\nthe persons surrendered. Almost all of them were highly \r\nranked officials. Some even occupied leading positions \r\nin the Serbian army and the executive branch of the \r\nAdministration. This shows that Serbia has cooperated \r\nwith the ICTY without compromise. I am not sure that \r\nthe same could be said about any other State.\r\nIn addition, Serbia provided the ICTY Prosecutor \r\nwith free access to important evidence located in \r\nSerbia, such as documents, archives and witnesses. To \r\ndate, Serbia has positively resolved all 2,183 requests \r\nfor assistance received from the Offices of the ICTY. \r\nIn addition, all 2,172 requests we received from the \r\nOffice of the ICTY Prosecutor have been granted. \r\nSerbia allowed 759 witnesses to testify freely despite \r\nthe rights or obligations they had to withhold testimony \r\non the grounds that State, military or official secrets \r\nwere involved. Another 1,338 requests were made by \r\nvarious defence teams to the Serbian authorities; none \r\nof these requests for assistance remain pending, nor are \r\nthey any outstanding disputes.\r\nSerbia carried out all 11 requests for witness \r\nprotection. Furthermore, Government agencies \r\nsuccessfully monitored all provisional release cases and \r\nensured that all the accused were returned to detention \r\nunder ICTY supervision upon request. Currently, the \r\nSerbian authorities are monitoring only one case of \r\nprovisional release.\r\nA/72/PV.32 18/10/2017\r\n12/17 17-32745\r\nWith respect to the other track, Serbia has \r\ncontinuously worked to improve its national judicial \r\nsystem, in line with the strategic course provided in the \r\nAction Plan for Chapter 23 and the national strategy \r\nfor the prosecution of war crimes adopted by the \r\nGovernment in 2016. To streamline reform processes, the \r\nSerbian Government recently established a monitoring \r\nmechanism to closely oversee the implementation of \r\nthe national strategy. The mechanism is coordinated by \r\na working group headed by the Minister of Justice and \r\nthe newly elected War Crimes Prosecutor. We believe \r\nthat the mechanism will make a significant contribution \r\nto the dynamics of reform.\r\nIn parallel, Serbian authorities are working on \r\nstrengthening the capacities of the Office of the War \r\nCrimes Prosecutor. Two indictments for war crimes \r\nagainst six individuals were issued in Serbia in 2016. \r\nSome 420 cases are currently under review by the War \r\nCrimes Prosecutor and awaiting a decision as to whether \r\nthey will be prosecuted. The monitoring of war-crimes-\r\ntrial proceedings by the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe’s Mission to Serbia and civil-\r\nsociety organizations remains ongoing, and special \r\ntraining is being provided to judges, public prosecutors \r\nand police officers participating in the investigation \r\nand prosecution of war crimes. The Ministry of Justice \r\nrecently completed comprehensive analysis activities in \r\npreparation for the drafting and adoption of the new \r\nnational strategy to improve the situation of victims \r\nand witnesses.\r\nWe fully support the comments made in the \r\nICTY report on the importance of reconciliation and \r\ncooperation in the region, and our commitment to this \r\nidea is made clear in the statistical data on regional \r\ncooperation. According to statistics from the Office of \r\nthe War Crimes Prosecutor, in 2017, Serbia resolved 32 \r\nout of 50 requests from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ten \r\nrequests were denied, while eight are still pending. Six \r\nout of 15 requests from Croatia have been resolved; none \r\nwere denied, but nine are still pending. Meanwhile, \r\nonly 16 out of 30 Serbian requests have been positively \r\nresolved by Bosnia and Herzegovina. The results are \r\neven worse with respect to the requests for assistance \r\nthat we submitted to Croatia — only two out of nine \r\nrequests have been positively resolved.\r\nDespite all the facts that prove Serbia’s commitment \r\nto the efficient and non-selective prosecution of war \r\ncrimes, there are unfortunately some parts of the ICTY \r\nProsecutor’s report contained in S/2017/436 that go \r\nsignificantly beyond the facts, the law and even the \r\nbasic rule of law and principles of democratic society. \r\nIn this report, in the case of Prosecutor v. Petar Jojić \r\net al., the Serbian obligation to respect the decisions \r\nof independent Serbian courts is seen as an absence of \r\npolitical will to cooperate with the ICTY.\r\nThe Jojić case is one of contempt of court. It is not \r\na war-crime case, nor is it a case of an alleged serious \r\nwar crime; rather, it is a case of contempt of court for \r\nthe alleged intimidation of witnesses. Serbian courts \r\nruled that these indictees could not be extradited to the \r\nICTY, as that is not provided for in Serbian law. The \r\nrelevant Serbian law is a word-for-word translation of \r\nICTY Statute. Therefore, not only does Serbian law \r\nnot provide for extradition of persons who were not \r\nindicted for serious war crimes, but the ICTY Statute \r\nalso clearly excludes extradition for alleged crimes that \r\nare not serious war crimes. I ask everyone present to \r\nplease read the Statute, or better yet, have their lawyers \r\nread the Statute.\r\nWhy does the Statute not provide for the type of \r\nextradition that is being sought by the Tribunal? There \r\nare two possibilities. First, this type of extradition \r\nmay have intentionally not been provided for, which is \r\nmost likely, given that the Statute explicitly provides \r\nfor the extradition of only those accused of serious war \r\ncrimes. In other words, if the Statute does not provide \r\nfor extradition for those accused of crimes other than \r\nserious war crimes, then, naturally, it will not provide \r\nfor the extradition of people indicted or accused of \r\nlesser, ancillary crimes; that much is obvious. Secondly, \r\npursuant to the explanation proffered by the ICTY, if the \r\ndrafters of the Statute had in fact intended to provide \r\nfor the extradition of indictees for crimes other than \r\nserious war crimes, their failure to actually do so was \r\na substantial error on their part. If they had wanted to \r\nprovide for such extradition in the Statute, they should \r\nhave put it in the Statute.\r\n Regardless of which of these hypothetical \r\nexplanations is accurate, it is simply erroneous to now \r\nrequire the Serbian Government to fix the problem \r\nor mistake. It is equally wrong to label the Serbian \r\nGovernment’s adherence to the rule of law in this \r\ncase as a lack of political will. I submit to the General \r\nAssembly that the rule of law cannot be advanced by \r\nviolating the rule of law.\r\nThe ICTY has completed its operations, but I am \r\nnot sure that it can be said that it has accomplished \r\n18/10/2017 A/72/PV.32\r\n17-32745 13/17\r\nits mission. In my foregoing remarks, I have briefly \r\ndescribed the steps that Serbia has taken to deal with \r\nwar crimes. However, if we apply the same criteria \r\nused to assess Serbia to assess the ICTY’s results, \r\nI would say that the outcome could be negative, in \r\nterms of the average length of proceedings, the lack \r\nof respect for procedural guarantees for the accused, \r\nand the national character of defendants, decisions \r\nand sentences. However, none of this will influence \r\nSerbia’s commitment to the non-selective prosecution \r\nof war crimes.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize once \r\nagain the indisputable need for us to work together on \r\npromoting the basic values and common understanding \r\nof future cooperation and reconciliation in the region. \r\nWithout further challenging the ICTY results in this \r\nregard, I believe that the milestone of future regional \r\nstability should be reached through the efforts of \r\nindividual countries in the region, as well as in their \r\nactive, open and constructive dialogue and cooperation.\r\nMr. Arrocha Olabuenaga (Mexico) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): Mexico expresses its appreciation to \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia for the valuable work that it has carried out \r\nduring its 24 years of operation. As the first ad hoc \r\ninternational criminal tribunal created by the Security \r\nCouncil under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, the Tribunal is undoubtedly a landmark, \r\nhistoric achievement. Its jurisprudence has greatly \r\ncontributed to the interpretation and development of \r\ninternational criminal law, which for four decades had \r\nrelied exclusively on the legacies of the Nuremberg and \r\nthe Far East tribunals.\r\nThe rulings of the Tribunal have set precedents that \r\nare used in the work of the other international and hybrid \r\ncriminal tribunals that were subsequently established, \r\nincluding, of course, the International Criminal \r\nCourt. The fact that the Tribunal has succeeded in \r\nthe investigation and prosecution of the 161 indicted \r\nindividuals and that there are no remaining fugitives is \r\na clear success story that serves as an example for all \r\ntribunals to come.\r\nMexico commends the efforts undertaken by the \r\nTribunal to complete its work and fulfil its mandate \r\nby the end of 2017, in full respect of procedural \r\nguarantees and the rights of the defendants to a fair \r\ntrial. We also commend the Tribunal’s efforts aimed \r\nat ensuring the timely and effective transfer of its \r\nfunctions to the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals.\r\nMexico participated actively in the negotiations \r\ntowards and, since 2010, has supported the establishment \r\nof the Residual Mechanism. We welcome the progress \r\nthat the Mechanism has made so far. We recognize that \r\nits work is essential, not only to complete the residual \r\njudicial tasks of the predecessor Tribunals, including \r\nappeals and the ongoing protection of witnesses and \r\nvictims, but also to preserve and disseminate the \r\nvaluable international criminal law legacy that the \r\nTribunals have left behind.\r\nFinally, beyond welcoming the progress made by \r\nthe Tribunals and the Mechanism, Mexico wishes to \r\nreiterate its full commitment to fighting impunity for \r\nthe most serious international crimes of international \r\nconcern and to international criminal justice in general.\r\nMs. Sapag Muñoz de la Peña (Chile) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Once again, Chile welcomes the outstanding \r\nwork that has been carried out by the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) \r\nand the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals. Their firm commitment to concluding \r\npending proceedings expeditiously and in accordance \r\nwith the rules of due process has been clearly reflected \r\nin the briefings of their respective presidents, Judge \r\nCarmel Agius and Judge Theodor Meron, and in \r\ntheir annual reports (A/72/266 and A/72/261), all of \r\nwhich my delegation has followed with great interest \r\nand attention.\r\nIn this crucial year for the fulfilment of the \r\nTribunal’s completion strategy, Chile welcomes the \r\nsolid progress made towards this end, with only two \r\ncases left for deliberation in November. We regret, \r\nhowever, that the repeated calls for greater international \r\ncooperation in situations where the Office of the \r\nProsecutor had alleged State inaction for the failure \r\nto execute arrest warrants that had been issued by the \r\nTribunal, have gone unheeded. Full cooperation with \r\nthe Tribunal and its officials remains essential. We \r\nwish to express particular appreciation for the Legacy \r\nDialogues, which represent an additional effort aimed \r\nat bringing the Tribunal’s work closer to the region that \r\ninspired its establishment and to publicly embody the \r\nachievements in terms of due accountability, the end \r\nof impunity and the progressive development of norms \r\nthat shape international law.\r\nA/72/PV.32 18/10/2017\r\n14/17 17-32745\r\nWith regard to the Residual Mechanism and its \r\ntwo branches — in Arusha and The Hague — Chile \r\nwelcomes the fulfilment of the many tasks aimed at \r\neffectively and efficiently resolving the outstanding \r\nissues arising from the completion strategy of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the \r\nformer Yugoslavia. In particular, we acknowledge and \r\nshare the priorities that the Office of the Prosecutor has \r\nput in place to complete the proceedings that remain \r\nopen, locate and arrest the eight fugitives sentenced by \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and \r\nassist national jurisdictions in prosecuting international \r\ncrimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.\r\nPreserving the legacy of the International Criminal \r\nTribunals and the Mechanism is a current challenge \r\nof concern to the entire international community. \r\nThrough this legacy, the architecture of international \r\njustice is strengthened, making it vital for other courts \r\nand tribunals, particularly the International Criminal \r\nCourt, which considers the Rwanda and Yugoslavia \r\nTribunals to be affiliated bodies that we are called \r\nto respect and promote in the fight against the most \r\nserious crimes and to bring about an end to impunity.\r\nFinally, I would like to reiterate what a privilege \r\nit was for Chile to lead the Security Council Informal \r\nWorking Group on International Tribunals during \r\nthe biennium 2014-2015, which we took over from \r\nGuatemala and passed on to Uruguay, which now \r\nchairs the Working Group. It is with gratitude and the \r\nconviction that goes with recognizing the importance \r\nof this chapter in the history of international justice \r\nthat my country congratulates everyone involved in this \r\npraiseworthy task.\r\nMr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We thank the leadership of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) \r\nand the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals for their reports on the activities of these \r\nbodies, submitted to the General Assembly on a yearly \r\nbasis (A/72/266 and A/72/261).\r\nWe welcome the commitment expressed by the \r\nleadership of the ICTY to completing all trials at the \r\nTribunal and closing it by the end of 2017. As we all \r\nknow, this should have happened in 2010. However, this \r\ndeadline — and others mentioned in resolution 2329 \r\n(2016) — were, unfortunately, missed.\r\nToday’s meeting ends our discussion of the \r\nTribunal’s reports in the General Assembly. We take \r\nnote of the efforts made by the leadership of the \r\nTribunal to prevent any postponements and to announce \r\npending decisions in November, as scheduled. Despite \r\nthe open contempt case commenced by the Tribunal \r\nin the context of the completed trial of Vojislav Šešelj, \r\nwe believe this should not influence the course of the \r\nclosure of the ICTY.\r\nThe report of the ICTY touches upon the issue of \r\nthe legacy of the Tribunal. Once again, the results of the \r\nwork of the Tribunal have yet to be impartially analysed, \r\nnot only in terms of the convictions and acquittals \r\nit handed down, but also in terms of the genuine \r\nimpact it has had on the processes of reconciliation \r\nand restoration of confidence among the peoples of \r\nthe former Yugoslavia. Given the problems that have \r\nbeen accumulating within the Tribunal for years, we \r\ndo not think that the assessment will be unequivocally \r\npositive. Our position on this issue has been voiced \r\nrepeatedly, and we believe that serious f laws in the \r\nTribunal’s functioning over an extended period will \r\ncontinue to have a negative impact on the prospects for \r\ninternational criminal justice. We hope that the ICTY’s \r\nactivities during its final stretch will not give us new \r\nreasons to be critical of it.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the appeal of the verdict \r\nin the case of The Prosecutor v. Augustin Ngirabatware \r\nwas placed on the docket of the Residual Mechanism. \r\nWe hope that information about the expected duration \r\nof this and other legal proceedings in the Residual \r\nMechanism will be set forth more substantively in a \r\nfuture report.\r\nWe have also read the sections of the report devoted \r\nto the activities of the Residual Mechanism in terms \r\nof capacity-building for national judicial bodies that \r\nconduct criminal prosecution in war-crimes cases. \r\nWe noted the truly global nature of efforts made by \r\nthe Prosecutors in this area. Work is being done in \r\ncountries that have nothing to do with the situations \r\ncurrently under review by the ICTY and the Residual \r\nMechanism. We hope that such activity is not being paid \r\nfor out of the United Nations budget. In any event, we \r\ndoubt the appropriateness of the Residual Mechanism \r\ntraining prosecutors and advertising its own successes.\r\nIn this regard, I would again like to recall that, \r\npursuant to resolution 1966 (2010), the Residual \r\nMechanism is a temporary entity with a clearly \r\ndelineated mandate; it is not a new international court. \r\nWe therefore call for strict observance of this Security \r\n18/10/2017 A/72/PV.32\r\n17-32745 15/17\r\nCouncil resolution. We expect the Residual Mechanism \r\nnot to be distracted by tasks outside its mandate. Rather, \r\nit should focus on closing the cases that will have been \r\nreferred to it following the closure of the ICTY and on \r\nensuring maximum efficiency in legal proceedings, \r\nincluding the length of trials.\r\nMr. García Reyes (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe are grateful for the presentation of the twenty-\r\nfourth annual report of the International Tribunal for \r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious \r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law \r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia \r\nsince 1991 (A/72/266), which we understand to be the \r\nlast annual report of the Tribunal before its closure, \r\nwhich is scheduled for 31 December.\r\nMy delegation has noted how the Tribunal has \r\ncontinued to make significant progress in finalizing its \r\ncompletion strategy. We also note that the 161 persons \r\naccused of serious violations of international law have \r\nalready been tried, leaving only two substantive cases. \r\nWe welcome the fact that both cases have advanced at \r\nan appropriate pace to be able to issue the respective \r\nrulings before 30 November. We also commend the \r\nefforts of judges and staff aimed at fulfilling all of the \r\nTribunal’s responsibilities in a punctual manner.\r\nWe would like to add that Guatemala has welcomed \r\nthe fact that in addition to carrying out judicial functions, \r\nthe Tribunal’s liquidation efforts have remained a \r\npriority, and, in fact, its pace has accelerated during the \r\nperiod covered by the report before us, which shows \r\nthat the Tribunal is resolved to carry out the liquidation \r\nprocess smoothly and successfully. As part of those \r\nactivities, we are pleased to note that the twenty-fourth \r\nannual report outlines the Tribunal’s activities for the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2016 to 31 July 2017 and shows that \r\neach body of the Tribunal continued to take measures \r\nto complete its mandate by the end of this year, not only \r\nwith regard to the conclusion of judicial proceedings, \r\nbut also focusing on the need for an efficient liquidation \r\nprocess and a smooth transition to the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals.\r\nGuatemala wishes to thank the President of the \r\nTribunal and its other officials for what is contained \r\nin the report and for the environment on the ground as \r\nthey leave the field. Each of them took full advantage \r\nof every opportunity to strengthen the Tribunal’s image \r\ninside and outside of the former Yugoslavia, through \r\ntheir Legacy Dialogues and in all the steps they are \r\ntaking with regard to the legacy the Tribunal will \r\nleave behind.\r\nWe also wish to emphasize that the Tribunal’s \r\nlessons are relevant in terms of what can be expected \r\nfrom other international criminal tribunals and courts. \r\nAccordingly, expectations must be managed from the \r\noutset so as not to forget the victims and communities \r\naffected. If possible, the judgments of the Tribunal \r\nshould be integrated into the jurisprudence of the \r\nnational courts of the former Yugoslavia, so that the \r\nnational courts and tribunals of each State are involved \r\nin the efforts to strengthen local civil-society initiatives \r\nwith respect to accountability and reconciliation.\r\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia has demonstrated that it is necessary and \r\npossible to prosecute high-impact cases, including \r\ncases of sexual and gender-based violence. The Tribunal \r\nmust ensure that the citizens of the region have at their \r\ndisposal — and in all local languages — a permanent \r\nrecord of the crimes committed during the conflict in \r\nthe Balkans so that such atrocities do not recur. It is \r\nalso necessary for the national authorities in each State \r\nof the former Yugoslavia, as well as members of civil \r\nsociety and the United Nations, not to forget — and we \r\nshould not forget — reparations and the memory of the \r\nvictims, with a view to providing justice, improving the \r\npenal systems and preventing crimes against humanity \r\nin future.\r\nFinally, we call upon all interested and involved \r\nStates to cooperate fully with the Tribunal and its \r\nofficials, as well as to abide by and comply with the \r\norders it issues, so that it can fully complete its functions \r\nas befits such an important Tribunal.\r\nMr. Trujillo (United States of America): As we \r\nlook to the near horizon in December and see the \r\ncoming closure of the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the United States \r\nagain extends its sincere appreciation to President \r\nMeron, President Agius and Prosecutor Brammertz for \r\ntheir ongoing work to achieve justice for victims of the \r\nvicious atrocities committed in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nIt is especially important to be here today \r\nparticipating in this debate, as we continue to face \r\nconflicts where serious crimes have been committed. \r\nWe must continue to find ways to uphold accountability \r\nfor perpetrators of atrocities and justice for the victims. \r\nAs we look to the closure of the ICTY in December, \r\nwe remain as committed as ever to the Tribunal, the \r\nA/72/PV.32 18/10/2017\r\n16/17 17-32745\r\nindependence of its work and the successful transfer of \r\nfunctions to the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals.\r\nThe United States wishes to underscore that while \r\nthe ICTY is successfully concluding its mandate, \r\nthere remains much to do in pursuit of justice and \r\nreconciliation. We must now turn our focus from \r\nfulfilling national-level obligations to resolving \r\noutstanding war-crimes cases. We remain willing to \r\nsupport such efforts. We applaud the ICTY for adhering \r\nto its completion schedule. It is on track to deliver \r\njudgments in its two remaining substantive cases by the \r\nend of November.\r\nWith respect to the upcoming appeal of the \r\njudgment in the case of Prosecutor v. Jadranko Prlić \r\net al., which involved six former high-ranking officials \r\nfrom Herceg-Bosna, we support the independence of \r\nthe Tribunal in reaching its decision. With respect to \r\nthe cases against Ratko Mladić, who is charged with \r\n11 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and \r\nviolations of the laws and customs of war, we see it \r\nas a fitting bookend to the work of the Tribunal and \r\nyet another example for the world to see that eventually \r\nthose alleged to be responsible for atrocities will \r\nultimately face justice. Both of these cases, like all \r\nothers, involve questions of individual criminality, and \r\nshould not be seen as trials of any one country.\r\nThe United States also commends the work, under \r\nthe leadership of the President of the ICTY, to hold \r\nlegacy and closing events that can help ensure a long-\r\nlasting impact, particularly in ongoing efforts aimed at \r\nachieving justice and reconciliation.\r\nThe United States remains concerned about the \r\ndivisive nature of statements made by some individuals \r\nin the region that have a negative impact on cooperation \r\nin the pursuit of justice for war crimes committed in \r\nthe former Yugoslavia. That is particularly true when \r\nindividuals deny or seek to revise the true record of \r\ncrimes established by the ICTY. We should strive to \r\ndepoliticize the historical record, which can help \r\nprevent a repetition of such widespread atrocities and \r\ncreate the space for technical experts to meet, share \r\ninformation and work together in various forums to \r\nresolve remaining cases.\r\nThe United States also remains concerned about \r\nthe Government of Serbia’s failure to execute the arrest \r\nwarrants for the two surviving individuals charged with \r\ncontempt of court in relation to witness intimidation in \r\nthe case of Prosecutor v. Vojislav Šešelj. We continue to \r\nencourage Serbia to fulfil its obligations.\r\nThe International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals has also made notable progress since we last \r\nconvened here on this item (see A/71/PV.44). From an \r\nadministrative perspective, staff has moved into new \r\npremises in Arusha, Tanzania. Substantively, there has \r\nbeen continued focus on the expeditious completion of \r\ntrials and appeals.\r\nThe United States applauds the Mechanism’s \r\nefforts to assist national jurisdictions by, inter alia, \r\nprocessing requests to question detained persons and \r\nprotected witnesses. We understand that during the \r\nreporting period the Office of the Prosecutor also \r\nanswered 11 requests from Member States and one \r\ninternational organization with regard to Rwanda, and \r\n239 requests for assistance from eight Member States \r\nand three international organizations with regard to the \r\nformer Yugoslavia. In addition, it conducted capacity-\r\nbuilding activities with national authorities from \r\nAfrica, Europe and Latin America. We are impressed \r\nwith the range of assistance being provided while the \r\nMechanism remains, under the Security Council’s \r\ndirection, a small and efficient structure.\r\nThe Office of the Prosecutor is continuing its efforts \r\nto locate and arrest the eight remaining fugitives, three \r\nof whom will be tried by the Mechanism — Félicien \r\nKabuga, Protais Mpiranya and Augustin Bizimana; and \r\nfive of whom will be transferred to Rwanda — Fulgence \r\nKayishema, Charles Sikubwabo, Aloys Ndimbati, \r\nPhénéas Munyarugarama and Charles Ryandikayo. \r\nTo that end, we appreciate the Prosecutor’s review of \r\ntracking efforts and the development of updated and \r\nconcrete strategies for apprehending the remaining \r\nfugitives. This includes the development of two task \r\nforces — one focused on Africa and the other on \r\nEurope — thereby bringing together key national law-\r\nenforcement authorities, as well as INTERPOL. We \r\ncommend the Prosecutor for undertaking the much-\r\nneeded restructuring of the tracking team to ensure that \r\nit has the capacity to conduct the range of investigative \r\nactivities needed to succeed in its mission.\r\nThe United States remains equally committed to \r\nthose efforts. We continue to offer a reward of up to \r\n$5 million per fugitive for information leading to the \r\narrest or transfer of those eight men and stand ready to \r\nengage with the new task forces. We likewise call on \r\n18/10/2017 A/72/PV.32\r\n17-32745 17/17\r\nall States, especially those in the Great Lakes region, \r\nto cooperate with efforts to apprehend these fugitives.\r\nFinally, I want highlight once again two of my \r\nearlier points. First, while the ICTY is successfully \r\nconcluding its mandate, reconciliation and the pursuit \r\nof justice remain priorities. We are now focusing \r\nour attention on national-level obligations to resolve \r\nremaining war-crimes cases. Secondly, the work of \r\nboth the Mechanism and the ICTY reminds us that, in \r\nthe face of horrific atrocities, we can work together to \r\nhold perpetrators accountable and achieve a measure of \r\njustice for their victims.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe Assembly to take note of the twenty-fourth and \r\nfinal annual report of the International Tribunal for \r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious \r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law \r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia \r\nsince 1991?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I also take it that it is the \r\nwish of the Assembly to take note of the fifth annual \r\nreport of the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of \r\nTurkey, who wishes to speak in explanation of position.\r\nMr. Begeç (Turkey): I have asked to take the f loor \r\nin order to register my country’s position with regard \r\nto the fifth annual report of the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals (A/72/261).\r\nCertain contents of the report refer explicitly or \r\nimplicitly to my country and Turkish nationals, including \r\nin its paragraphs 16 and 26. The official position of \r\nTurkey with regard to the matter of diplomatic immunity \r\nhas been shared with the appropriate counterparts of \r\nthe Office of Legal Affairs of the Secretariat, as well \r\nas with the Secretary-General, through a note verbale \r\ndated 11 November 2016 and a letter dated 6 February \r\n2017, respectively. These communications expressed, \r\ninter alia, our disagreement with the competent United \r\nNations authorities on the scope of the immunity \r\nenjoyed by the Turkish Judge of the Mechanism.\r\nWe have also communicated our views with regard \r\nto certain acts of the Mechanism and the abuse of \r\nauthority thereof, through a letter to the President of \r\nthe Security Council dated 10 March. This letter has \r\nsubsequently been distributed to the wider membership \r\nas document S/2017/210.\r\nIn the light of the foregoing and in accordance \r\nwith decision 55/488, I would like to state for the \r\nrecord Turkey’s non-concurrence with and resultant \r\ndisapproval of the aforementioned sections of the \r\nreport and to register the lack of consensus on them in \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nSome Member States have also expressed views \r\non this subject. Notwithstanding the literal content of \r\nthose views, allow me to say that any attempt or intent \r\nto interfere with the independent judiciary of a Member \r\nState is neither permissible nor welcome, in particular \r\nin this Hall.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda items 75 and 129?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.55 p.m.\r\n"
