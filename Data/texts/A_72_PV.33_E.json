To begin, I will make \r\nthree brief points.\r\nFirst, I want to acknowledge the importance of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). \r\nNEPAD was something of a trailblazer. It predates, by \r\nmore than a decade, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the African Union’s Agenda 2063: \r\nThe Africa We Want. Nevertheless, many of its core \r\npriorities are also found in those later frameworks, \r\nincluding infrastructure development, human \r\ndevelopment, food security, education and training, \r\nand health.\r\nSince its adoption in 2001, NEPAD has led \r\ntransformative change. For example, the Comprehensive \r\nAfrica Agriculture Development Programme has \r\nimproved agricultural productivity on the continent. \r\nIt has also changed people’s lives in many African \r\ncountries. Additionally, NEPAD has generated big \r\nstrides towards the integration of African trade. The \r\nfinalization this summer of the Tripartite Free Trade \r\nArea Agreement was an important step that will \r\nharmonize three subregional blocs that previously had \r\ntheir own rules and models for trade. A continental free \r\ntrade area is no longer a distant dream; it could very \r\nsoon be a reality.\r\nMajor hurdles still need to be overcome. Faster \r\nprogress needs to be made, not only in the sectors of \r\nagriculture and trade, but also in a wide range of key \r\nareas including infrastructure, industry, economic \r\ndiversification and poverty eradication. NEPAD, \r\ntogether with the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063, sets \r\nout a very clear plan for how such progress can be \r\nachieved. We must ensure that those frameworks are \r\nharmonized and integrated, particularly with regard to \r\nreporting, follow-up and review.\r\nSecondly, I want to repeat a message that I \r\nhave heard many times this week, which is that no \r\ndevelopment in Africa can take hold unless it is led from \r\nwithin. When NEPAD was adopted in 2001, it acted as \r\na strong sign of regional leadership in development. \r\nThat was reaffirmed through the adoption of Agenda \r\n2063. The roles played by the African Union, regional \r\neconomic communities and subregional organizations \r\nhave been indispensable. They have acted as the \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

There are ongoing efforts to integrate \r\nthe goals and targets of international and regional \r\nframeworks into national development plans. African \r\ncountries are also building their capacities for domestic \r\nresource mobilization and tackling illicit financial \r\nf lows. However, in an increasingly globalized world, \r\nno single country or region can go it alone.\r\nThe efforts taking place within Africa need to be \r\nsupported by a revitalized partnership for development. \r\nWe need closer partnerships between Africa and its \r\ndevelopment partners, including the United Nations \r\nbodies and Member States. Official development \r\nassistance and other commitments are crucial in order \r\nto enhance finance, technology transfer and market \r\naccess. Moreover, investment must be incentivized at \r\nthe national, regional and international levels.\r\nThirdly, as we have heard this week, development \r\nin Africa should not be seen as a stand-alone activity. \r\nNo support that we give to the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development will bring about lasting change \r\nif we do not also address the root causes of conflict. \r\nSimilarly, we cannot look at how to prevent societies \r\nturning to violence without addressing many of the core \r\npriorities of NEPAD. That is why today’s joint debate is \r\nvery important. It deal with issues that are different but \r\nclosely linked. That reflects reality for many people. \r\nYes, sustainable and inclusive development will improve \r\nentire societies, but the signing of a trade agreement \r\nwill mean little to a mother whose young child is very \r\nsick from malaria. Similarly, foreign direct investment \r\nis not on the mind of someone who is running away \r\nfrom a hail of bullets.\r\nAfrica has a very clear vision. It is one that involves \r\nall layers of society, while benefiting from growth and \r\ndevelopment; one in which malaria and other diseases do \r\nnot serve as death sentences for hundreds of thousands \r\nof people every year; one in which early warning signs \r\nof conflict lead more often to successful mediation than \r\nto violence; and one in which institutions are strong, \r\nboth women and young people lead and participate, and \r\ngood governance is the norm. That vision is becoming \r\ncloser to reality. This week and today’s debate will \r\nallow us to take another step in the right direction.\r\nMr. Charwath (Austria): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Friends of Inclusive and Sustainable \r\nIndustrial Development — a group of 37 countries \r\nthat believes that inclusive and sustainable industrial \r\ndevelopment plays a crucial role in achieving the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that we have \r\nset for ourselves in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. We thank the Secretary-General for \r\nthe fifteenth consolidated progress report on the \r\nimplementation of and international support for the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). \r\nThe report outlines that,\r\n“an immediate priority for African countries \r\nis to intensify efforts to accelerate economic \r\ngrowth through industrialization and structural \r\ntransformation, which are key to achieving \r\nsustainable development”. (A/72/223, pp. 1-2)\r\nThe role played by industrialization as one of the \r\nkey enablers and catalysts for sustainable development \r\nhas been well established. Target 2 of SDG 9 aims at \r\npromoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization \r\nand at raising industry’s share in employment and \r\ngross domestic product. In that regard, achieving \r\nstructural transformation through more accelerated \r\nand coordinated industrialization efforts should \r\nremain a key development priority for Africa. We \r\ntherefore welcome efforts by the NEPAD Agency, \r\ntogether with the South Africa Council for Scientific \r\nand Industrial Research, to work towards achieving a \r\nroad map for countries outlining ways to achieve the \r\nshort-, medium- and long-term industrialization targets \r\nfor the continent, as set out in the Action Plan for the \r\nAccelerated Industrial Development of Africa. We also \r\nwelcome the initiatives of the Group of 20 to support \r\nthe industrialization efforts of African States through \r\ninvestment promotion and the building of capacity in \r\nscience, technology and innovation programmes in line \r\nwith the African Union’s 2063 Agenda.\r\nThe international community, including the \r\nUnited Nations system, must play a critical role in \r\nassisting countries on the road to industrialization. The \r\nGeneral Assembly’s adoption of the Third Industrial \r\nDevelopment Decade for Africa for the period \r\n2016-2025 (resolution 70/293) adds to that commitment \r\nand assigns the United Nations Industrial Development \r\nOrganization (UNIDO) a leading role in promoting \r\ninclusive and sustainable industrial development in \r\nclose collaboration with the African Union, the United \r\nNations Economic Commission for Africa, the African \r\n20/10/2017 A/72/PV.33\r\n17-33710 3/24\r\nDevelopment Bank and the Office of the Special \r\nAdviser on Africa.\r\nUNIDO assists developing countries in designing \r\nand implementing industrial policies and enhancing \r\nlocal productive capacities and entrepreneurship. \r\nIts technical assistance contributes to job creation, \r\nadvancing economic competitiveness and enabling \r\nmarket access. UNIDO also plays a significant role \r\nin advancing the diffusion of environmentally sound \r\ntechnologies and practices in production systems and \r\nin collaborating with the private and public sector so as \r\nto mobilize investments in an inclusive, sustainable and \r\nresilient manner.\r\nWe commend UNIDO for the important role \r\nthat it plays in furthering inclusive and sustainable \r\nindustrialization, and we trust that it will play an \r\nimportant role in the industrial development of Africa \r\nin line with continental, regional and national priorities.\r\nMr. Moustafa (Egypt): I have the honour to \r\naddress the General Assembly on behalf of the Group \r\nof African States in this important debate on issues \r\nof great importance to Africa’s peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. I would like in that connection to thank \r\nPresident Lajčák for his opening remarks.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to express the deep \r\nappreciation of the African Group to all Member States \r\nfor their commitment to keeping the special needs of \r\nAfrica among the top priorities of the Organization, \r\nand for showing solidarity with African countries in \r\ntheir efforts to achieve inclusive growth, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and promoting peace and stability across \r\nthe continent. I also wish to take this opportunity to \r\nrecognize the efforts of Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres and the entire United Nations system for their \r\ncommitment to enhancing coherent United Nations \r\nsystem support for Africa, as well as for supporting the \r\ntransformative African Union Agenda 2063.\r\nThe peace and development nexus is evident \r\ntoday in the two reports of the Secretary-General, \r\nwhich constitute the basis of our debate — namely, \r\nthe report entitled “New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment: fifteenth consolidated progress report on \r\nimplementation and international support” (A/72/223) \r\nand that entitled “Causes of conflict and the promotion \r\nof durable peace and sustainable development in \r\nAfrica” (A/72/269). Clearly, as the world pursues a new \r\nmilestone in the global partnership for development, as \r\nrepresented by the ongoing process of implementing the \r\n2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, it is imperative \r\nto continue to place Africa at the centre of United \r\nNations efforts to eradicate poverty, address the impact \r\nof climate change and ensure inclusive economic \r\ngrowth and sustainable development.\r\nIndeed, eradicating poverty remains the greatest \r\ndevelopment challenge for African countries, in which \r\nhalf of the world’s poor live. The African Group is \r\nconcerned about the fact that two years after we began \r\nimplementing the 2030 Agenda, global hunger is once \r\nagain on the rise and affects 815 million people. That \r\nis an increase from 777 million in 2015, according \r\nto recent reports on the state of food security and \r\nnutrition. It is therefore imperative that we ensure that \r\nthe special development needs of Africa, particularly \r\npoverty eradication, are accorded due attention by the \r\nUnited Nations development system.\r\nIn that regard, our efforts should focus on the \r\nnecessary means of implementation, including \r\nfinancial resources, technology transfer and capacity-\r\nbuilding. The scale must be ambitious enough to \r\nmeet the aspirations of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs). Developed countries should fulfil the \r\ncommitments that they made in the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda, including official development assistance \r\ncommitments, as aid remains an important source \r\nof development financing for developing countries, \r\nparticularly in Africa.\r\nThe African Group expects that a renewed \r\ncommitment to the Global Partnership for Sustainable \r\nDevelopmnet will enable a speedy implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda. While we stress the importance \r\nof international support, I would nonetheless like to \r\nemphasize that African ownership of the development \r\nprocess is not just a mere concept. African countries \r\nhave indeed taken primary responsibility for their \r\nown development. The experience of implementing \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals has shown that \r\nsignifican advances were made by African countries, \r\nparticularly in improving primary-school enrolment, \r\nadvancing gender equality and halting the spread of \r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nThose advances were mainly the result of sound \r\nmacroeconomic policies and the remarkable economic \r\ngrowth that Africa has achieved over the past two \r\ndecades. Nevertheless, systemic issues have affected \r\nAfrica’s rates of economic growth, and international \r\nsupport was not sufficient to bring about a significant \r\nA/72/PV.33 20/10/2017\r\n4/24 17-33710\r\nreduction in unemployment and poverty levels, nor in \r\neffecting similar positive advances in other goals.\r\nAs we appreciate the steady progress in \r\nimplementing the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), and the strong support of the \r\nUnited Nations, particularly in enhancing the Office of \r\nthe Special Adviser on Africa, we have to be mindful \r\nthat mobilizing support for Africa is now more urgent \r\nthan ever. That is particularly the case as Africa \r\nimplements Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, which \r\nrepresents the continent’s ambitious and transformative \r\n50-year vision. That people-centred agenda is \r\nunderpinned by seven core aspirations, including \r\ninclusive growth and sustainable development, regional \r\nintegration, peace and good governance. Achieving \r\nthose aspirations ultimately hinges on development \r\ncooperation and our overall commitment to promoting \r\na strengthened partnership.\r\nThe challenges facing Africa today encompass \r\nthe issues of peace, security and development. \r\nThere can be no lasting security without inclusive \r\ndevelopment. Similarly, peace, security and the rule of \r\nlaw — underpinned by credible systems of democratic \r\ngovernance — are prerequisite and indispensable \r\nfactors for and drivers of development. It is imperative, \r\nin that regard, to encourage all partners, including the \r\nUnited Nations system, to support the efforts of African \r\ncountries in achieving the African Union’s Silencing \r\nthe Guns by 2020 initiative, as envisioned by African \r\nleaders in the African Union’s Fiftieth Anniversary \r\nSolemn Declaration.\r\nAfrican countries have taken numerous steps to \r\naddress peace and security challenges at the national and \r\nregional levels, including — in dealing with terrorism \r\nand instability — the establishment of the Joint Force \r\nof the Group of Five for the Sahel, the Multinational \r\nJoint Task Force and the deployment of the African \r\nUnion Mission in Somalia. Despite limited capacity \r\nand resources, those commendable efforts serve as \r\nproof of Africa’s determination to find solutions to \r\nits own security challenges. Furthermore, African \r\ncountries have demonstrated a growing commitment to \r\nthe rule of law and good governance. The African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism (APRM) has become a unique and \r\ninnovative framework for promoting good governance, \r\ndurable peace and sustainable development across \r\nthe continent. The African Union is working hard to \r\nencourage all African Member States to join the APRM.\r\nIn order to complement and strengthen African \r\nefforts to address challenges to the continent’s peace and \r\nsecurity, it is critical that Africa’s partners strengthen \r\ntheir support for African peace and security activities \r\nand help build the continent’s capacity to prevent and \r\nresolve conflict through increased assistance. No \r\ncountry or organization can solve those challenges \r\nalone. Moreover, the African Group underscores \r\nthe importance of the long-standing and exemplary \r\npartnership between the United Nations and Africa, \r\nnotably in efforts to support the establishment and \r\noperationalization of the African Peace and Security \r\nArchitecture. That includes cooperation between \r\nthe Peace and Security Council of the African Union \r\nand the United Nations Security Council, as well as \r\nthe African Standby Force and continued support for \r\nthe APRM.\r\nThe African Group commends the renewed \r\ncommitment on the part of the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union to strengthening their cooperation and \r\npromoting a strategic partnership, as demonstrated by \r\nthe signing in April of the Joint United Nations-African \r\nUnion Framework for an Enhanced Partnership in \r\nPeace and Security. In that regard, the African Group \r\nwishes to acknowledge Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres’ emphasis on prevention as an important \r\ncornerstone that reinforces the nexus between the key \r\npillars of the work of the United Nations, namely, peace \r\nand security, development and human rights. Indeed, \r\npromoting sustainable development and ensuring a life \r\nof dignity for all represent the most effective strategy \r\nfor conflict prevention.\r\nWith regard to the acceleration of efforts to \r\ncontrol and eliminate malaria by 2030 in developing \r\ncountries — particularly African countries — the \r\nAfrican Group welcomes the continued commitment \r\non the part of the international community to the \r\neradication of malaria and other diseases, as stipulated \r\nclearly under Sustainable Development Goal 3 of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda. In that regard, we underscore the \r\nneed to undertake preventive measures, including \r\nstrengthening the capacities of African countries’ \r\nhealth and disease surveillance systems. We concur \r\nwith the recommendations of the Secretary-General \r\nthat a concerted and coordinated global effort will \r\nbe needed in order to substantially reduce malaria \r\ntransmission, morbidity and mortality by 2030.\r\nFinally, I wish to conclude by emphasizing that the \r\nAfrican Group stands ready to work with the United \r\n20/10/2017 A/72/PV.33\r\n17-33710 5/24\r\nNations system and other development partners to \r\nmobilize support for the integrated implementation \r\nof Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want and the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, in order to ensure \r\na mutually reinforcing implementation of both agendas.\r\nMr. Ismail (Brunei Darussalam): I have the honour \r\nof speaking on agenda item 66 on behalf of the 10 States \r\nmembers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN), namely, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, \r\nthe Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam and my \r\nown country, Brunei Darussalam.\r\nWe too would like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his latest report (A/72/223) on the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), which provides \r\nvaluable and practical insights on the way forward. \r\nWe acknowledge the progress made in achieving the \r\npriorities set by NEPAD. That is particularly noteworthy \r\nagainst the backdrop of the current unfavourable global \r\neconomic conditions, as well as persistent challenges in \r\nthe areas of agricultural productivity and food security, \r\neconomic diversification and market access, and the \r\nlack of financing and capacity, among other things.\r\nAs sustainable development and sustaining peace \r\nare mutually reinforcing, it is important to safeguard \r\nadvances in socioeconomic development through the \r\npromotion of sustainable peace. In that regard, it is \r\nencouraging to see many African countries continue \r\nto intensify their efforts and seize opportunities to \r\naccelerate progress towards durable peace, security and \r\ndevelopment in the region.\r\nASEAN reaffirms its solidarity with Africa, \r\nespecially with respect to realizing our shared \r\naspirations for growth, prosperity and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. As such, ASEAN fully supports the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD, which will provide a strong \r\nfoundation for Africa’s Agenda 2063. We welcome the \r\nefforts by the African Union and the United Nations \r\nsystem under the Regional Coordination Mechanism \r\nfor Africa to align the Agenda 2063 and the Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. We are pleased to note \r\nthat their meeting in Senegal last March focused on \r\ninvesting in youth, who represent a key driving force \r\nfor inclusive and sustainable development in Africa, \r\nwhere the world’s youngest population is concentrated.\r\nIn ASEAN, we are also exploring ways and \r\nmeans of promoting synergies and complementarities \r\nbetween the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and \r\nthe 2030 Agenda. Recently, on the margins of the \r\nhigh-level general debate, ASEAN, together with the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, launched \r\nthe ASEAN My World survey. That project aims \r\nto capture the people’s perspective on progress in \r\nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals and to \r\nmobilize and build dialogue between decision-makers \r\nand people, with a view to shaping recommendations \r\nand policies on how to implement the 2030 Agenda. We \r\ntherefore believe that there is ample scope for greater \r\ncollaboration between ASEAN and Africa to address \r\nmutual concerns and achieve sustainable development.\r\nASEAN and African countries have an enduring \r\nfriendship that is guided by the spirit of solidarity for \r\npeace and prosperity. That friendship dates back to the \r\n1955 Bandung Conference. Two years ago, we met again \r\nin Indonesia to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary \r\nof that historic occasion and revitalize our political, \r\neconomic and sociocultural cooperation.\r\nEnhancing people-to-people linkages is a key aspect \r\nof that partnership, which brings professionals, business \r\npeople, students and travellers from both regions closer \r\ntogether. ASEAN, both as a whole and as individual \r\nmember States, stands ready to exchange ideas and \r\nshare experiences with our African partners in various \r\nfields, such as agriculture, education, information and \r\ncommunications-technology innovation, trade and \r\ninfrastructure development.\r\nA supportive international environment is vital \r\nfor catalysing further development in Africa. In that \r\nregard, development partners, international financial \r\ninstitutions, regional and subregional organizations \r\nand the international community, especially the \r\nUnited Nations, must redouble their efforts to ensure \r\nthat African countries achieve sustainable peace \r\nand development.\r\nIn conclusion, ASEAN is committed to supporting \r\nthe endeavours of our African friends and the \r\ninternational community to bring about meaningful \r\nprogress in the implementation of Agenda 2063 for the \r\nbenefit of Africa.\r\nMr. Prasad (India): We are meeting at a time when \r\nall of us have embarked on the journey towards achieving \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which \r\nwas adopted two years ago. Our African partners have \r\nalso commenced the first phase of the implementation \r\nof the more long-term African Agenda 2063. Agenda \r\n2063 is mutually reinforced by the 2030 Agenda and \r\nA/72/PV.33 20/10/2017\r\n6/24 17-33710\r\nbuilds on the core priorities of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), which came into \r\nexistence 16 years ago.\r\nInternational cooperation remains a critical \r\nelement in Africa’s efforts to achieve the greater \r\npeace and prosperity envisaged in the two Agendas. \r\nNEPAD is an important part of those collaborative \r\nefforts. Africa has made rapid strides in recent years. \r\nCompared with even a decade ago, the continent is \r\nmore peaceful. Its governance institutions are stronger. \r\nIts overall economic output has grown. Poverty rates \r\nhave fallen. Infrastructure and connectivity are \r\nimproving, and the economies are more diversified. \r\nIn several countries, the service sectors, including \r\nbanking, telecommunications and retail, have been \r\ngrowing, in spite of the fact that low commodity prices \r\nhave adversely impacted many economies.\r\nLife expectancy has increased. Rates of infant \r\nand maternal mortality have fallen. Primary-school \r\nenrolment, especially for girls, has increased. \r\nMalnutrition has been reduced, and access to safe \r\ndrinking water has increased. HIV infection and \r\nprevalence rates have been reversed, as noted by the \r\nSecretary-General in his remarks earlier this week at \r\nthe opening of Africa Week 2017.\r\nToday, Africa is a young continent with a \r\ndemographic dividend that can be of great advantage \r\nif young people are provided with education and the \r\nskills needed for economic opportunities. International \r\ncooperation can help overcome constraints posed by \r\npoor connectivity and infrastructure, low agriculture \r\nproductivity, the lack of diversification in certain \r\neconomies and limited regional integration.\r\nWe commend the organization of the ongoing Africa \r\nWeek. It helps focus attention on the opportunities and \r\nchallenges faced by Africa. It would also help to engage \r\nUnited Nations entities in effective partnerships for the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.\r\nLong-standing trade and diaspora links across \r\nthe Indian Ocean, a shared colonial past and our \r\ncommon development challenges have framed \r\nIndia’s relationship with Africa. Today, Africa and \r\nIndia represent young and dynamic societies and \r\neconomies that are intensifying their collaboration so \r\nas to achieve greater prosperity for their peoples in \r\nan increasingly globalized world. The core strengths \r\nof our development partnership have been capacity-\r\nbuilding, mobilizing financial support and the sharing \r\nof technical expertise. That complements our rapidly \r\ngrowing trade and investment links.\r\nTrade between Africa and India has increased \r\nby a factor of 20 in the past 15 years and doubled \r\nin the past five years, reaching nearly $72 billion in \r\n2016 and making India Africa’s fourth-largest trading \r\npartner. Indian investment in Africa has also surged, \r\nwith major investments in the telecommunications, \r\ninformation technology, energy, engineering, chemicals, \r\npharmaceuticals and automobile sectors.\r\nIndian leaders continue to attach a very high priority \r\nto our partnership with Africa. Earlier in October, Africa \r\nwas the destination for the first overseas visit by the \r\nnew President of India, His Excellency Mr. Ram Nath \r\nKovind. During the past three years, the top leadership \r\nof India, including the President, Vice-President and \r\nPrime Minister, have visited 18 African countries. \r\nIndian ministers have visited all 54 partner countries \r\nduring that period. In a significant development, the \r\nAfrican Development Bank held its board meeting in \r\nIndia this year. During the meeting, Prime Minister \r\nModi announced the launch of India’s latest initiative in \r\nAfrica, the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor, established \r\nin partnership with Japan.\r\nWe have also had 11 incoming visits by African \r\nHeads of State and Government, in addition to the \r\nlandmark Third India-Africa Forum Summit, held two \r\nyears ago in Delhi, where 41 African Heads of State \r\nand Government participated. During the Summit, \r\nthe Government of India announced significant offers \r\nof development partnership, including $10 billion in \r\nconcessional credits, as well as grant assistance of \r\n$600 million and 50,000 scholarships over the next \r\nfive years.\r\nIndia has also engaged with the Group of 20 and \r\nthe Brazil, Russia, India and China group on issues \r\nregarding the development priorities of Africa. Besides \r\nthe wide-ranging development and humanitarian \r\nassistance efforts, India also partners with Africa in \r\npromoting peace and security through its long-standing \r\ncontribution to peacekeeping and peacebuilding \r\nefforts. Recent initiatives have also included trilateral \r\ncooperation, along with the United States of America, \r\nto provide United Nations peacekeeping training for \r\nAfrican partners.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating what Prime \r\nMinister Modi said during the Africa Development \r\nBank Board meeting in India this year, which is that \r\n20/10/2017 A/72/PV.33\r\n17-33710 7/24\r\nIndia’s partnership with Africa is based on a model of \r\ncooperation. It is responsive to the needs of African \r\ncountries, demand-driven and free of conditions.\r\nThe long-standing India-Africa partnership is \r\nbased on solidarity and mutual respect and is neither \r\nprescriptive nor exploitative. It represents South-South \r\ncooperation in all its dimensions, one that continues \r\nto contribute to the implementation of 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and the African Union’s \r\nAgenda 2063: The Africa We Want.\r\nMr. Almunayer (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation has the honour to participate in this debate \r\non the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD). We have considered with great interest the \r\ncontent of the Secretary-General’s report (A/72/223) \r\nof 28 July, entitled “New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment: fifteenth consolidated progress report \r\non implementation and international support”. The \r\nreport focuses on political measures taken by African \r\ncountries and organizations to implement NEPAD, as \r\nwell as the commitments announced to assist African \r\nStates, the progress they have made and the challenges \r\nthey face. It also focuses on progress made to implement \r\nthe NEPAD Agenda, including the need to sustain and \r\nforge partnerships aimed at addressing issues of States’ \r\nnational security.\r\nTwo years ago, Africa saw the launch of two historic \r\nagendas, one global and the other continental. The first \r\nis the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nthe second is the 2063 Agenda of the African Union. \r\nBoth provide long-term development visions. We hope \r\nthat the objectives of those visions will be implemented \r\nto advance Africa. The first 10-year implementation \r\nplan was adopted in June 2015 to implement the 2063 \r\nAgenda of the African Union, and there will be other \r\nstrategies in the next 50 years.\r\nThe harmony and interdependence of those two \r\nAgendas provide a common path for implementing the \r\nobjectives that Africa aspires to reach. That is reflected \r\nin the Secretary-General’s report, as are the challenges \r\nfacing Africa, notably insufficient financial support, \r\nthe spread of weapons and transnational organized \r\ncrime, as well as trafficking in natural resources.\r\nWe are very concerned about the unfavourable \r\neconomic circumstances that stand in the way of \r\nimplementing the 2030 Agenda and the NEPAD Agenda. \r\nThey tend to undermine the progress made in the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\ndespite the gains made so far. I would like to emphasize \r\nthe need to implement the recommendations contained \r\nin the Secretary-General’s report, in particular those on \r\ngood governance, the rule of law and the empowerment \r\nand protection of the rights of African women in order \r\nto enhance peacebuilding efforts and implement the \r\nobjective of an Africa free from conflicts.\r\nKuwait prides itself on its historical relations with \r\nAfrica, and we are an observer member of the African \r\nUnion. In 2013, we hosted the third Africa Arab \r\nSummit, under the theme “Partners in Development and \r\nInvestment”. At the Summit, Amir Sabah Al-Ahmad \r\nal-Sabah announced the provision of concessionary \r\nloans to non-Arab African countries through the \r\nKuwait Development Fund. During the Summit, Kuwait \r\nalso announced the investment of $1 billion through \r\nthe General Investment Authority in collaboration \r\nwith the World Bank and its institutions, as well as \r\nthe China-Africa Development Fund, to invest in the \r\ninfrastructure of Africa.\r\nThe loans provided by the Kuwait Development \r\nFund have reached $20 billion so far. Loans have been \r\ngranted to 106 countries worldwide; African countries \r\nalone have received 18 per cent of that amount. It is \r\nalso important to mention the initiative of the Amir \r\nof Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad al-Sabah, which \r\nprovides an annual award of $1 million in the name of \r\nMr. Abdul Rahman Al-Sumait, the late Kuwaiti doctor \r\nwho was active in humanitarian affairs and activities \r\nin Africa. The annual award is given for development \r\nresearch in Africa and under the supervision of the \r\nKuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences. \r\nKuwait will also host a conference for supporting \r\neducation in Somalia in the near future, as we believe \r\nin the need to promote education towards a future that \r\nmeets the aspirations of the Somali people and in a \r\nmanner that keeps abreast of modern developments.\r\n I would like to emphasize that, given our \r\nhistorical bonds and common destiny, the international \r\ncommunity, international organizations and \r\nnon-governmental organizations in the private sector \r\nmust act vigorously to support the needs of Africa and \r\nassist them in implementing their aspirations to achieve \r\ndevelopment and economic prosperity.\r\nMrs. Rugwabiza (Rwanda): At the outset, Rwanda \r\nthanks you, Mr. President, for convening this important \r\njoint debate. We also thank the Secretary-General for \r\nA/72/PV.33 20/10/2017\r\n8/24 17-33710\r\nthe reports submitted under agenda item 13 (А/72/223 \r\nand A/72/269) to inform today’s meeting.\r\nWith the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the African Union’s \r\nAgenda 2063: The Africa We Want, the world and \r\nthe African continent set forth ambitious strategic \r\nframeworks for a socioeconomic transformation. \r\nThe Addis Ababa Action Agenda establishes a strong \r\nfoundation to support the implementation of both \r\nAgendas by aligning all financing f lows and policies \r\nwith economic and social priorities.\r\nThe Kigali Amendment to the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change reinforces the Agendas by setting \r\nenvironmental targets and time frames. My delegation \r\nrecognizes the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating \r\nAgency’s efforts aimed at strengthening capacities \r\nat the continental, national and regional levels, as we \r\nassert that efficient, robust and coordinated efforts are \r\nimperative for the successful implementation of the \r\ntwo Agendas.\r\nThroughout the continent, notable socioeconomic \r\nprogress has been achieved since 2015. In that regard, \r\nwe congratulate the African Union and the NEPAD \r\nAgency on the finalization of the Tripartite Free Trade \r\nArea Agreement in July. That marked the beginning of \r\nthe operationalization of the Agreement, namely, the \r\nimplementation of f lagship projects of the programme \r\nfor infrastructure development in Africa.\r\nThe agricultural sector is an important one for \r\nAfrica’s sustainable development. Achieving impactful \r\nagricultural transformation will necessitate strong \r\ncoordination between partners in country-led processes. \r\nRenewed partnerships built on mutual accountability \r\nwill help Governments, the private sector, civil \r\nsociety, farmers and farmers’ cooperatives, as well as \r\ndevelopment partners, to deliver on the results needed \r\nto reach the targets set by the Malabo Declaration on \r\nAccelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation \r\nfor Shared Prosperity and Improved Livelihoods. \r\nIn that regard, we note the efforts of the African \r\nUnion to strengthen mutual accountability through \r\nthe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme partnership platform.\r\nDespite notable advancements, the African \r\ncontinent continuously faces systemic challenges. \r\nInvesting in people-centred development on the \r\ncontinent will require cross-sectoral inclusive policies \r\nto provide youth and women equal opportunities to \r\ntake part in the prosperity of The Africa We Want \r\nAgenda. We note the continental education strategy \r\nfor Africa and the gender-equality strategy, which \r\nare the blueprints for mainstreaming and scaling up \r\neducation and the promotion of gender and women’s \r\nempowerment. Furthermore, the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism demonstrates the valuable African efforts \r\nthat have been made to prevent conflict by addressing \r\nthe root causes and drivers of conflict. Through \r\ninitiatives such as Silence the Guns by 2020, the African \r\ncontinent has underscored the nexus between security \r\nand development and the importance of conflict \r\nprevention and response to early-warning signals with \r\nrapid intervention to protect civilians.\r\nThe Joint United Nations-African Union \r\nFramework for an Enhanced Partnership in Peace \r\nand Security is an important blueprint for boosting \r\nthe coordination between the two organizations at all \r\nlevels. The implementation of the United Nations and \r\nthe African Union’s development agendas through the \r\npillars provided by the NEPAD Agency will be realized \r\nonly if the global commitment of leaving no one behind \r\nis upheld through mutually reinforcing partnerships. \r\nA revitalized global partnership for development is \r\ntherefore an indispensable ingredient for success. In that \r\nregard, we congratulate both the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union for the reforms that each is undertaking \r\nto recalibrate and become fit for purpose so as to be \r\nable to competently support the collective efforts of \r\nAfrican Member States to achieve the complementary \r\nagendas of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.\r\nLastly, on the progress on implementing the \r\nprogramme of the 2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa, \r\nRwanda is committed to working alongside other \r\nAfrican Member States to eradicate malaria by shifting \r\nthe paradigm from malaria control and prevention \r\nactivities to a scaled-up targeted identification and \r\nresponse, where enhanced malaria surveillance and \r\nresponses will prevent infection and shrink the malaria \r\nmap across the continent.\r\nMr. Annakou (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): I thank \r\nyou, Mr. President, for having organized this important \r\nmeeting. At the outset, I would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the two reports on development \r\nin Africa (A/72/223 and A/72/269). I would also like to \r\nthank Mr. Mayaki, Chief Executive Officer of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), for his \r\nefforts to support the African continent.\r\n20/10/2017 A/72/PV.33\r\n17-33710 9/24\r\nMy country’s delegation aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States.\r\nThis plenary meeting on NEPAD is being held two \r\nyears after the adoption by world leaders of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, which is based \r\non the idea of leaving no one behind. This meeting is \r\nalso taking place following the adoption by African \r\nleaders of Agenda 2063, which provides a 50-year \r\nplan for peace, security and development in Africa, \r\nand following the adoption of the African Union’s \r\nfirst 10-year plan. Agenda 2063 is centred around \r\npeople, who are both the instruments and the goals \r\nof development. In order to move from planning to \r\ncomprehensive and integrated implementation, NEPAD \r\nand African regional economic commissions must play \r\na central role in aligning the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) and the African Union’s 10-year action \r\nplan in order to implement those goals and targets at the \r\nnational and regional levels, while taking into account \r\nthe national, cultural and religious specificities of the \r\npeople of the continent. In that regard, we stress the \r\nimportance of coordinated integration in Africa. That \r\nrequires integration first at the national level and then \r\nat the regional level, and the regions must also work \r\ntogether to ensure integration throughout the continent.\r\nDespite all the efforts deployed throughout the \r\ncontinent and the progress made in certain areas with \r\nthe support of development partners, the African \r\ncontinent faces many challenges in implementing the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including \r\npoverty, violence, conflicts, climate change, capital \r\noutf lows, migration and many others. The continent \r\nalso suffers from high unemployment levels; poor \r\neducation levels, both quantitatively and qualitatively; \r\nand a lack of basic services, such as electricity, water \r\nand sanitation.\r\nAs we face those challenges, developed countries \r\nmust honour the commitments they made at the main \r\nUnited Nations conferences on Africa. They must also \r\nsupport African countries in strengthening economic \r\nstability and help them to attract investment. That \r\nwill contribute to capacity-building in Africa without \r\nexhausting the continent’s natural resources. That will \r\nlead to true human-resource development in Africa and \r\nmust also involve the private sector, so as to facilitate \r\ntechnology transfers, especially in food security and \r\ninfrastructure, and empower youth and women so that \r\nthey can gain the necessary competencies to fully carry \r\nout the SDGs.\r\nWith regard to peace and security in Africa, \r\nmany countries on our continent, including my \r\ncountry, Libya, continue, regrettably, to suffer from a \r\ndeteriorating security situation and armed conflicts. In \r\nthat regard, we stress the intrinsic link between security \r\nand development. There can be no development without \r\nsecurity and no security without development. That is \r\nwhy we must urgently support the countries facing \r\nchallenges or recently emerging from conflict, so as \r\nto improve stability and security and prevent conflicts, \r\nmaintain peace and improve conditions after conflicts \r\nhave ended. Indeed, the African continent cannot move \r\nforward economically or developmentally without \r\nenjoying peace, security and stability and without a \r\nstrengthened rule of law, good governance and respect \r\nfor human rights.\r\nMy country, Libya, like many other countries, \r\nis a transit country for migrants and is suffering \r\nfrom instability owing to significant f lows of illegal \r\nmigration, as well as transnational crime, human \r\ntrafficking and other issues, which are all the result \r\nof challenges relating to border control. In that \r\nconnection, I affirm that migration is an international \r\nmultidimensional problem and not merely a national or \r\nregional one. We must not place the responsibility for \r\nsolving it on countries of transit. We must address the \r\nroot causes of the problem, not its symptoms, in order to \r\nbring about development in countries of origin, with the \r\nsupport of destination countries, through technology \r\ntransfers and by strengthening capacity-building, \r\ncreating decent working conditions, supporting small \r\nand medium-sized enterprises and working to combat \r\nthe organizations and groups involved in trafficking in \r\nmigrants in countries of origin and destination.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nthe Addis Ababa Action Agenda focus on the need to \r\nmobilize financial resources to achieve the SDGs. In \r\nthat connection, we must note that many developing \r\ncountries, especially in Africa, including Libya, are \r\nlosing part of their wealth owing to illicit financial \r\noutf lows, both on the continent and beyond. The \r\ncountries to which those funds have been sent must \r\ntherefore work to detect where those funds are situated \r\nand return them to their countries of origin, so that the \r\nlatter will be able to benefit from them and finance \r\ntheir development plans and their infrastructure. \r\nA/72/PV.33 20/10/2017\r\n10/24 17-33710\r\nIn order to combat the problem, we must take the \r\nfollowing measures.\r\nFirst, States Members of the United Nations, \r\nespecially African countries, should not serve as \r\nfinancial havens for those funds. We must put an end \r\nto the illicit financial f lows and stop encouraging \r\ncorruption. The question is, if developed countries \r\ndid not provide corrupt organizations with secure \r\nfinancial havens, would that corruption be able to \r\npersist and develop exponentially to its current level, \r\nwhich is valued in trillions of dollars, according to \r\nestimates of the United Nations and the international \r\nfinancial organizations?\r\nSecondly, those same countries that have received \r\nsuch illicit funds must work to resolve the problem by \r\nidentifying where those monies are and encouraging \r\nbilateral cooperation with the countries of origin of \r\nthose funds so that they can be recovered. Only 3 per \r\ncent of the funds that have been covertly smuggled \r\nout have been returned to the countries of origin, and \r\nthat despite the protocols and conventions aimed at \r\ncombating corruption.\r\nThirdly, we must establish a global mechanism to \r\ncombat financial smuggling and to facilitate the return of \r\nsuch funds to the countries of origin. The United Nations \r\nsystem, including its entities and institutions, must \r\ncollaborate with the World Bank and the International \r\nMonetary Fund to accelerate the implementation of such \r\na mechanism, which must be adopted and respected by \r\ncountries in developing and developed countries, as \r\nwell as by financial organizations.\r\nIn conclusion, let us translate our words into \r\nactions. We must have the genuine political will to take \r\nthe practical measures needed to combat the ongoing \r\nhaemorrhaging of the funds of developing countries \r\nin Africa and throughout the world. I hope we are not \r\nobliged to meet again next year to discuss this agenda \r\nitem and repeat the same words and declarations \r\nwithout having made any tangible progress on that very \r\nimportant and urgent issue.\r\nMr. Plasai (Thailand): The Kingdom of Thailand \r\naligns itself with the statements delivered by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Brunei Darussalam on \r\nbehalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN).\r\nAfrica has come a long way. With abundant natural \r\nresources and vast potential, the continent is now one \r\nof the fastest-growing regions of the world. Over the \r\ndecades, Africa has also worked successfully to deal \r\nwith various challenges of a political, economic or \r\nsocial nature. Thailand commends the role of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) in \r\nfostering integration and development in Africa by \r\nenhancing trade f lows, the movement of people, the \r\ndevelopment of human resources, youth and women’s \r\nempowerment, as well as environmental and food \r\nsecurity. Thailand also congratulates the African \r\nUnion on its fifty-fourth anniversary this year. We \r\nsupport NEPAD’s first 10-year plan on the way towards \r\nachieving Agenda 2063 of the African Union, as it \r\nprovides a joint comprehensive vision for an integrated \r\nand prosperous Africa.\r\nIn recent years, our world has faced increasing acts \r\nof violence, particularly against women and children, \r\nterrorism, conflicts and political instability. That has \r\nundermined progress towards development in many \r\ncountries and regions, including Africa. Now more \r\nthan ever, we need to come together to address the \r\nroot causes of those problems, namely, poverty and \r\nsocial inequality. More importantly, it is imperative \r\nfor the international community to join hands in \r\nhelping countries in post-conflict situations ensure a \r\nsmooth transition and sustain peace through effective \r\npeacebuilding and reconstruction.\r\nAsia and Africa have faced similar development \r\nchallenges, be it in achieving sustainable agriculture, \r\nensuring equal and universal access to health care or \r\nstrengthening infrastructure development. As Thailand \r\nhas now become a donor country, we are committed \r\nto extending our regular support and assistance to \r\nAfrica through various forms of cooperation, including \r\nscholarships, training and local-to-local knowledge \r\ntransfers. Thailand also ranks first among ASEAN \r\ncountries as a trading partner with Africa and third in \r\nterm of investment in the continent.\r\nWe have redefined our cooperation with Africa \r\non the basis of trust and mutual interests under \r\nthe Thailand-Africa Partnership for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment scheme. The main purpose is to share \r\nwith our African friends the philosophy of His Majesty \r\nthe late King Bhumibol Adulyadej — the Sufficiency \r\nEconomy Philosophy — our home-grown approach to \r\nsustainable development. We believe that philosophy \r\ncan be adapted to meet the needs of Africa in the areas \r\nof agriculture, public health and human-resources \r\ndevelopment, among others, especially in rural areas. \r\n20/10/2017 A/72/PV.33\r\n17-33710 11/24\r\nToday, 21 countries have developed cooperation with \r\nThailand through projects under the Sufficiency \r\nEconomy Philosophy for Sustainable Development \r\nGoals Partnership. In Africa, Sufficiency Economy \r\nPhilosophy projects have been successfully launched \r\nand implemented in Lesotho and Swaziland, and new \r\nprojects will start this year in Mozambique and Senegal.\r\nAt the interregional and multilateral levels, \r\nwe give priority to and participate in international \r\nforums to promote Africa’s development, such as \r\nthe Asia-Africa Conference, the Tokyo International \r\nConference on African Development and the \r\nNew Asian-African Strategic Partnership. Those \r\nconsultation and cooperation processes will help pave \r\nthe way for all of us to achieve our common goals of \r\nsustainable development.\r\nOn our path towards sustainable development, one \r\nof the most challenging tasks at hand is to eradicate \r\npandemics, which continue to leave people in developing \r\nand least-developed nations in dire need of access to \r\nappropriate health care. A part of Thailand’s dedicated \r\nwork in health care has been on combating epidemics \r\nin developing nations, particularly malaria, in order to \r\ncontribute to creating a healthy population in the Asian \r\nregion and beyond. Thailand’s efforts in the past decade \r\nto control the outbreak of malaria have yielded some \r\npositive results. We will continue our work and have put \r\nin place a 10-year National Strategic Plan for Malaria \r\nElimination (2017-2026), with the target of complete \r\nelimination by 2024.\r\nThailand has been sharing and will continue to share \r\nits experience and know-how with its African friends \r\nin health care through human-resources development, \r\nparticularly in the fields related to preventing and \r\ncuring epidemics, as well as the management of health \r\ncare in rural areas.\r\nIn conclusion, Thailand stands ready to cooperate \r\nand work closely with our African friends so that \r\ntogether we can achieve sustainable development, \r\nleaving no one behind. Once again we reaffirm our \r\nsolidarity with Africa. We hope that our continued \r\nsupport will continue to contribute to development in \r\nAfrica in a meaningful way. We also hope that it will \r\ntruly help improve the livelihood and welfare of the \r\nAfrican peoples.\r\nMs. Furman (Israel): African States continue to \r\ndemonstrate drive and resilience, with the African gross \r\ndomestic product growing significantly faster than the \r\nglobal average over the past decade. Africa’s rapid \r\nmodernization has laid the groundwork for expanding \r\nglobal partnerships that will spur the momentum of \r\ndevelopment and help bring regional stability.\r\nThe relationship between Israel and Africa has \r\nnever been stronger. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \r\nNetanyahu visited Africa several times over the \r\npast two years and has hosted numerous African \r\nleaders in Jerusalem. In June 2017, the Israeli Prime \r\nMinister joined the leaders of 15 West African States \r\nin Liberia for the fifty-first Summit of the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States, and in July 2016 \r\nPrime Minister Netanyahu visited Uganda, Kenya, \r\nRwanda and Ethiopia accompanied by business leaders \r\nfrom more than 60 companies in order to strengthen \r\neconomic ties. During those visits, agriculture, health, \r\ninnovation, energy and counter-terrorism were key \r\nitems on the agenda.\r\nThe theme of the current, seventy-second session of \r\nthe General Assembly is “Focusing on people: Striving \r\nfor peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet”. \r\nIt is in that spirit that we need to focus on the things that \r\nwe have in common, which are what unite us. African \r\nnations face many of the same challenges as Israel and \r\nmust use human capital to create sustainable solutions.\r\nSustainable development in Israel relies on what \r\nthe Secretary-General calls Israel’s “knowledge-based \r\neconomy”, that is, the minds of our people. African \r\nnations must groom young people to think critically \r\nand creatively — especially given the fact that \r\n60 per cent of the continent is under the age of \r\n24 — as they, like all nations, must rely on human \r\ncapacity, rather than scarce resources, to build thriving \r\nknowledge-based economies.\r\nThrough Israel’s Agency for Development \r\nCooperation, Israel works with African partner \r\ncountries, United Nations agencies, civil society \r\nand the private sector to further education and \r\ntraining, which is a key platform in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s progress report on the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (A/72/223). Israel’s Agency for \r\nDevelopment Cooperation programmes are based on a \r\n“train the trainers” approach to institutional and human \r\ncapacity-building, with professional training courses \r\nconducted in Israel and on site.\r\nIn December 2016, Israel hosted a three-day \r\nministerial conference with African agriculture \r\nministers. That was followed by a training session on \r\nA/72/PV.33 20/10/2017\r\n12/24 17-33710\r\napplied research in agriculture for agriculture experts. \r\nIn March 2017, in collaboration with the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, we \r\nhosted a large delegation from Africa for a study tour \r\non green growth and climate change in arid lands, \r\ntopics of concern for both Israel and African nations. \r\nKnowledge gained from those seminars will be useful \r\nin making progress on the African Union’s vision for \r\nproviding support for 25 million farming households \r\nso that they can employ climate-smart agricultural \r\npractices by 2025.\r\nWhether it be running seminars on entrepreneurship, \r\npartnering with UNICEF schools to teach children about \r\ninnovation and technology, joining with UN-Women to \r\nbuild programmes on women’s economic empowerment \r\nor establishing emergency trauma units and conducting \r\nmedical operations to alleviate blindness, the \r\nGovernment of Israel and our civil society are making \r\na real difference in the lives of people across Africa and \r\nits youth in particular.\r\nWhile time does not permit me to elaborate on \r\nall of the projects and partnerships between African \r\nStates and Israel, I want to highlight one in particular. \r\nThe Israeli non-governmental organization (NGO) \r\nInnovation Africa is on a mission to bring innovative \r\nIsraeli solar energy and water technologies to remote \r\nAfrican villages. Active in over eight African countries, \r\nthat Israeli NGO has already provided 1 million people \r\nacross Africa with access to light and water.\r\nIsrael’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the African Union \r\nAgenda 2063 focuses on sharing best practices through \r\nglobal partnerships. Through the exchange of ideas and \r\nstrategies, our nations can address mutual challenges \r\ntogether using sustainable solutions. We stand with our \r\nAfrican partners to build a brighter future.\r\nMr. Kononuchenko (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): Despite continued weak global economic \r\ngrowth and the many crisis situations on the continent, \r\nAfrican countries have demonstrated a resolute \r\ncommitment to achieving the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and Agenda 2063 of the African Union. \r\nSignificant efforts have been focused on elaborating \r\nnational political strategies for mobilizing domestic \r\nresources, broadening private-public partnerships and \r\nsimplifying investment legislation.\r\nIt is troubling to see that the Secretary-General’s \r\nlatest progress report (A/72/223) notes a 3 per cent \r\ndecrease in foreign direct investment on the continent \r\nin 2016. We are of the view that African countries need \r\nsupport to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, without which the threat of reversing the \r\nprogress achieved in recent years is very real.\r\nThe Russian Federation takes a responsible \r\napproach to its role as a partner for African development \r\nand plans to continue to increase its cooperation \r\nwith the continent. Russia continuously provides \r\nintergovernmental assistance through initiatives aimed \r\nat assisting the poorest, highly indebted countries and \r\nhas forgiven more than $20 billion in African debt. \r\nMoreover, it uses innovative mechanisms to ease the \r\ndebt burden through debt-for-development schemes. \r\nSuch agreements have been signed with Tanzania, \r\nZambia, Mozambique and Ethiopia.\r\nAs a donor facilitating international development, \r\nour country is carrying out projects to ensure food \r\nsecurity and to improve industrial and transport \r\ninfrastructure through response programmes, funds \r\nand other specialized United Nations bodies. One of the \r\nkey channels for that is the World Food Programme. In \r\n2017, the recipients of Russian assistance were Namibia, \r\nKenya, Somalia, and the Sudan.\r\nWe support the community health-care sector: in \r\n2015, the Russian Federation was one of the first to react \r\nand respond to the Ebola fever outbreak by allocating \r\nmore than $60 million. At the medical centre opened by \r\nRussia in Guinea, a vaccine developed in our country is \r\nbeing tested, with professional training courses being \r\nheld for local specialists. That is particularly important \r\nfor improving the response to outbreaks of infectious \r\ndiseases. Through UNICEF, more than $5 million has \r\nbeen allocated for a vaccine campaign in Angola to \r\nprotect people from yellow fever.\r\nWe consider that the World Health Assembly’s \r\ndecision to appoint a representative of Africa — Tedros \r\nAdhanom Ghebreyesus — as the new Director-\r\nGeneral of the World Health Organization was a \r\ntimely one. Russia has supported South Africa’s \r\ninitiative to organize a high-level meeting to combat \r\ntuberculosis in 2018. We plan to participate actively in \r\nthe preparations for that meeting by holding a global \r\nministerial conference on the topic in Moscow on \r\n16 and 17 November, in which we invite Member States \r\nto take part.\r\nAfrica’s future development largely depends on \r\nthe development of the continent’s production capacity \r\n20/10/2017 A/72/PV.33\r\n17-33710 13/24\r\nand trade opportunities. Our delegation accordingly \r\nendorsed the adoption of the Third Industrial \r\nDevelopment Decade for Africa. In our view, the United \r\nNations Industrial Development Organization will play \r\na key role in carrying out the work of that 10-year plan.\r\nIndustrialization is impossible without ensuring \r\nthat States on the continent have access to cutting-\r\nedge technologies. We therefore value establishing a \r\ntechnology bank for least-developed countries. In order \r\nto integrate Africa into international markets, it is \r\nclear that greater attention must be paid to developing \r\nits infrastructure. In that regard, we welcomed the \r\nopening of the regional central branch of the Brazil, \r\nRussia, India, China and South Africa Development \r\nBank in Johannesburg. We trust that it will generate \r\nadditional opportunities for the entire continent with \r\nregard to establishing and implementing large-scale \r\ninfrastructure projects. That is fully in line with plans \r\nset out in the Group of 20 Communiqué at the Hangzhou \r\nSummit, which was aimed at supporting inclusive and \r\nsustainable structural transformations in Africa.\r\nWe believe that the continent has enormous \r\npotential in terms of both natural and human resources. \r\nIt would be a grave error not to use them for the benefit \r\nof all humankind. We therefore call on the international \r\ncommunity, in particular the United Nations system, to \r\nprovide the necessary assistance to the region so as to \r\nimplement the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063.\r\nMr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): The \r\nKingdom of Morocco aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nGroup of African States.\r\nThe Moroccan delegation welcomes the adoption \r\nof the Framework for a Renewed United Nations-\r\nAfrican Union Partnership on Africa’s Integration \r\nand Development Agenda 2017-2027, and hopes \r\nthat the Framework, which will provide the road \r\nmap for strengthening cooperation between the \r\ntwo organizations, will be able to draw on effective \r\nmonitoring mechanisms so as to ensure the achievement \r\nof the development goals set out by the African Union’s \r\nAgenda 2063. In that regard, my delegation remains \r\nconvinced that only joint African efforts based on \r\nstrong regional coordination will enable African \r\ncountries to overcome the challenges they face relating \r\nto sustainable development and peace and security.\r\nAs the report of the Secretary-General (A/72/223) \r\non the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) has underscored, despite the progress made \r\nin recent years in the areas of economic and social \r\ndevelopment, obstacles continue to impede efforts to \r\nreach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and \r\nto implement Agenda 2063. Among those obstacles \r\nis the problem of financing the implementation of the \r\nNEPAD programme, which, if left unresolved, could \r\nhinder the achievement of the goals of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063. Indeed, \r\nthe financing capacity of most African Governments \r\nis limited.\r\nThat situation is aggravated by a situation where \r\nwe have a scarcity of funding resources, international \r\nfinancial markets that are difficult to access, and \r\na decrease in official development assistance. It is \r\ntherefore important to establish, together with African \r\ncountries, a new phase of international cooperation \r\nand partnership for sustainable development in its \r\nthree dimensions based on the principle of shared \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities so as to create \r\nmore opportunities for enlisting the necessary \r\nfinancial resources.\r\nIn that context, my delegation believes that \r\nencouraging investment, developing infrastructure, \r\nimproving market access, and facilitating technology \r\ntransfer and debt relief are key to achieving the \r\neconomic emergence of African countries. Moreover, \r\nstrengthening the private sector will help diversify \r\nAfrican economies, improve added value and create \r\nemployment and income opportunities. It is also \r\nimportant that the pledges made in connection with \r\nofficial development assistance, which is a significant \r\nsource of financing for development — especially for \r\nleast-developed African countries — be honoured.\r\nAdapting agriculture in Africa is an essential \r\ncomponent for ensuring food security. For that reason, \r\nappropriately adapting agriculture requires the \r\nimplementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange through capacity-building, technology transfer, \r\nand the financing of climate-related activities. The \r\ntwenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange (COP 22), held in Marrakech, provided an \r\nopportunity for a broader discussion on how to involve all \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental actors, including \r\nfinancial institutions, in climate-related activities.\r\nIn that context, the solemn declaration adopted by \r\nAfrican leaders and Heads of State at the African Action \r\nA/72/PV.33 20/10/2017\r\n14/24 17-33710\r\nSummit, held on the sidelines of COP 22, reflects the \r\ncommitment of African leaders to defend their shared \r\nstance on combating climate change and its effects, \r\nparticularly desertification. In that spirit, my country \r\nhas facilitated the initiative known as the Adaptation \r\nof African Agriculture, which is aimed at developing \r\nsolutions based on resilience for farmers across the \r\nAfrican continent, while taking into account the impact \r\nof climate change on agriculture.\r\nMorocco has promoted South-South cooperation \r\nand the development of intra-African trade and \r\ninvestment as a fundamental pillar of its economic \r\ncooperation policy in its sphere of influence in Africa. \r\nAccordingly, Morocco has launched partnerships \r\nand cooperation programmes together with African \r\ncountries in numerous areas, such as education, health, \r\ninfrastructure, agriculture and vocational training. \r\nIn addition, Morocco’s relations with the African \r\ncontinent have enjoyed unprecedented growth over \r\nthe last decade, thanks to the numerous visits made by \r\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI to several African \r\ncountries, thereby strengthening our relations. At \r\nthe same time, together with the cooperative efforts \r\ninitiated by the Moroccan Government and the \r\nMoroccan Agency for International Cooperation with \r\nthe countries of Africa, Moroccan private enterprises \r\nhave increased their investments in key development \r\nsectors on the continent, such as air and sea transport, \r\nbanking, housing, telecommunications and tourism.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate Morocco’s \r\ncommitment to strengthening South-South and \r\ntriangular cooperation, which encourages partnerships \r\nthat promote financing, spur growth and create jobs so \r\nas to achieve the priority goals of the African continent. \r\nMorocco will also be active in supporting efforts aimed \r\nat significantly contributing to the implementation of \r\nNEPAD and Agenda 2063 programmes, based on an \r\nintegrated and coherent approach aimed at implementing \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and bringing about \r\na lasting peace that prioritizes prevention by addressing \r\nthe root causes of conflict.\r\nMs. Krisnamurthi (Indonesia): Indonesia aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative \r\nof Brunei Darussalam on behalf of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations. My delegation wishes to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his reports (A/72/223 \r\nand A/72/269), which highlight the progress achieved in \r\nthe implementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and the major developments \r\nregarding peace and security and their interlinkage \r\nwith sustainable development in Africa, respectively.\r\nThe impacts of the global financial crisis continue \r\nto cast a shadow over many countries. The pace \r\nof recovery is uneven across the globe, even as we \r\nwitnessed a modest strengthening of global economic \r\nactivities in the beginning of 2017. Growth on the \r\nAfrican continent is expected to reach 2.6 per cent this \r\nyear, but there needs to be more rapid growth so that \r\nAfrican countries can accelerate their efforts to reach \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\r\nPrior to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, African countries had already \r\nset their own developmental targets under the African \r\nUnion’s Agenda 2063. We must now strive together and \r\nsynergize efforts to achieve the targets for the people \r\nin Africa. The pursuit of sustainable development in \r\nAfrica should be a collective endeavour. We all share \r\nthe responsibility to ensure that African countries are \r\nnot left behind. To that end, my delegation would like \r\nto highlight the following points.\r\nFirst, we must enhance international cooperation \r\nso as to mobilize financing for development in Africa. \r\nThe Secretary-General’s latest report on progress in \r\nimplementing NEPAD (A/72/223) noted that financing \r\nremains a serious challenge to the implementation of \r\nthe NEPAD agenda and, unless addressed, is likely to \r\npose challenges to the implementation of the United \r\nNations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as \r\nwell. The continuous provision of technical assistance \r\nand capacity-building is needed to mobilize domestic \r\nresources and combat illicit financial f lows, strengthen \r\nthe recovery and return of stolen assets, broaden tax \r\nbases and attract investment.\r\nEqually crucial is the fulfilment of all official \r\ndevelopment assistance commitments and other \r\nconcessional financing by development partners. \r\nEfforts must be made to preserve the debt-sustainability \r\nof African countries, especially those impacted by \r\nconflicts and natural disasters, thus freeing up resources \r\nfor development and poverty eradication.\r\nSecondly, we must promote initiatives that \r\ngenerate inclusive and sustained growth. The \r\nimportance of infrastructure in promoting the \r\nintegration of the global economy cannot be \r\noverstated. Infrastructure-development projects in \r\nAfrican countries must be supported. We must foster \r\npartnerships to support industrialization in Africa in \r\n20/10/2017 A/72/PV.33\r\n17-33710 15/24\r\nline with the Third Industrial Development Decade \r\nfor Africa for the period 2016-2025, recognizing its \r\npotential to generate employment, increase income and \r\nfurther economic diversification.\r\nThirdly, we must strive to enhance collaboration \r\nbetween the United Nations and the African continent \r\nin the area of sustainable development. NEPAD and \r\nthe African Union’s Agenda 2063 are integral to the \r\nUnited Nations 2030 Agenda. Indonesia looks forward \r\nto the further mainstreaming of those strategies in the \r\noperational activities of the United Nations development \r\nsystem, and we also look forward to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s December report on how the United Nations \r\nmust be repositioned to better support national efforts, \r\nincluding those of African countries, in achieving \r\nthe SDGs.\r\nIndonesia has always been a true partner of African \r\ncountries, including in their struggle for independence, \r\nas manifested by the convening of the Asian-African \r\nConference in 1955 in Bandung. Indonesia co-initiated \r\nthe New Asia Africa Strategic Partnership to promote \r\ncooperation in various fields between the two regions. \r\nAfrican countries are among the top recipients of \r\nIndonesia’s South-South cooperation programme, \r\nwhich is based on the principles of equality, mutual \r\nrespect and non-conditionality, and is demand-driven.\r\nAt the Group of 20 Summit in Hamburg this \r\nyear, our President announced his intention to further \r\ntransform political ties between Indonesia and Africa \r\ninto concrete economic ties. To that end, Indonesia \r\nwill host the Indonesia-Africa Forum in 2018 to \r\nexplore economic opportunities, strengthen technical \r\ncooperation and enhance the existing partnership \r\nbetween both sides.\r\nMr. Gumende (Mozambique): Allow me to start \r\nby congratulating Mr. David Mehdi Hamam, Acting \r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Africa, \r\nand his staff for the successful convening of Africa \r\nWeek 2017, an annual event that brings together all \r\nrelevant stakeholders in the quest for ways and means to \r\nadvance synergies and partnerships aimed at addressing \r\nthe prevailing challenges aff licting the development of \r\nAfrican countries and their peoples.\r\nI also take this opportunity to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral António Guterres for the two reports under \r\nconsideration (A/72/223 and A/72/269), as they provide \r\na clear picture of the efforts undertaken by African \r\ncountries and their partners, including the United \r\nNations system, to implement the commitments under \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\nand the African Union’s Agenda 2063: The Africa We \r\nWant. The complementarity between those continental \r\ninstruments and the United Nations Agenda 2030 on \r\nSustainable Development is also very well highlighted.\r\nI seize this opportunity to express the alignment \r\nof Mozambique with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States.\r\nSince its inception, the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development has provided us with exceptional \r\nopportunities to improve capacities and policies, with a \r\nview to delivering results in important socioeconomic \r\nareas and promoting public and private partnerships \r\nthat add to the growing confidence in our ability to \r\nlead Africa on the path to socioeconomic development, \r\npeace and stability.\r\nThe adoption of Agenda 2063 and the approval of \r\nits 13 f lagship projects also bear witness to our resolve \r\nto be the subjects and owners of our own destinies. We \r\nbelieve that the strategic impacts of those home-grown \r\nsolutions will provide quick wins, with the potential \r\nto improve the positive trends in Africa with regard to \r\nits economic growth rates, political stability and the \r\nstrengthening of democratic institutions and results \r\nin the social sphere. In our endeavours, the support \r\nof development partners is key to helping Africa \r\nsuccessfully address the prevailing challenges.\r\nTherefore, while we are encouraged by the modest \r\nincrease in the levels of official development assistance \r\nto Africa, from $15.3 billion in 2014 to $56.6 billion in \r\n2015, we are concerned by the fact that, since 2010, the \r\nincrease has been due mainly to the cost of humanitarian \r\naid and the hosting of refugees in donor countries. \r\nIn addition, the continued decline in foreign direct \r\ninvestment (FDI) f lows to Africa is a source of concern, \r\ngiven its role in the development of infrastructure. We \r\ntherefore look at the financial commitments made at \r\nUnited Nations conferences, including in the Addis \r\nAbaba Action Agenda of the Third International \r\nConference on Financing for Development, with hope.\r\nThe call for action to implement Agenda 2063 \r\nreminds us that agriculture continues to be a major \r\ndriver of development and source of livelihood in \r\nAfrica, particularly in rural areas, where the majority \r\nof our people live. In that vein, our efforts to eradicate \r\npoverty also address the need to modernize agriculture. \r\nA/72/PV.33 20/10/2017\r\n16/24 17-33710\r\nExperience proves that, with the right policies and \r\nsupport, progress in promoting sustainable agriculture \r\nand combating malnutrition is possible.\r\nTherefore, at the national level, our 2015-2019 \r\nfive-year agricultural plan was defined as the basis \r\nfor development, owing to the fact that 88 per cent \r\nof Mozambicans rely on agriculture. Therefore, the \r\nStrategic Plan for the Development of the Agrarian \r\nSector (PEDSA) for 2011-2020 strongly supports the \r\nfamily sector, which still comprises the largest number \r\nof agricultural workers. PEDSA also includes high-\r\nproductivity farming systems in the six sectors that \r\nwork with regional and international markets. With \r\nPEDSA, we also aim to support food production and \r\ncash crops so as to supply agriculture inputs, crop \r\nprotection, institutional capacity and the promotion of \r\nresearch on the agriculture sector.\r\nWe are committed to continuing to encourage the \r\nparticipation of various stakeholders, including women \r\nand youth. In our view, community empowerment \r\nis essential, owing to the capacity that it provides \r\nin improving the welfare of the most vulnerable and \r\nprotecting the environment.\r\nAs part of food security and nutrition policies, \r\nMozambique established a national coordination \r\nframework, whose priority actions include: increasing \r\nlocal production of adequate food to meet nutritional \r\nneeds in terms of quantity and quality, improving \r\nthe capacity of individuals and families to provide \r\nsufficient resources to purchase food suitable for their \r\nneeds, strengthening nutrition surveillance systems, \r\nimproving the access of households to sources of safe \r\ndrinking water and energy resources, creating and \r\ncontrolling food standards that ensure food safety and \r\ngood human nutrition, including food and nutrition \r\nsecurity and the human right to adequate food in \r\nschool curriculums.\r\nAchieving agriculture development and food \r\nsecurity and nutrition goals demands investment \r\ncapacity to create national resilience and holistic, \r\nmulti-sectoral coordination. It also requires adequate \r\nf lows of FDI.\r\nAs part of our national five-year plan, the \r\nGovernment of Mozambique is fully committed to \r\nproviding high-quality health care to its people. In \r\nfact, the national health system has shown significant \r\nimprovements over the past decade with efforts to \r\nreduce imbalances and improve the availability of \r\ndrugs. Major progress has also been made in child \r\nimmunization, and overall access to health services has \r\nsubstantially increased.\r\nDespite that progress, Mozambique still faces \r\ndaunting challenges in addressing malaria and the HIV/\r\nAIDS epidemic. Malaria remains a great concern in our \r\ndevelopment efforts, as it accounts for a high percentage \r\nof Mozambique’s disease burden, with children under \r\n5, pregnant women, socially disadvantaged groups and \r\npeople living with HIV/AIDS being the most vulnerable.\r\nAs part of Mozambique’s development plan, the \r\nMinistry for Health is actively engaged in establishing \r\nparticipative and integrated strategies to mitigate the \r\nimpact of diseases that directly affect the social and \r\neconomic structure. It also has a strategy in place \r\nthat combines efforts to secure more f lexible, better \r\ntrained health personnel, as well as a close-monitoring \r\nmechanism for malaria eradication. As a result, \r\nMozambique has made significant steps towards the \r\nreduction of malaria incidence and has increased the \r\nnumber of health units capable of performing malaria \r\ndiagnosis on the spot. Our efforts are geared towards \r\nmeasures aimed at increasing the collective awareness \r\nof good practices with a view to eliminating the scourge \r\nof malaria.\r\nIn efforts to address malaria, partnerships are \r\nof the essence. To that end, Mozambique joined \r\nthe Southern African Development Community’s \r\nMalaria Elimination Framework, which includes the \r\neight countries that signed the Malaria Elimination \r\nAgreement in 2009, setting 2020 as a target for malaria \r\neradication. That regional approach played a pivotal \r\nrole in strengthening the ongoing transborder initiatives \r\nand their sustainability.\r\nGuided by the NEPAD agenda, Mozambique is \r\ncommitted to good governance. In that context, we \r\nadhered to the African Peer Review Mechanism in \r\nMarch 2003, followed by the submission of progress \r\nreports in 2014 and 2015. The country is undertaking \r\nits second evaluation, which will be concluded and \r\nsubmitted by mid-2018.\r\nI would like to conclude this statement by stressing \r\nour unwavering commitment to fulfilling the pan-\r\nAfrican vision of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful \r\nAfrica, driven by its own citizens and representing a \r\ndynamic force in the international arena. That is the \r\nAfrica we want, this is the Africa we seek to build for \r\nthe next generations, this is the Africa we hope our \r\n20/10/2017 A/72/PV.33\r\n17-33710 17/24\r\npartners will continue to support. The Government of \r\nMozambique remains committed to accelerating and \r\nredoubling its efforts.\r\nMr. Sinirlioğlu (Turkey): I thank you, Sir, for \r\norganizing this debate. I congratulate the Office of \r\nthe Special Adviser on Africa for organizing the \r\n2017 Africa Week at the United Nations. I also thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his substantive reports \r\n(A/72/223 and A/72/269) on the progress achieved in \r\nthe implementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and on the causes of conflict \r\nin Africa.\r\nI would like to begin by commending the efforts of \r\nthe African countries, the African Union and African \r\nsubregional organizations, including the NEPAD \r\nPlanning and Coordination Agency, which contribute \r\nto the development and maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity on the continent. Despite tremendous \r\nchallenges, Africa is making great strides towards \r\nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals, while \r\ntrying to find African-led solutions to the ongoing \r\ncrises in various parts of the continent. Africa’s \r\nincreasing economic growth and its genuine initiatives \r\nto prevent and solve its crises deserve the support of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nTurkey’s Africa Partnership Policy fully embraces \r\nthe principle of African solutions to African issues. We \r\nbelieve that the African people and African Governments \r\nhave the best knowledge and the most suitable answers to \r\ntheir problems. With its expertise and capacity, Turkey \r\nremains determined to assist the African countries in \r\ntheir efforts. Turkey, as a strategic partner of Africa, \r\nhas joined the African countries in their development \r\nefforts with substantive infrastructure programmes and \r\nprojects and humanitarian assistance. Turkey also plays \r\nan important part in supporting security and stability in \r\nAfrica through its participation in United Nations field \r\nmissions and through its bilateral engagements.\r\nTurkey has diversified and significantly increased \r\nits assistance to Africa in recent years. The Global \r\nHumanitarian Assistance Report 2016 ranked Turkey \r\nthe second-largest donor country worldwide with its \r\n$6 billion in humanitarian spending. Turkey ranks first \r\nin terms of its official humanitarian assistance ratio by \r\nnational income.\r\nTurkey has multiplied its official development \r\nassistance to sub-Saharan Africa more than a \r\nhundredfold since 2005. While taking critical initiatives \r\nto alleviate the suffering of crisis-stricken African \r\nnations, Turkey focuses on capacity development and \r\ninstitution-building in many African countries. Turkish \r\ndevelopment efforts are not limited to infrastructure \r\nprojects and include capacity-building through \r\neducation and vocational training, which have a \r\ngenuine impact.\r\nThose capacity-building efforts stretch across \r\nall fields, including macroeconomic management, \r\nland surveys, urbanization projects, agricultural \r\nproductivity, medical treatment and hospital management, \r\ncommunication and information technologies and \r\ntransport. Education is a field of advanced cooperation \r\nbetween Turkey and its African counterparts. Yesterday, \r\nwe hosted education ministers from African countries \r\nin Istanbul at the Turkey-Africa Education Ministries \r\nConference. Each year, Turkey provides around 1,000 \r\nhigher-education scholarships to African students. \r\nThere are several technical training programmes carried \r\nout by various Turkish Ministries and Government \r\nagencies, either in Turkey or in Africa.\r\nLocal capacity increase is key in Turkey’s \r\ndevelopment assistance strategy. For instance, the \r\nvocational training centre, established by the Turkish \r\nCooperation and Coordination Agency in Khartoum, \r\nprovides necessary skill sets for the youth and \r\ncontributes to the f lourishing of local economies. The \r\ncentre has so far provided training to more than 15,000 \r\nyoung people in 10 different sectors.\r\nTurkey also shares its expertise in agriculture, a \r\nkey sector for Africa’s development, through vocational \r\ntraining programmes, experience-sharing and best-\r\npractices courses held in Turkey. Infrastructure \r\nprojects, such as the construction of roads, ports, \r\nirrigation systems and schools, are important for \r\ncapacity-building and improving basic services, food \r\nsecurity and human-resources development in African \r\ncountries. Turkey provides African Governments and \r\nlocal authorities with grants and technical assistance \r\nfor infrastructure projects and supports the African \r\nprivate-sector initiatives through EXIMBANK loans \r\nand other facilities.\r\nWith that understanding, Turkey is building \r\nor rehabilitating dams for agricultural irrigation \r\nand water management in the Horn of Africa. Our \r\nCooperation Agency, in collaboration with Turkish and \r\nlocal non-governmental organizations, is establishing \r\nagriculture schools and greenhouses in Somalia, \r\nA/72/PV.33 20/10/2017\r\n18/24 17-33710\r\nSudan and other parts of Africa. Two research and \r\ntraining hospitals that Turkey constructed in Darfur \r\nand Mogadishu in 2014 and 2015, respectively, are \r\ngood examples of Turkey’s determination to fulfil \r\nits unwavering commitment to Africa, even under \r\ndifficult conditions. Turkey also collaborates with \r\nAfrican small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \r\nto carry out sustainable development projects aimed \r\nat strengthening industrialization and job creation \r\nin various African countries. In that connection, we \r\nalso organize training programmes and field trips for \r\nAfrican SMEs in Turkey.\r\nWe know that overall stabilization and socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment efforts in Africa cannot succeed without \r\neconomic empowerment and the active engagement \r\nof women and youth. In that context, Turkey \r\nimplements joint projects with the African Union and \r\nAfrican countries for the capacity-building of young \r\nentrepreneurs, including women. Turkey organizes \r\ncomprehensive training programmes and field trips in \r\ncooperation with the African Union on entrepreneurship, \r\nbusiness start-ups, development and capacity-building. \r\nOne such event, designed for Somali women and young \r\nentrepreneurs, was held within the framework of the \r\nSomali High-level Partnership Forum, which took place \r\nin Istanbul in 2016. The Bazaar Africa, which opened \r\nin 2016, gave visibility to the economic capacity and \r\nproductivity of African women.\r\nAn extensive network composed of 39 Turkish \r\nembassies, development agencies across the continent, \r\nTurkish Airlines and Turkish businessmen’s associations \r\nacross the continent play an active role in efforts to \r\nhelp African countries tap Africa’s real economic and \r\nbusiness potential in order to create an environment \r\nconducive to peace and prosperity. That network is \r\npresent in many crisis-affected regions of Africa and is \r\ndoing a great job for the African people.\r\nMr. Suan (Myanmar): It has been almost two \r\ndecades since the inception of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD). It is a collective \r\nvision and strategic framework for African countries \r\nthat has the aim of eliminating poverty and achieving \r\na sustainable path of growth and development on \r\nthe continent.\r\nOver the years, we have witnessed encouraging \r\nprogress made by many African countries. Nevertheless, \r\nmany challenges remain to be addressed. Some \r\nAfrican countries are still grappling with economic \r\nuncertainty, political instability, poor connectivity \r\nand infrastructure, climate change and natural \r\ndisasters, which impede the achievement of sustainable \r\ndevelopment on the continent.\r\nWe are encouraged by the impressive progress made \r\nby the Programme for Infrastructure Development \r\nin Africa (PIDA), which focuses on 16 cross-border \r\nprojects. It will further strengthen connectivity among \r\nAfrican countries. The successful implementation \r\nof PIDA will contribute to reaching NEPAD’s goals \r\nof promoting accelerated growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, eradicating widespread and severe \r\npoverty, and halting the marginalization of Africa in \r\nthe globalization process.\r\nDespite the adverse effects that weak global \r\neconomic conditions have on Africa’s growth \r\nperformance, African countries continue to make \r\nprogress in the implementation of the priorities of \r\nNEPAD, particularly in the areas of infrastructure, \r\nagriculture and gender mainstreaming. While some \r\nAfrican countries are experiencing infrastructure \r\ndevelopment, the Secretary-General, in his report \r\non progress in implementing the NEPAD agenda \r\n(A/72/223), pointed out that African countries need \r\nto undertake the reforms necessary to attract local \r\nand foreign private-sector partners for investment \r\nin infrastructure, including through the creation of \r\nenabling regulatory and legal frameworks. I strongly \r\nbelieve that such reforms will bring more foreign \r\ninvestors to the region. At the same time, I would like \r\nto urge development partners to support infrastructure \r\ndevelopment in Africa through financing and capacity-\r\nbuilding.\r\nAsia and Africa are the continents of opportunities \r\nand challenges. Given the similarity of the development \r\npaths of our two continents, we recognize tremendous \r\npotential in our collaboration for mutual benefit in \r\nmany areas through South-South cooperation and the \r\nNew Asian-African Strategic Partnership.\r\nMyanmar was one of the leading countries in \r\nbuilding friendship and solidarity among Asian and \r\nAfrican countries more than six decades ago, as it was \r\none of the organizers for the historic Asian-African \r\nConference, which is better known as the Bandung \r\nConference. As Myanmar and African friends have \r\ndeep-rooted traditional relationships, Myanmar will \r\ncontinue to stand firmly in supporting NEPAD’s \r\n20/10/2017 A/72/PV.33\r\n17-33710 19/24\r\nobjectives of political stability, high economic growth \r\nand sustainable development.\r\nMyanmar, like many countries in Africa, lagged \r\nbehind in development owing to decades of internal \r\narmed conflict. Since the new Government came \r\ninto office in March 2016, we have set peace and \r\nnational reconciliation as top priorities, with the aim \r\nof establishing a democratic federal union. Significant \r\nprogress has been achieved in the peace process. \r\nPeace and stability are prerequisites for sustainable \r\neconomic development.\r\nOn the economic front, Myanmar has opened its \r\ndoors to responsible foreign investment, which could \r\nprovide much-needed employment opportunities. \r\nMyanmar’s 12-point economic policy has been crafted \r\nto achieve many of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, including poverty alleviation, the enhancement \r\nof infrastructure investment, as well as investment in \r\nagriculture, the private sector and small and medium-\r\nsized enterprises. At the same time, we are reaching out \r\nto the international community for a new approach that \r\nwill deepen engagement and cooperation at both the \r\nbilateral and the multilateral levels. Myanmar therefore \r\nlooks forward to enhancing our engagements with our \r\nAfrican friends in their development endeavours within \r\nthe framework of South-South cooperation.\r\nTo conclude, we would like to reiterate our support \r\nfor the full and effective implementation of NEPAD, \r\nthe United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the African Union’s Agenda 2063 \r\nfor promoting peace and development in Africa, while \r\nbuilding a mutual understanding that is based on our \r\nfriendship and cooperation through the Bandung spirit \r\nof Afro-Asian solidarity.\r\nMr. Boukadoum (Algeria): I thank you, Sir, for \r\npersonally presiding over today’s meeting. It shows your \r\ninterest in Africa, and I would like to convey my thanks \r\nfor that. The debate on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) is very dear and crucial to my \r\ncontinent, and my country cherishes the opportunity to \r\nshare its views with the entire membership.\r\nI would like to start by saying that in addition to \r\naligning ourselves with the statement delivered by \r\nthe representative of Egypt on behalf of the Group \r\nof African States, I would like to add the following \r\nremarks in my national capacity.\r\nWe note with appreciation the findings and \r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General, in particular the report on progress \r\nin the implementation of and international support for \r\nNEPAD (A/72/223). We also wish to thank the Office \r\nof the Special Adviser on Africa for its dedication and \r\nvaluable work in enhancing international support for \r\nAfrica’s development. I also wish to commend the work \r\nof the Economic Commission for Africa, which has \r\ncalled for enhanced cooperation with the African Union.\r\nAs indicated in the Secretary-General’s report, \r\nAfrican countries are working to mainstream the United \r\nNations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nthe African Union’s Agenda 2063 into their national \r\ndevelopment frameworks. While being convinced of \r\nthe multiple benefits of regional integration, African \r\ncountries have made significant progress on the \r\nestablishment of a continental free trade area, which we \r\nhope will facilitate economic exchanges, create decent \r\njobs, help to mobilize domestic resources and attract \r\nextra-continental f lows of funds needed for investments, \r\nin particular for infrastructure and development.\r\nHaving said that, what is needed most is the \r\nconcrete mobilization of domestic resources in African \r\ncountries. The international community should support \r\nthe continent in achieving a sustainable growth that is \r\nbased on a domestic production system, an effective tax-\r\ncollection administration and strengthened capacity-\r\nbuilding. Africa needs to benefit from improved \r\nmarket access, particularly to markets in the developed \r\ncountries, which are called upon to show more \r\nopenness to supporting Africa’s development efforts \r\nand its inclusion in the international system. The voices \r\nheard in some wealthy countries, calling for economic \r\nstabilization measures, could raise some difficulties, \r\nas we fear that certain proposed measures will end up \r\ncreating new obstacles for the effective contribution of \r\nAfrica to the world economy.\r\nThe issue of the transfer of technology remains a \r\nlong-standing, lingering issue. Productive investment \r\nis investment that opens up possibilities for the transfer \r\nof technology and is not focused exclusively on material \r\nprofits or stock dividends.\r\nFor more than a decade now, NEPAD has placed \r\nthe questions of peace, security, democracy, good \r\ngovernance, human rights and women’s empowerment at \r\nthe heart of sustainable development. While recognizing \r\nthe political, economic and social difficulties that have \r\nA/72/PV.33 20/10/2017\r\n20/24 17-33710\r\nbeset Africa’s development for decades, NEPAD is also \r\nthe expression of Africa’s determination to establish a \r\nnew partnership anchored in the principles of African \r\nleadership and, above all, ownership.\r\nThe progress that Africa has achieved finds itself \r\nhampered by a variety of factors. The collective actions \r\nundertaken by Africa to fight poverty continue to \r\nsuffer from the backlash caused by a multitude of crises \r\nin various parts of Africa, as well as other setbacks \r\nresulting from the effects of natural disasters, climate \r\nchange — to which Africa has contributed the least of \r\nany region — and volatile commodity prices. Africa’s \r\nresilience can and must be strengthened.\r\nThe international community can contribute \r\ngreatly to that process, and we seize this opportunity to \r\ncall on our partners to fully support the African Union. \r\nLet us remember that Agenda 2063 of the African \r\nUnion and its continental programmes are embedded in \r\nNEPAD. After a decade of implementation, NEPAD, as \r\na programme of the African Union, produced a number \r\nof encouraging results, including the promotion of \r\ninfrastructure development.\r\nWith respect to the implementation of the \r\nTrans-Sahara Highway project championed by Algeria, \r\nthe part that is to be carried out by my country has \r\nrecently been completed. That project will link \r\nAlgeria to Nigeria and will open up the landlocked and \r\ndeprived areas in between the two countries. It will also \r\ncertainly be instrumental to free trade and to enhancing \r\neconomic exchange between the North and the South \r\nof the Sahelo-Saharan region. The other project, an \r\noptic fibre link between Algeria and Nigeria via the \r\nNiger, aimed at connecting Algeria to Nigeria through \r\nthe installation of 4,500 kilometres of terrestrial optic \r\nfibre, will certainly lead to positive spinoffs.\r\nSignificant progress has also been made within \r\nthe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme, to which 50 of the 55 States members of the \r\nAfrican Union have committed themselves, particularly \r\nwith regard to implementing national agriculture and \r\nfood-security investment plans.\r\nThanks to its immense potential, both in human \r\nand natural resources, Africa is the future of the world. \r\nAfrica is a thriving continent that is on the right track, \r\ndespite real and evident setbacks and uncertainties. \r\nAfrica needs to jumpstart its development and has \r\nbegun to do so thanks to national, regional and \r\ncontinental endeavours. Africa needs to be respected \r\nand viewed as a partner, not as a source of problems \r\nor a threat to the comfort of others. History shows that \r\nthe whole world still owes Africa its support in solving \r\nits woes, and we expect Member States to provide their \r\ncooperation, mutual respect, genuine partnership and \r\nsolidarity, which are needed now more than ever.\r\nMs. Guadey (Ethiopia): At the outset, let me thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive report \r\non the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) (A/72/223). Let me also thank the Office \r\nof the Special Adviser on Africa, the Mission of the \r\nAfrican Union, the Economic Commission for Africa, \r\nNEPAD and the United Nations Department of Public \r\nInformation for jointly organizing Africa Week, which \r\nhas given us a unique opportunity to exchange views on \r\nhow to accelerate inclusive and sustainable peace and \r\ndevelopment in Africa. My delegation aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered earlier by the representative of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the African Group.\r\nSince the dawn of the millennium, Africa has been \r\nregistering encouraging economic growth, which has \r\nreduced poverty. As a result of comprehensive policies \r\nimplemented at the national, regional and continental \r\nlevels, Africa continues to be the second-fastest-\r\ngrowing region in the world, meaning that even sceptics \r\nrecognize it as the hopeful and rising continent.\r\nThat does not, of course, mean that Africa was \r\nimmune to the adverse impacts the 2008 global \r\nrecession or the impact of the recent global commodity-\r\nprice volatility, which affected its economic growth. \r\nMoreover, despite the progress achieved in the political \r\nand socioeconomic areas, Africa still continues to face \r\nmultiple challenges that require urgent and concerted \r\nsolutions. That is why the leaders of Africa came together \r\nand endorsed Agenda 2063 of the African Union with a \r\npolitical commitment to build an integrated, prosperous \r\nand peaceful continent that plays its rightful role at the \r\nglobal level.\r\nBuilding on the achievements of past endeavours, \r\nthat ambitious vision of creating the Africa we want \r\nfor current and future generations demonstrates the \r\nunflinching political will and readiness of African \r\nleaders to shape the destiny of the continent for a \r\nmuch better and transformed Africa. Now more than \r\never, Agenda 2063 reflects the shared vision of the \r\npeople of Africa to fully realize the development \r\npotential of the continent, as well as comprehensive \r\npolitical, socioeconomic and cultural development, \r\n20/10/2017 A/72/PV.33\r\n17-33710 21/24\r\nwhile respecting environmental sustainability. Indeed, \r\nAgenda 2063 is an African-led and African-owned \r\nmaster plan, and Africans are committed to assuming \r\nfull responsibility for its implementation in line with \r\nvarying national and regional circumstances.\r\nThe 2063 Agenda is also a comprehensive \r\nframework for partnership with the international \r\ncommunity and a road map for multi-stakeholder \r\ncollaboration with the private sector, civil society and \r\nother development actors. The African Agenda is also \r\nfully aligned with the objectives of the United Nations \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development aimed at \r\nrealizing prosperity for all and leaving no one behind. \r\nTherefore Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda reinforce \r\nand complement each other.\r\nIn order to fully realize the vision of creating a \r\npeaceful and prosperous Africa, it is important to pay \r\nspecial attention to silencing the guns. Africa should \r\nleave no stone unturned in working to achieve that, \r\nfor peace is the prerequisite for Africa’s development, \r\nwhich is indispensable for ensuring sustainable peace \r\nand security on the continent. In that regard, we have \r\nno option but to transform and diversify our economies \r\nthrough inclusive and sustainable industrialization. \r\nThat should be done in a way that could further \r\ntranslate economic growth into poverty reduction and \r\njob creation, as well as into building resilience so as \r\nto address the adverse impacts of external shocks and \r\nclimate change.\r\nWhile it is the primary responsibility of Africa \r\nitself to achieve its development vision, it is clear that, \r\nin an interconnected world, Africa requires an enabling \r\nand supportive global environment. In that regard, let \r\nme emphasize that it is important to enhance financial, \r\ntechnological and capacity-building support for the \r\n2030 and 2063 Agendas in a more coordinated and \r\nenhanced manner.\r\nIn that regard, we commend the cooperation between \r\nthe African Union and the United Nations aimed at \r\nintegrating follow-up and reporting mechanisms. We \r\nalso believe that cooperation and coordination between \r\nthe two organizations should be further consolidated \r\nso as to achieve both of the development frameworks \r\nin line with existing national and regional initiatives. \r\nThe reform agenda of the United Nations should also \r\nconsider the special development needs and challenges \r\nof Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, the messages of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report and the many useful ideas that we have \r\nheard during this Africa Week will help to further foster \r\ninternational partnership in support of the development \r\nefforts of Africa. We hope the Week has provided \r\nus an opportunity to have productive deliberations \r\nbetween Africa and our development partners, thereby \r\ncontributing to the accelerated implementation of \r\nAgenda 2063.\r\nMr. Mero (Tanzania): My delegation aligns itself \r\nwith the statement made by the representative of Egypt \r\non behalf of the Group of African States.\r\nMy delegation wishes to commend you, \r\nMr. President, for your statement, which has encouraged \r\nAfricans to continue to work together to address their \r\nown challenges. It is gratifying that the African Union’s \r\nAgenda 2063, which dovetails with the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, is gaining recognition \r\nacross the globe. We in Africa are determined to \r\neradicate poverty in the short, medium and long term \r\nand to guarantee prosperity to our people. Our resolve \r\nhas come a long way, starting in the African Union \r\nand its subregional organizations with their intent to \r\ngenerate African solutions to surmount current and \r\nfuture challenges. We have always addressed our \r\nchallenges through common purpose and solidarity, be \r\nit in the areas of peace and security, or development and \r\nenvironmental issues.\r\nWe are determined, through partnerships with the \r\ninternational community, to be able, first, to address \r\nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda \r\n2063; secondly, to ensure that we implement the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change; thirdly, to support the \r\nSecretary-General’s reform agenda; and fourthly, to \r\naddress the challenges of peace and security through \r\nregional initiatives, including through partnerships \r\nwith the international community and other partners. \r\nWe continue to believe that addressing infrastructure \r\ndevelopment on the continent and investing in \r\nindustrialization and value addition is a step in the right \r\ndirection. At this juncture, let me thank all cooperating \r\npartners for supporting the continent through the \r\npeace, security and development agenda. Support from \r\npartners is not in vain; it is valued and recognized by \r\nall of us.\r\nIn conclusion, let us work together in order to \r\nsupport the continent as it seeks to integrate itself into \r\nand contribute to the global economic value chain.\r\nA/72/PV.33 20/10/2017\r\n22/24 17-33710\r\nMr. Elnour (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It is my \r\npleasure at the outset to stress that we align ourselves \r\nwith the statement made by the representative of Egypt \r\non behalf of the Group of African States.\r\nIt is also my pleasure to address the Assembly \r\nduring Africa Week, which supports an integrated, \r\nprosperous, people-centred and peaceful Africa. We \r\nsalute our great fathers and grandfathers. We commend \r\nthe attention to and focus on people and their role in \r\nimproving their lives and developing their societies. \r\nWe believe that it is high time for the United Nations, \r\nwhich adopted its Charter in 1945 with the words “We \r\nthe peoples”, to take the initiative and lead the people to \r\npromote their economic, social and cultural rights and \r\nto strengthen the pillars of peace and security.\r\nThe African continent’s contribution to human \r\ncivilization has been proven since the dawn of time on \r\nthis Earth. In fact, various cultures and civilizations \r\nin various parts of Africa, whether in the north, \r\nsouth, centre, west or east, have promoted human \r\ndevelopment. Africa was left behind over the past two \r\ndecades in terms of industrialization and development; \r\nyet it has always played its role, and history has proved \r\nthat Africa set the cornerstone for human civilization. \r\nIn Africa we have significantly contributed to the great \r\ndevelopments of our day.\r\nUnfortunately, over the past several decades, the \r\ndark continent has grown into a region of conflicts. In \r\nfact, bloody armed conflicts have mushroomed, which \r\nhas increased the number of fighter and non-fighter \r\nvictims. Destruction has struck various parts of our \r\ncontinent. We must address the root causes of conflict, \r\nsuch as poverty, the weak rule of law and education \r\nopportunities, and the failure to use our resources. \r\nThose factors have adversely affected the prosperity \r\nand stability of our people. That is why Africa was left \r\nbehind in development. That is also one of the main \r\ncauses of conflict.\r\nIn addition, emerging reasons for conflict, such \r\nas climate change and its significant impact on food \r\nsecurity in many developing African countries, \r\nespecially sub-Saharan Africa, have caused great \r\nconcern for our people. The international community \r\nmust work together to avoid the destructive impact \r\nof climate change. We hope that the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which includes the African \r\nUnion’s vision of socioeconomic development on the \r\ncontinent, will tackle the root causes of conflict so that \r\nAfrica may enjoy sustainable peace and development.\r\nWe salute and commend the efforts of the African \r\nUnion, which adopted its ambitious plan: Agenda 2063. \r\nThat document provides a road map for the development \r\nof Africa and for the promotion of its democracy. \r\nWe also have the pleasure to commend the efforts of \r\nregional organizations, which have played a key part \r\nin that field, such as the Intergovernmental Authority \r\non Development, which includes the States of the Horn \r\nof Africa. As for the Sudan, we must note that we have \r\nmade tangible progress in our efforts to end conflict \r\nand move towards peacebuilding and sustainable peace \r\nin Darfur. We would like to thank all organizations \r\nthat have contributed to the implementation of the \r\nAgreement between the Government of the Sudan and \r\nthe Liberation and Justice Movement for the adoption \r\nof the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur. That \r\nagreement has transformed Darfur from a conflict \r\nregion to a region of peace, stability and security.\r\nI would also like to commend the national \r\ndialogue initiative launched by our Government \r\nwith the participation of all political forces. That \r\nwas done in an effective and serious way in order to \r\nensure comprehensive inclusiveness, transparency \r\nand freedom, and to address the main problems of \r\nthe country, while providing a national document \r\nthat all political parties agreed on. It paved the way \r\nfor a constitutional and political future in line with \r\nconsensual visions and ambitions for addressing social, \r\neconomic and political problems. Its recommendations \r\nand decisions were an achievement that led to the \r\nestablishment of the Government of National Accord, \r\nwhich has been steering the work of our country with \r\nparticipation on the part of all political parties.\r\nIn conclusion, we stress the need to redouble \r\nAfrican efforts to establish a comprehensive strategic \r\npartnership to fight terrorism and ensure political \r\nstability on the African continent, in line with the \r\nCommittee of Intelligence and Security Services of \r\nAfrica Conference held in Khartoum in September, \r\nwith the participation of leaders in the fields of \r\nintelligence and security in Africa. That will help to \r\nachieve the NEPAD agenda and the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. In fact, there can be no \r\nsustainable peace without stability and economic and \r\nhuman development.\r\n20/10/2017 A/72/PV.33\r\n17-33710 23/24\r\nThe President: I now call on the observer of the \r\nAfrican Union.\r\nMr. Mayaki (African Union): I would first like \r\nto convey my warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on \r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-second session.\r\nI am very honoured to speak on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Union (AU), and I would like to thank the \r\nOffice of the Special Adviser on Africa for having \r\norganized a very successful Africa Week. The New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), which \r\nis an African Union programme, is a commitment to \r\naction by Africa’s leaders. Embedded in Agenda 2063: \r\nThe Africa We Want, adopted by the African Union \r\nin 2015, NEPAD continues to be a rallying point in \r\nthe continent’s pursuit of transformation and growth, \r\nwithin particularly key parameters that underline the \r\nsocial and economic empowerment of our people, \r\nwithout exception.\r\nThe continent has settled down and is now fully \r\nfocused on implementing economic growth and \r\ndevelopment strategies within the context of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As we know, \r\nAfrica’s commitments are also specified in Agenda \r\n2063. During this year’s Africa Week, with its theme, \r\n“Supporting an integrated, prosperous, people-centred \r\nand peaceful Africa: Towards the implementation of \r\nAgenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment”, I would like to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to three issues that underline Africa’s \r\nadvances on its socioeconomic pathways.\r\nThe first issue is the demographic factor, \r\nparticularly the issue of youth and youth employment. \r\nWe know from past experience, especially that of the \r\npast decade, that it is not enough for economies to grow \r\nin terms of gross domestic product if that growth is \r\nnot accompanied, at acceptable levels, by growth and \r\ntransformative change in specific human-development \r\nfactors — from jobs and economic opportunities to \r\naccess to education, health, shelter and clean water. \r\nWith a youthful population that has a current median \r\nage of 20 years — expected to rise to 25 years by \r\n2050, which will still be below the global average \r\nof 36 years — it is imperative that Africa break the \r\ngeneration-to-generation poverty cycle that continues \r\nto trap many of our people.\r\nWhile significant progress is being made at the \r\ncontinental and regional levels, as well as within \r\nindividual AU member States, there are challenges \r\nremaining. With an average annual growth rate of \r\n2.5 per cent over the past decade, the demographic \r\nfactors will be central in identifying priority issues \r\nand public-policy options with regard to Africa’s \r\nsocioeconomic pathways. It is no accident that, through \r\nthe theme of this year’s AU Summit, “Harnessing the \r\ndemographic dividend through investments in youth”, \r\nthe African Union dedicated 2017 to making progress \r\non the issue of youth employment. The issue of youth \r\nis not a problem to be eliminated, it is a resource — an \r\neconomic resource to be harnessed.\r\nAn estimated 440 million young people will enter \r\nthe labour market in Africa alone by 2030. The situation \r\nof young people is particularly critical in rural areas, \r\nwhere the lack of decent work opportunities remains \r\npervasive. The majority of rural youth are employed in \r\nthe informal economy as contributing family workers, \r\nsubsistence farmers, home-based micro-entrepreneurs \r\nor unskilled workers, where they typically earn \r\nlow wages and are employed under seasonal work \r\narrangements and usually in unsafe working conditions.\r\nThe African Union Commission, the regional \r\neconomic communities and the NEPAD Agency are \r\ncollaborating on several initiatives that seek to bring \r\nadded value to the actions being taken by AU member \r\nStates to address, on the one hand, employment \r\ncreation and entrepreneurship development, and on the \r\nother, enhance the employability of the youth through \r\nappropriate training. The African Union vocational \r\ntraining and skills-development strategy is already \r\nenabling the youth in many African countries by helping \r\nthem to acquire industry-relevant skills, and in some \r\ncases, entrepreneurship and business-management \r\nskills. Africa needs to rapidly expand its capacity to \r\noffer relevant skills and vocational training to youth \r\nand women.\r\nThe second issue is that of trade. While global \r\ncompetitiveness and trading with the rest of the world \r\nis one of the realities of our globalized world, I would \r\nlike to focus that issue on Africa’s own inter- and \r\nintra-regional trade. The potential capacity to have a \r\nsignificant impact on economic growth is massive and \r\nevident. Through progress on various trade instruments, \r\nfrom regional instruments to decisions and declarations \r\non boosting intra-African trade and the establishment \r\nof a continental free-trade area, Africa has made \r\ncommendable advances towards making a reality \r\nof its clear political ambition to expand the levels of \r\nA/72/PV.33 20/10/2017\r\n24/24 17-33710\r\ncontinental trade. That is an imperative objective for \r\nAfrica if it is to realize the goals and targets set by \r\nAgenda 2063 and the SGDs.\r\nThe need to accelerate progress on the policy \r\nfront is imperative with regard to customs procedures \r\nand visa restrictions, and bringing about the full \r\nratification and use of the African passport. It is equally \r\nimportant to enhance the form, quality and diversity of \r\ntransboundary tradable goods and services.\r\nWithin the context of the African Union \r\nCommission, the NEPAD Agency is determined, \r\nthrough various programmes, to support regional \r\neconomic communities and AU member States in their \r\nefforts to make further advances, including on the \r\npositive trends in governance and the general business \r\nenvironment with regard to macroeconomic policies \r\nand investment options. That should have a tangible \r\nimpact on the capacity and quality of trade-enhancing \r\nfactors, including human-capital development, \r\nstronger and more accountable institutions and better \r\ninfrastructure — especially with regard to transport, \r\ncommunication and electricity.\r\nThe continent is already making progress on major \r\nmotorways and regional railway projects to create \r\ninland connections. Such efforts need to be augmented, \r\nboth in terms of technologies and investment financing. \r\nOne example is the standard-gauge railway that will \r\nconnect Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. \r\nOn the other hand, sea transport is also an important \r\nfeature in Africa’s trade, accounting for close to 90 per \r\ncent of Africa’s trade movements. That implies the \r\nneed to strengthen the functioning of seaports, which \r\nruns from modernization to improved administration. \r\nAnother example is the 4,500-kilometre highway that \r\nwill link Algiers to Lagos.\r\nWithin the global communication context in which \r\nwe live, expanded and widespread Internet penetration \r\ncannot be overemphasized. It is a critical issue, and \r\nAfrica is moving at the same pace as the rest of the world \r\nin building relevant Internet capacity and systems.\r\nMy third and last point is about addressing \r\ninequality. Africa has learned that wealth creation \r\nis important in the pursuit of economic growth and \r\ninclusive development, but equally important and highly \r\ncritical for Africa is the issue of the distribution of that \r\nwealth in order to make sure that growth is inclusive. It \r\nis clear that the world, and the more so Africa, cannot \r\ncontinue to have non-inclusive growth. It is not good \r\nfor business, nor is it good for political stability and \r\nsocial cohesion. It is not good for economic growth. \r\nIt is not good for peace and security. That is an issue \r\nthat has been highlighted by our sister organization, the \r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism (APRM). As Member \r\nStates know, the APRM is a critical instrument for the \r\nimprovement of our governance systems.\r\nWhile inequality, especially as measured in terms \r\nof income and wealth levels, is a global phenomenon, \r\naddressing inequality requires that it be analysed \r\nand understood within the local, socioeconomic and \r\ncultural context. The NEPAD Agency, within the \r\nAfrican Union framework, aims to work with AU \r\nmember States and the United Nations agencies to \r\nproduce a better national understanding of our situation \r\nand to provide ways of measuring inequality. In that \r\ncontext, member States must have access to relevant \r\nanalytical and decision-making tools to guide their \r\npolicies and investments.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to recall one, I believe, \r\nunderlying principle in both the African Union’s Agenda \r\n2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals — the \r\ncommitment to results. The African Union Commission, \r\nthe regional economic communities and the NEPAD \r\nAgency are keen and committed to collaborate with \r\nthe United Nations agencies to support member States \r\nin their efforts to realize their ambition for concrete \r\nchange and impact through their development efforts.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe African Union, through its cooperative \r\nframework with the United Nations, is prepared to \r\nstep up its partnership in order to create conditions \r\nconducive to accelerating swift implementation of the \r\nAfrican Union’s Agenda 2063, which is fully in line \r\nwith the Sustainable Development Goals. The future of \r\nthe world and of Africa will depend on the success of \r\nthat implementation.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on these items.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 66 and its sub-items (a) \r\nand (b) and agenda item 13.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.35 p.m.\r\n"
