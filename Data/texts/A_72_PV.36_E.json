"United Nations A/72/PV.36\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n36th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 30 October 2017, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 76\r\nReport of the International Criminal Court\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/72/349)\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/72/342, \r\nA/72/372 and A/72/372/Corr.1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/72/L.3)\r\nThe President: I am pleased to welcome Her \r\nExcellency Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court, to the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe 1998 Rome Statute is a landmark on the \r\njourney to universal justice and the rule of law. Its \r\nadoption demonstrated our commitment to ending \r\nimpunity for the most serious crimes of concern to the \r\ninternational community. It ref lected a joint resolve \r\nto guarantee lasting respect for and enforcement of \r\ninternational justice.\r\nNow, almost two decades later, we must reaffirm \r\nour determination to stand up for victims and prevent \r\nrecurrence of the most serious crimes. The firm \r\ninternational commitment towards these ends is \r\ndemonstrated by the fact that almost two thirds of United \r\nNations Members are parties to the Rome Statute.\r\nI want to emphasize two elements of the Court’s \r\nwork. The first is the role of the International Criminal \r\nCourt in the delivery of justice. While States retain \r\nthe primary responsibility for exercising criminal \r\njurisdiction over those responsible for serious crimes, \r\nthe International Criminal Court plays a complementary \r\nrole: it acts when national judicial systems have failed \r\nto ensure accountability.\r\nBy fulfilling its functions, the Court carries out a \r\nvital role. It contributes to strengthening accountability, \r\nprotecting human rights and promoting the rule of law. \r\nThese support our ultimate goal of achieving a more \r\npeaceful and just world for all people. However, the \r\ncooperation of States with the Court is critical so as to \r\nenable it to effectively fulfil its mission, as provided for \r\nin the Rome Statute.\r\nThe victims must not be denied the justice they \r\ndeserve. Most have faced the gravest indignity and \r\nabuse, ultimately paying the highest price. Victims and \r\ntheir families have suffered the greatest loss and often \r\ninhuman treatment. Their rights must not be sacrificed \r\non the altar of political expediency. They deserve \r\njustice. If we fail to deliver, we call into question our \r\nown relevance as guarantors of human rights and justice.\r\nThe second element is the preventive impact of the \r\nCourt’s work. From the very beginning, the International \r\nCriminal Court was meant to be an instrument not \r\nonly for the prosecution, but also for the prevention of \r\ninternational crimes. Strengthening the enforcement of \r\ninternational law helps to deter potential perpetrators \r\nfrom carrying out or continuing criminal conduct. \r\nFurthermore, as the Court works to fulfil its mandate \r\nunder the Statute, it supports the work we are doing to \r\npromote justice and the rule of law and to sustain peace.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Achieving its \r\nuniversality was considered a means to guarantee \r\nthat such unimaginable atrocities, which represent \r\na threat to the peace, security and well-being of the \r\nworld, would not go unpunished. Ending impunity is \r\nan important way to prevent future atrocities. All of \r\nus have an obligation to prevent and respond to these \r\ngrave crimes.\r\nAs we consider this agenda item today, I trust we \r\nwill remind ourselves of our common commitment to \r\npeace and international justice.\r\nIt is now my honour to invite Judge Fernández de \r\nGurmendi to take the f loor.\r\nJudge Fernández de Gurmendi (International \r\nCriminal Court) (spoke in Spanish): I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to extend my respectful greetings to \r\nthe Spanish-speaking delegations before proceeding \r\nwith the presentation of my report (see A/72/349) in the \r\ntwo working languages of the Court, which are French \r\nand English.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI am honoured to address the General Assembly to \r\npresent the Court’s annual report to the United Nations \r\nfor the third and last time, as my mandate as President \r\nand Judge of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nwill expire in March 2018.\r\nWhen I first addressed the Assembly two years ago, \r\nfollowing my election as President (see A/70/PV.48), \r\nI emphasized that the main priority I had set for my \r\nmandate was to enhance the Court’s effectiveness and \r\nefficiency. I thought then, and remain convinced today, \r\nthat cooperation is linked to performance. The Court \r\nmust constantly strive to improve its governance, as well \r\nas the speed and quality of the justice that it delivers, in \r\norder to enhance its credibility and foster support.\r\nI am glad to say that much effort has been put into \r\nfulfilling this goal in all organs of the Court, and much \r\nprogress has been made. The judges have sought to \r\nimprove and accelerate judicial proceedings through \r\na collective assessment of the legal framework and \r\nmethods of work. Three retreats of judges have been \r\na central vehicle to foster the development of a more \r\ncohesive judicial culture among the judges of the Court, \r\nwho come from different backgrounds, legal systems \r\nand traditions. These retreats have served to channel \r\ncollegial discussions across Chambers and Divisions, \r\nallow them to revise entire phases of the judicial cycle, \r\nand generate a number of concrete initiatives to amend, \r\nwhere necessary, the legal framework, practices and \r\nmethods of work. The third and last retreat took place in \r\nKraków, Poland, this year, focusing on appeals issues. \r\nThe two previous retreats, held in 2015 in Nuremberg, \r\nGermany, and in 2016 in Limburg, the Netherlands, had \r\nfocused on pre-trial and trial issues, respectively.\r\nThese collective discussions were unprecedented. \r\nFor the first time at the Court, all judges accepted that \r\njudicial independence within their respective cases and \r\nChambers was in no way incompatible with exchanging \r\nviews and experiences with a view to identifying best \r\npractices and recommending common responses to \r\nsome challenges. These ground-breaking efforts have \r\ngenerated a number of initiatives and produced several \r\nconcrete outcomes.\r\nA publicly available Chambers Practice Manual \r\nseeks to harmonize the approach to certain matters \r\nby clarifying how certain procedural phases should \r\nbe carried out. To the extent possible, judges have \r\nsought to improve the Court’s work through practice \r\nrather than amendments to the legal framework, \r\nwhich should remain exceptional. However, certain \r\nspecific amendments have been introduced to the \r\nRules of Procedure and Evidence and Regulations of \r\nthe Court. We have also improved the structure of the \r\nlegal support staff at the Court. The reforms we have \r\nput in place are already having a visible impact on our \r\ncourtrooms and cases, including a clear and drastic \r\nreduction of the time required for some phases or \r\naspects of proceedings. We have also made progress \r\nin the development of performance indicators, and a \r\nthird report, which will be produced at the end of this \r\nyear, will be accompanied by a fuller set of data, which, \r\nwe hope, will help illustrate the work of the Court \r\nacross cases.\r\nEnhancing the efficiency of the Court has become \r\ncritical at a time in which the Court is very busy at \r\nvarious stages of proceedings and the heavy workload \r\nis likely to continue in future. As I mentioned before, \r\nmuch progress has been achieved in this regard, \r\nalthough, of course, much more is required. The Court \r\nis not perfect, but it is working, it has matured and it is \r\ndelivering on its mandate.\r\nAs part of improving its governance, we have \r\nalso sought to strengthen the safeguards that ensure \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 3/30\r\nthat officials and staff members of the Court uphold \r\nthe highest standards of integrity and professionalism \r\nin the exercise of their functions. I would like to \r\nemphasize in this regard that a system of disclosure \r\nof financial information for certain elected officials \r\nand senior managers has been in place since 2015, that \r\nthe Independent Oversight Mechanism created by the \r\nAssembly of States Parties is now fully operational, and \r\nthat a new policy for the protection of whistle-blowers \r\nis being developed at the Court. Also, in this regard, \r\nwe have started a review of all relevant existing legal \r\nprovisions, including codes of ethics. We consider \r\nit important to assess the adequacy of this legal \r\nframework in order to identify any lacunae, introduce \r\namendments, if necessary, and make recommendations \r\nto the Assembly of States Parties, if appropriate.\r\nAs I indicated, the Court is now confronted with \r\na heavy workload, and that is likely to continue next \r\nyear. At the start of the reporting period, convictions \r\nor sentences were issued in two trials against a total of \r\nsix persons. The first one concerns Mr. Ahmad Al-Faqi \r\nAl-Mahdi for the destruction of world-heritage property \r\nin Timbuktu, Mali. The second one was brought by the \r\nProsecutor against Mr. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo and \r\nfour co-accused for offences against the administration \r\nof justice related to the alleged corruption of witnesses \r\nin the main case against Mr. Bemba. The conviction and \r\nsentences in this second case are now being considered \r\non appeal.\r\nThree trials are currently ongoing before the \r\nChambers of the Court. The most recent of these is \r\nthe trial against Mr. Dominic Ongwen, which started \r\non 6 December 2016. More than 10 years had elapsed \r\nsince the arrest warrants of the Court were issued \r\nagainst him, together with Mr. Joseph Kony and others, \r\nfor alleged crimes against humanity committed by \r\nmembers of the Lord’s Resistance Army in northern \r\nUganda. Mr. Ongwen finally surrendered of his own \r\nfree will and was transferred to the Court on 17 January \r\n2015, thus allowing judicial proceedings to start. The \r\ntrial is now progressing at a high speed. It is a huge \r\ndevelopment that a trial is now finally being conducted \r\nbefore our judges. It also illustrates the enormous \r\nchallenges that the Court needs to confront for its \r\ncases to reach the courtroom. While the Court is doing \r\nits best to accelerate the pace of proceedings, many \r\nof the difficulties are beyond its control and can be \r\novercome only with the cooperation of the international \r\ncommunity. Without an army and without police, the \r\nCourt’s most notable single challenge, among many \r\nothers, remains the arrest of suspects.\r\nAnother illustration of a similar problem is the \r\nongoing trial against Mr. Bosco Ntaganda, who \r\nhas been accused of war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity allegedly committed in the Ituri district of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mr. Ntaganda \r\nwas subject of an arrest warrant for several years, from \r\n2006 until 2013, when he finally also surrendered \r\nvoluntarily and was transferred to the Court. Trial \r\nhearings are expected to finish early next year.\r\nThe third trial in progress is the case of Mr. Laurent \r\nGbagbo and Mr. Charles Blé Goudé, both accused of \r\ncrimes against humanity allegedly committed during \r\npost-election violence in Côte d’Ivoire between \r\nDecember 2010 and April 2011. The Prosecution is \r\ncurrently presenting its evidence, and the trial is \r\nexpected to continue throughout next year.\r\nTrials are the most visible and the most \r\nresource-intensive work at the Court. However, a lot is \r\nalso happening in the Pre-Trial and Appeals Divisions. \r\nSome of it may go unnoticed or, in fact, be under seal, \r\nas shown by the unsealing of the arrest warrant against \r\nMr. Al-Tuhamy Mohamed Khaled earlier this year. He \r\nis suspected of crimes against humanity and war crimes \r\nthat were allegedly committed on Libyan territory from \r\nFebruary to August 2011.\r\nThe work of the Pre-Trial and Trial Divisions also \r\nhas an impact on the workload of the Appeals Division, \r\nwhich is now dealing with interlocutory appeals, \r\nappeals in relation to reparations proceedings, and, \r\nmost notably, appeals against the final conviction and \r\nsentences issued in two cases. One of these is the case \r\nI have already referred to: the case against Mr. Jean-\r\nPierre Bemba Gombo and four others for offences \r\nagainst the administration of the Court. The other \r\nis in the main case against Mr. Bemba for failure to \r\npunish or prevent crimes of rape, murder and pillaging \r\nthat were allegedly committed by his subordinates in \r\nthe Central African Republic in 2002 and 2003. The \r\nAppeals Chamber is expected to issue its judgment in \r\nthose two cases in the first quarter of next year.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAs I have just described, the Court is seized \r\nof a number of cases that are in different stages of \r\njudicial proceedings. The Prosecutor is continuing \r\nher investigative activities with respect to 10 \r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n4/30 17-35155\r\nsituations, as well as preliminary examinations in \r\nrelation to 10 countries on four continents. None \r\nof these activities would be possible without the \r\ncooperation of States — parties and non-parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute — and organizations. I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to acknowledge the excellent \r\ncooperation we receive from a large number of States, \r\nincluding most of the countries in which there are \r\nongoing investigations.\r\nAt the same time, it is of grave concern that several \r\nsuspects remain at large, despite arrest warrants having \r\nbeen issued by the Court. As I have already said, the \r\narrest of suspects remains the main challenge for the \r\nCourt. In total, requests for arrest and transfer issued \r\nby the Court are outstanding against 15 persons, in six \r\ndifferent situations. With regard to our justice efforts, it \r\nis essential that those individuals be brought before the \r\nCourt. I call on all States to contribute to achieving that \r\nend. I also urge the Security Council, which referred the \r\nsituations in Darfur and Libya to the Prosecutor, to take \r\nmeasures to ensure full cooperation with the Court.\r\nThe most recent arrest warrant, now outstanding, \r\nwas issued on 15 August against Mr. Mahmoud Mustafa \r\nBusayf Al-Werfalli in relation to the situation in Libya. \r\nHe is suspected of having committed and ordered \r\nmurder as a war crime in relation to events that took \r\nplace in Benghazi and the surrounding area between \r\nJune 2016 and July 2017.\r\nBringing the alleged perpetrators of the most serious \r\ninternational crimes to justice is the core mandate of \r\nthe International Criminal Court. Indeed, the Court \r\nwas created in the belief that those crimes constitute a \r\nthreat to peace and security. The Court was also created \r\nin the belief that investigating and prosecuting them will \r\nhelp prevent further atrocities, thereby contributing to \r\nsustainable peace. In its work, the Court does not target \r\nStates or regions; rather, it seeks to protect the victims \r\nof such crimes. It is therefore essential to ensure that \r\nvictims understand the work of the Court and have \r\nsufficient ownership of justice efforts.\r\nThe Rome Statute recognizes that point and, for the \r\nfirst time, contains elements intended to give victims a \r\nvoice in all stages of the proceedings, as participants in \r\ntheir own right, and not merely as witnesses of crimes. \r\nThe Rome Statute allows victims to provide information \r\nto the Prosecutor and participate in the judicial \r\nproceedings to express their views and concerns.\r\nVictims are indeed central to our work. As part of \r\nour measures to enhance performance, much has been \r\ndone to improve the way that we communicate and reach \r\nout to victims, so that they have sufficient knowledge \r\nof our work and their rights in our proceedings. \r\nIn the Ongwen case, for example, proceedings are \r\nbroadcast regularly at viewing sessions in the affected \r\ncommunities. In the Central African Republic, the \r\nCourt’s enhanced field-office capacity has made it \r\npossible to extend outreach activities to many locations \r\nbeyond Bangui. In Côte d’Ivoire, radio and television \r\nprogrammes are broadcast on a regular basis.\r\nAlmost 13,000 victims are currently participating \r\nin various International Criminal Court proceedings \r\nthrough legal representatives, including more than 4,000 \r\nvictims in the most recent Ongwen case. The increasing \r\nnumber of victims willing to participate demonstrates \r\nboth the success of the Court in improving the access \r\nof victims to justice and the enormous challenge that \r\nlies ahead. Indeed, the participation of sometimes \r\nthousands of victims raises a number of legal and \r\noperational challenges, as such participation must be \r\ngenuine and meaningful without affecting the right of \r\nthe accused to a fair and expeditious trial.\r\nFurthermore, as victims participate through legal \r\nrepresentation, one particular challenge is to ensure that \r\nlegal counsel properly channel the voices of victims. \r\nChambers have applied different systems to that end, \r\nbut further reflection will be needed in that regard.\r\nReparations for the harm suffered are another \r\ncrucial aspect of the ICC’s focus on victims. As the \r\nGeneral Assembly is aware, the Rome Statute is the \r\nfirst instrument of its kind to provide for the possibility \r\nof ordering reparations to victims in case of conviction. \r\nFollowing the completion of trials, reparations \r\nproceedings are now ongoing in four cases.\r\nLast year, reparations were ordered in the case of \r\nMr. Germain Katanga, who was convicted of crimes \r\ncommitted during the attack on the village of Bogoro, \r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Trial \r\nChamber awarded both individual and collective \r\nreparations to the victims of the crimes of which \r\nMr. Katanga was convicted. The Chamber set the \r\namount of his liability at $1 million. The reparations \r\norder in that case has been appealed.\r\nMost recently, collective and individual reparations, \r\nas well as some symbolic measures, were ordered in \r\nthe case of Mr. Al-Mahdi, related to the destruction of \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 5/30\r\nreligious and historic buildings in Timbuktu, Mali. The \r\nLegal Representative of Victims has filed an appeal \r\nagainst the reparations order.\r\nAs part of the reparations system, States parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute established a Trust Fund for Victims, \r\nfunded by voluntary donations from States and other \r\ndonors. The Trust Fund can contribute financially to \r\nimplementing reparations orders in cases in which \r\nthe convicted party is indigent, but it can also provide \r\nbroader assistance to victims who suffered damages \r\nresulting from crimes within the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt extending beyond the confines of specific cases. \r\nIn northern Uganda, for example, the Trust Fund \r\nhas been active for 10 years in working with local \r\nnon-governmental organizations on projects aimed \r\nat mentally and physically rehabilitating victims. I \r\nhad the opportunity to personally visit some of those \r\nprojects earlier this year, and noted first hand in my \r\ndiscussions with victims who are benefiting from these \r\nprogrammes the importance of the assistance that the \r\nFund is providing them.\r\nReparations and assistance depend on voluntary \r\ncontributions to the Fund. I stress the importance \r\nof those contributions to ensuring the success of the \r\nsystem and take this opportunity to thank all States that \r\nhave already donated to the Fund, in particular for the \r\ndonations made this year.\r\nAs I have already underscored, the Court is \r\nconfronting many challenges and difficulties that can \r\nbe overcome only with the full cooperation of States, \r\norganizations and civil society. Although the Court is \r\nnot part of the United Nations, it shares its goals and \r\nvalues. It must frequently intervene in situations that are \r\nalso of concern to the Organization. As the Assembly is \r\naware, the ICC and the United Nations are also formally \r\nlinked through the Relationship Agreement. Continued \r\ncooperation of the United Nations is crucial for the \r\nwork of the International Criminal Court.\r\nI wish to express my gratitude to Secretary-\r\nGeneral António Guterres and his predecessor, Mr \r\nBan Ki-moon, for supporting the ICC. The Court \r\nalso greatly appreciates the excellent relations that it \r\nenjoys with the Legal Counsel and other high-level \r\nofficials of the United Nations, as well as with a \r\nnumber of the Organization’s programmes, funds and \r\nspecialized agencies.\r\nUnited Nations cooperation with the Court takes \r\nseveral forms. It includes logistical and security \r\nassistance in the field, as well as judicial assistance, \r\nsuch as the disclosure of documents and making United \r\nNations staff available as providers of information and \r\nwitnesses. All those various forms of cooperation, \r\nwhich are provided on a cost-reimbursement basis, are \r\nhighly valuable to the Court.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nOver the past 30 years, the concept of accountability \r\nhas figured prominently on the global agenda. It is \r\nnow widely accepted that there is an obligation to end \r\nimpunity for the most serious crimes of concern to \r\nthe international community: genocide, war crimes, \r\nand crimes against humanity. The emergence of \r\nthis principle as a norm under international law has \r\nchanged the parameters for the pursuit of peace. There \r\nis now an expectation that there will be accountability \r\nfor the most serious crimes, and the conviction that \r\naccountability is necessary for achieving sustainable \r\npeace. The question is no longer whether to pursue \r\njustice, but rather when and how.\r\nThe International Criminal Court is playing \r\na central role in the international criminal-justice \r\nsystem, and it is making important contributions to \r\nensuring accountability for the gravest international \r\ncrimes. However, despite all the progress, there are still \r\nhuge gaps where impunity continues to f lourish. These \r\ngaps can be addressed only through the joint justice \r\nefforts of international, regional and national systems. \r\nNo single jurisdiction alone can deal with this type of \r\ncrimes, which involve multiple perpetrators, as well as \r\nthousands or even hundreds of thousands of victims. It \r\nis essential to emphasize in particular that each State \r\nhas the primary responsibility to prevent, investigate \r\nand prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and \r\nwar crimes. International and regional jurisdictions \r\ncan only supplement, but never replace, the actions \r\nof States.\r\nThe International Criminal Court was explicitly \r\nestablished as a complementary mechanism of last \r\nresort intended to address only situations in which \r\nthe relevant States fail to act. As a positive result of \r\nthis complementary system, an increasing number of \r\nStates have updated their national legislation to be able \r\nto investigate and prosecute international crimes at the \r\ndomestic level. Others have also established specialized \r\nunits within their justice systems in order to deal with \r\nthese types of crimes.\r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n6/30 17-35155\r\nAll such initiatives are commendable and necessary \r\nif we are to establish an effective system of global \r\njustice. That is why it is also important to deploy every \r\neffort to enhance national capacity to investigate and \r\nprosecute mass crimes. Although capacity-building as \r\nsuch is not the task of the ICC, we can assist in reflecting \r\nupon the way forward and make our expertise available \r\nwhere necessary. Just last week, the Court convened a \r\nregional seminar in the Niger, with particular emphasis \r\non complementarity.\r\nIt is also important to deploy efforts to enhance \r\nmembership in the ICC system. To this effect, we \r\ncooperate closely with other actors promoting the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute, such as States parties \r\nto the Statute, international and regional organizations, \r\nand civil society. Promoting the universal participation \r\nin the Rome Statute is of fundamental importance so \r\nas to enhance the effectiveness and the legitimacy of \r\nthe institution and its capacity to contribute to the rule \r\nof law, justice, and sustainable peace and development.\r\nWe have undertaken a number of initiatives this \r\nyear that foster both cooperation with the Court and \r\nthe universality of the Rome Statute. I would like to \r\nmention in particular two important seminars that took \r\nplace this year: one in Trinidad and Tobago, and the \r\nother in the Republic of Korea. The Court is grateful \r\nto the European Commission and all others that have \r\nfinancially supported these and other events organized \r\nby the Court aimed at advancing dialogue with States \r\nand other key partners. I would also like to especially \r\nthank all the States that agreed to host meetings of \r\nthe Court for their hospitality.\r\nLast month, I had the privilege of attending the \r\nPacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Meeting in Samoa, \r\nwhere we held an ICC workshop and engaged in \r\nconstructive discussions with many of the leaders \r\npresent. There was broad recognition of the importance \r\nof the ICC and the rule of law for the protection of small \r\nand medium-sized countries in particular. I am deeply \r\ngrateful to the Government of Samoa and the secretariat \r\nof the Forum for facilitating my participation in this \r\nmeeting. It was a unique opportunity to reach out to \r\nHeads of State and Government from the region and \r\nencourage greater participation of Pacific Island States \r\nin the ICC.\r\nThe quest for accountability is a work in progress. \r\nThere is much to celebrate, but more concerted efforts \r\nare required to investigate and prosecute international \r\ncrimes at all levels. To achieve effective deterrence, \r\nwe must create a consistent pattern of accountability. \r\nDespite the historic achievements in the fight against \r\nimpunity, we are not there yet. We also need concerted \r\nefforts to improve the quality of international criminal \r\njustice. As I have explained, the ICC has achieved \r\nconcrete results in improving its efficiency, but more \r\nwork is needed in this regard too, and it should not be \r\ndone in isolation.\r\nThe International Criminal Court was created \r\nin the belief that an international system cannot be \r\nassociated with a particular legal system or set of \r\nvalues. A truly international system incorporates \r\nelements of legal systems and traditions from around \r\nthe world and represents values that resonate across the \r\nglobe. This premise continues to be valid today. There \r\nis no particular legal system that is per se more apt for \r\ninvestigating and prosecuting this type of crime. We \r\nmust strive to identify the best tools of each system \r\nin order to improve the quality of our work. We did it \r\ntogether at the ICC among all the judges, and we are now \r\nextending the dialogue to other courts and tribunals.\r\nA step forward was taken two weeks ago, in Paris, \r\nwhere a meeting of presidents and judges from several \r\ninternational criminal tribunals and mechanisms was \r\nheld for the first time. As practitioners experience \r\nsimilar challenges, there is a need for them to engage \r\nin a dialogue on how best to solve them. I thank l’École \r\nnationale de la magistrature — the French National \r\nSchool for the Judiciary — for hosting this extremely \r\nimportant and unprecedented event.\r\nIndeed, we must take stock of the \r\nachievements — and mistakes — of the past three \r\ndecades in order to identify together the best tools for \r\nan effective system of international criminal justice for \r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of \r\nMexico to introduce draft resolution A/72/L.3.\r\nMr. Sandoval Mendiolea (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I have the honour of introducing the draft \r\nresolution contained in document A/72/L.3, entitled \r\n“Report of the International Criminal Court”. The draft \r\nresolution welcomes the report of the International \r\nCriminal Court on its activities during the period 2016-\r\n2017 (see A/72/349) and is an update of resolution \r\n71/253, adopted on 23 December 2016. My delegation \r\nwould also like to express its gratitude to all the \r\ndelegations that have sponsored the draft, which once \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 7/30\r\nagain reaffirms the importance that members attribute \r\nto the annual report on the work of the International \r\nCriminal Court. I would greatly appreciate submitting \r\nthe draft resolution contained in document A/72/L.3 to \r\nthe General Assembly for adoption without a vote.\r\nI would now like to make some brief comments \r\nin my national capacity. Mexico would like to thank \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court, \r\nJudge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, for her excellent \r\npresentation of the report of the activities of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court to the General Assembly, \r\nwhich we have just heard. We are also grateful for and \r\nwish to pay tribute to the excellent leadership exercised \r\nby the President during her term of office, which is \r\nabout to end.\r\nOver this period, significant progress has been \r\nmade by the Court. It was a year of firsts: the Court \r\ndealt with its first trial on the destruction of cultural \r\nassets as a war crime in the trial against Mr. Al-Mahdi, \r\nin the context of the situation in Mali. Again, this was \r\nthe first case of the Court where the accused admitted \r\nhis guilt. The Court also handed down its first sentence \r\nfor crimes against the administration of justice in the \r\nBemba et al. case, condemning the defence and the \r\naccused for exerting undue influence on witnesses and \r\nhaving borne false witness to the Court in the situation \r\nof the Central African Republic. In this period, the first \r\ntrial resulting from the situation in Uganda took place. \r\nThese are significant contributions in the development \r\nof contemporary international criminal justice, both \r\nsubstantive and procedural.\r\nWe congratulate the Court for including specific \r\nproposals in its report to strengthen the international \r\ncriminal-justice system, an objective acknowledged in \r\nthe Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations. In \r\nparticular, we highlight the following points. First, we \r\nagree on the need for increased cooperation between \r\nthe Security Council and the Court. Mexico promotes \r\nthe responsible and objective use of the Council’s power \r\nto refer situations to the Court. That is why Mexico, \r\ntogether with France, supports the initiative in which \r\nthe permanent members of the Security Council would \r\nrefrain from using the veto in mass atrocity situations. \r\nWe urge all those States that have not yet done so to \r\njoin us in taking this initiative in order to strengthen \r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nSecondly, believing that the major challenges \r\nfor cooperation with the Court arise specifically \r\nin situations referred by the Council, we regret the \r\nCouncil’s failure to act and agree that it is essential for \r\nit to follow up on these referred situations in order to \r\nfoster cooperation on the part of both States parties and \r\nStates non-parties to the Statute of the Court.\r\nThirdly, we agree that the mutual exchange between \r\nboth organs would, as is suggested in the report, \r\nbenefit from a structured dialogue which would make \r\nit possible to discuss not just the situations referred by \r\nthe Council, but also other situations that the Court is \r\nlooking at and thematic issues of mutual interest.\r\nFourthly, we also support exploring ways to \r\nachieve closer cooperation between the Security \r\nCouncil sanctions committees and the International \r\nCriminal Court, considering the usefulness of travel \r\nbans and asset freezes ordered by the Council for the \r\ndetention of persons accused by the Court, as well as \r\nfor the confiscation of their assets in order to provide \r\nreparations to victims.\r\nMexico wishes to underscore the identification by \r\nthe Court in its report of the use of the platform provided \r\nby the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nparticularly with regard to Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 16, in order to include issues related to the Rome \r\nStatute in legal and judicial reform programmes with \r\nthe support of the United Nations.\r\nMexico welcomes this approach. Indeed, the report \r\nissued this year by the Secretary-General promoting the \r\nrule of law in the Organization’s activities (A/72/268) \r\ndescribes significant activities involving assistance \r\nprovided by the United Nations to countries throughout \r\nthe world to strengthen their justice and security \r\ninstitutions, including the development of national \r\ncapacities for the investigation and prosecution of \r\ninternational crimes, which is consistent with States’ \r\nprimary responsibility in this regard. These endeavours \r\ncarried out by the United Nations and those deployed \r\nfor human rights or development are appropriate for the \r\nprovision of technical assistance. We are pleased that \r\nthe Court recognizes this fact in its report, and we hope \r\nthat it will be implemented comprehensively across the \r\nInternational Criminal Court system.\r\nFinally, Mexico supports the swift activation of \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. \r\nThis will round out the functional forms of jurisdiction \r\nprovided for under the Rome Statute in 1998. A few \r\nmonths before the twentieth anniversary of the Statute \r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n8/30 17-35155\r\nand the fifteenth anniversary of the Court’s becoming \r\nactive, we believe that it is high time for this to be done.\r\nMexico reiterates its commitment to the \r\ninternational criminal justice and to strengthening the \r\nsystem that was created by the Rome Statute, in order \r\nto avoid impunity for the perpetrators of the most \r\nserious crimes that affect the international community \r\nas a whole.\r\nMr. Jensen (Denmark): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the five Nordic countries: Finland, Iceland, \r\nNorway, Sweden and my own country, Denmark.\r\nI would like to start by thanking the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) for its annual report to the United \r\nNations (see A/72/349). I would also like to thank Judge \r\nFernández de Gurmendi, President of the ICC, for her \r\nthorough presentation of the main issues of the report. \r\nAgain, the yearly report bears witness to the Court’s \r\nincreasing activity across a broad range of situations and \r\ncases, showing that the ICC is truly a global criminal \r\ncourt. The Nordic countries would like to express our \r\nsincere appreciation to the Court for its significant \r\ncontribution in the fight against impunity worldwide.\r\nHolding to account perpetrators and ensuring justice \r\nfor victims of the most serious crimes of concern to the \r\ninternational community as a whole are principles shared \r\nby States in all parts of the world. The International \r\nCriminal Court is an essential institution, not only for \r\npromoting respect for international humanitarian law \r\nand human rights law, but also for the advancement of \r\npost-conflict peacebuilding and reconciliation, with a \r\nview to achieving sustainable development and peace, \r\nas also envisioned in Sustainable Development Goal 16 \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nThe success of the ICC depends on cooperation with \r\nother stakeholders, and many States and international \r\norganizations provide important contributions to the \r\nCourt. However, it is a continued cause for concern \r\nthat the number of outstanding arrest warrants remains \r\nhigh. We strongly urge all States to cooperate fully \r\nand effectively with the Court, in line with applicable \r\nSecurity Council resolutions. Furthermore, States \r\nparties to the Rome Statute have undertaken an \r\nobligation to this end.\r\nThe Court’s promise of justice for victims \r\ncorresponds to the reach of its jurisdiction, which, first \r\nand foremost, depends on how universally the Rome \r\nStatute has been ratified. The ICC needs more States \r\nparties, not fewer. We would therefore like to welcome \r\nEl Salvador as the latest State party to the Rome \r\nStatute. Furthermore, the Nordic countries are pleased \r\nto note that the Gambia and South Africa reversed \r\ntheir previous decisions, having withdrawn their \r\nnotifications of withdrawal before they took effect.\r\nHowever, we also wish to reiterate our deep \r\ndisappointment and concern with respect to the decision \r\nof the Government of Burundi to withdraw from \r\nthe Rome Statute. We stand ready for a constructive \r\ndiscussion about concerns that some States parties \r\nmay have and encourage and invite States parties that \r\nare critical of the Court to seek solutions within the \r\nframework and fundamental principles of the Rome \r\nStatute. Continued dialogue is of key importance.\r\nAs the ICC is a court of last resort, States \r\nhave the primary responsibility to investigate and \r\nprosecute crimes. However, States affected by \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes \r\nmight at times need capacity support to implement \r\nthe  relevant legislation, initiate investigations and \r\nconduct criminal proceedings. The Nordic countries \r\nemphasize the value of States parties assisting one \r\nanother — and those States that are interested in \r\nratifying the Statute — in developing capacity. We are \r\ncommitted to strong international cooperation. Such \r\ncooperation can strengthen the political commitment of \r\nStates to conducting genuine and fair proceedings in \r\nwhat are often challenging circumstances.\r\nCooperation that engages international, regional \r\nand national actors in the justice sector, as well as civil \r\nsociety, also furthers the principle of complementarity. \r\nIn this context, we wish to highlight the complementarity \r\nprogramme of the Justice Rapid Response facility, which \r\noffers assistance and mentoring to States that are willing \r\nto investigate conflict-related international crimes.\r\nIn this forum, I would like to make particular note \r\nof the ongoing cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the ICC as described in the report. We share the \r\nCourt’s strong appreciation for the crucial support \r\nand cooperation from senior leadership of the United \r\nNations, particularly the role played by former and \r\npresent Secretaries-General, as well as the engagement \r\nof the relevant United Nations departments, among \r\nwhich the Office of the Legal Counsel should be \r\nhighlighted. We welcome the ongoing high-level \r\nconsultations between the principals of the Court and \r\nsenior United Nations officials. This dialogue also \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 9/30\r\nsets the course for more concrete areas of cooperation, \r\nincluding stronger cooperation in the field and \r\nsupportive policy statements from relevant United \r\nNations bodies.\r\nEnhanced cooperation between the Court and the \r\nSecurity Council is still necessary. This is particularly \r\ntrue in cases of non-cooperation with the ICC, as well \r\nas for strengthened follow-up on situations referred to \r\nthe Court by the Security Council. We also note with \r\ngreat concern that the Security Council has been unable \r\nto refer the Syrian situation to the ICC, and we strongly \r\nurge Council members to continue efforts in that regard.\r\nThe Nordic countries are appalled by the continued, \r\nblatant disregard for human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law in Syria. Without stronger and more \r\ncommitted action by the Council and States parties, the \r\nsituation will not improve. All of those responsible for \r\nwar crimes and other serious international crimes must \r\nbe held accountable. Impunity is not an option. In this \r\nregard, the Nordic countries are proud to support the \r\nwork of the International, Impartial and Independent \r\nMechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution \r\nof Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes \r\nunder International Law Committed in the Syrian \r\nArab Republic since March 2011, with the important \r\nmandate to collect, save and categorize evidence for \r\nfuture investigations and trials. We encourage others \r\nto do the same. Furthermore, our strong support for the \r\nIndependent International Commission of Inquiry on \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic remains.\r\nThe full realization of the rights of victims is \r\nan important aspect of the continuing success and \r\nrelevance of the Court. We commend the important \r\nwork of the ICC Trust Fund for Victims, which has \r\nsupported more than 450,000 victims in northern \r\nUganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nand has recently launched an assistance programme in \r\nCôte d’Ivoire. We encourage States and other entities to \r\ncontribute to the Trust Fund.\r\nThe Nordic countries also welcome the Court’s \r\nambitions to further enhance the efficiency of its \r\nactivities. We especially welcome the Prosecutor’s \r\npolicies to address crimes against those most vulnerable \r\nin important areas, such as sexual and gender-based \r\ncrimes and crimes against children.\r\nIn order for the Court to be able to carry out its \r\nmission in the most efficient way, it also needs to be \r\nproperly funded. The Court’s budget will be dealt with \r\nin the Assembly of States Parties later this year, but we \r\nwish to underline the worldwide activities of the Court, \r\nas reflected in the Court’s report. It is our common \r\nresponsibility to ensure that the Court has sufficient \r\nresources to carry out its important mandate in a time \r\nof increasing demand.\r\nMr. Barros Melet (Chile), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nLikewise, it is the obligation of the Court to ensure \r\nits effective and efficient functioning, and we commend \r\nthe steps taken in this regard, as well as in terms of \r\ndeveloping performance indicators. We also stress the \r\nimportance of upholding and strengthening governance \r\nstandards and ensuring proper investigation of alleged \r\nmisconduct. In this context, we particularly note the \r\nneed to address recent allegations and ensure that the \r\nimpartiality and independence of the Court remains \r\nbeyond doubt.\r\nI would like to conclude by renewing our pledge that \r\nthe Nordic countries will remain staunch supporters of \r\nthe ICC. We are committed to continuing to work for \r\nthe Court’s effectiveness, independence and integrity.\r\nMs. Beckles (Trinidad and Tobago): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the 14 States members of \r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM).\r\nWe are grateful to the Secretary-General for the \r\nannual report of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) (see A/72/349) and supporting documents, which \r\nprovide useful information on the activities of the Court \r\nin the 2016-2017 period.\r\nCARICOM’S unwavering commitment to the ICC is \r\ninformed by its recognition of the importance of ending \r\nimpunity for perpetrators of the most serious crimes \r\nof concern to the international community, namely, \r\nthe crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, \r\nwar crimes and crimes of aggression, as outlined in \r\narticle 5 of the Rome Statute. We therefore join with \r\nother members of the international community in \r\nunderscoring the importance of preventing such crimes \r\nand ensuring that those responsible for perpetrating \r\nthem are brought to justice. It is noteworthy to mention \r\nthat, from our region, the late Arthur N. R. Robinson, \r\nformer President and Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Trinidad and Tobago, has been credited as one of \r\nthe forefathers of the ICC through his pioneering work \r\nwhich led to the establishment of the Court.\r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n10/30 17-35155\r\nIn the light of the concerns of some over the \r\ncriminal jurisdiction of the ICC as a threat to national \r\nsovereignty, we wish to recall that, consistent with the \r\nprinciple of complementarity enshrined in the Rome \r\nStatute, the Court’s jurisdiction is invoked only when \r\nStates refuse to prosecute those alleged to be guilty of \r\ncommitting grave crimes of concern to the international \r\ncommunity or where they lack the appropriate domestic \r\njurisdiction to do so. No individual or State should fear \r\nthe ICC, as it is a court of last resort.\r\nNotwithstanding its many challenges, we cannot \r\nignore the fact that the ICC continues to be a beacon of \r\nhope for victims of crimes within its jurisdiction who \r\nare seeking justice. These include thousands of women \r\nand children, who are often the ones most affected by \r\nthe actions of criminals who show blatant disregard for \r\nthe sanctity of human life by violating international \r\nhumanitarian law and international human rights.\r\nAs stated in the report of the ICC, we are pleased \r\nto note that, to date, the Trust Fund for Victims and \r\nimplementing partners have assisted more than \r\n455,000 victims, including through providing physical \r\nand psychological rehabilitation, as well as material \r\nsupport to survivors of Rome Statute crimes. We also \r\nurge States and other entities in a position to do so to \r\ncontribute to the Trust Fund, with a view to providing \r\nfor the expansion and sustenance of its assistance \r\nprogrammes as well as for Court-ordered reparations.\r\nCARICOM asserts that the success of the Court \r\nis intrinsically linked to the universality of the Rome \r\nStatute. Therefore, we are convinced that through \r\nincreased cooperation, the Court would be better \r\nable to effectively discharge the mandate entrusted \r\nto it by States parties. In this regard, we reiterate our \r\ncommitment to promoting the universality of the Rome \r\nStatute of the ICC and urge all States that have not \r\nyet done so to take the necessary steps to ratify and \r\nfully implement the Statute with a view to promoting \r\nits universality.\r\nCARICOM recalls the decision made at the Review \r\nConference of the Rome Statute held in 2010 in Kampala, \r\nUganda, for the Court to exercise its jurisdiction over \r\nthe crime of aggression once 30 States had ratified the \r\namendments proposed there and subject to a decision of \r\nthe Assembly to activate that jurisdiction. We therefore \r\nlook forward to the upcoming decision of the Assembly \r\nto activate the Court’s jurisdiction over the crime of \r\naggression later this year, with a view to ensuring that \r\nthe Court is able to exercise wider jurisdiction, including \r\nover crimes of aggression, thereby preventing impunity.\r\nCARICOM recognizes that during the current \r\nreporting period, three States parties acceded to the \r\nAgreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the ICC, \r\nbringing the total number of parties to the Agreement to \r\n77. Further, four States parties have ratified or accepted \r\narticle 8 and the crime of aggression amendments to the \r\nStatute, bringing the total number of States parties to \r\nboth amendments to 34. In addition, four States have \r\nacceded to the article 124 amendment, bringing the \r\ntotal number to five.\r\nCARICOM recognizes the importance of \r\ncooperation with the United Nations to the proper \r\nfunctioning of the Court. We are therefore pleased to \r\nnote that during the current reporting period, the Court \r\ncontinued to receive crucial support and cooperation \r\nfrom senior United Nations officials, including the \r\ncurrent Secretary-General. We also commend the \r\nUnited Nations on its efforts to provide staff for \r\ninterviews and testimony.\r\nAs part of larger efforts to further advance \r\ncooperation with the Court, we are particularly pleased \r\nto recall that, on 10 and 11 January 2017, in Trinidad \r\nand Tobago, the ICC organized a high-level seminar \r\nfor CARICOM on fostering cooperation with the \r\nCourt. CARICOM commends the ICC for its efforts \r\nin this regard and reiterates its firm commitment to \r\ncooperating with the Court and upholding its mandate.\r\nPursuant to the provisions of the Relationship \r\nAgreement, which provides for the close cooperation \r\nbetween the Court and the United Nations in discharging \r\ntheir respective responsibilities, CARICOM is \r\nsatisfied that in the period from July 2016 to June \r\n2017, the United Nations cooperated extensively with \r\nthe Court, with a view to further strengthening their \r\nrelationship and ensuring the effective implementation \r\nof the Agreement.\r\nIn accordance with the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on this agenda item, we wish to recall that the \r\ncapacity of the Security Council to refer a situation to \r\nthe Court is crucial to promoting accountability, but \r\nactive follow-up on referrals to ensure cooperation, \r\nnamely, the arrest and surrender of individuals, is \r\nnecessary to guarantee that justice is delivered. We \r\nnote with deep concern that the Security Council has \r\nfailed to respond to several notifications of findings of \r\nnon-cooperation in any substantive form.\r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 11/30\r\nCARICOM is also disturbed by the failure of some \r\nStates to honour their legally binding obligations to \r\ncooperate with the Court in the execution of outstanding \r\narrest warrants. Those that fail to cooperate with the \r\nCourt to bring criminals to justice are contributing \r\nto a culture of impunity that not only undermines the \r\nrule of law but also serves as an affront to victims of \r\ngrave crimes.\r\nCARICOM commends the efforts of the Court to \r\nensure that justice prevails and that criminals are not \r\nallowed to continue their actions with impunity. We \r\nremain satisfied with the steadfast commitment and \r\nhard work of the ICC Prosecutor, Ms. Fatou Bensouda, \r\nwho continues to discharge her mandate in a manner \r\nconsistent with the provisions of the Rome Statute of \r\nthe ICC. We take note of the newly opened preliminary \r\nexamination during the current reporting period, as \r\nwell as the ongoing examinations being conducted.\r\nCARICOM once again expresses its concern over \r\nthe increasingly heavy workload of the Court. Pursuant \r\nto the report of the ICC, we note that the Prosecutor \r\nis engaged in ongoing investigations in relation to ten \r\nsituations. Two judgments have been issued, in which \r\nsix accused were convicted and sentenced, three trials \r\nare ongoing and two cases are on appeal. Further, \r\nproceedings relating to reparations in four cases are \r\nunder way. To this end, we reiterate our call for the ICC \r\nto be provided with the resources necessary to properly \r\ndischarge its mandate and ensure that the perpetrators of \r\nthe most serious crimes of concern to the international \r\ncommunity are brought to justice. CARICOM also \r\nurges the States parties that have not yet done so to \r\npay their outstanding contributions so as to ensure that \r\nthe Court is able to discharge its responsibilities in an \r\neffective and efficient manner.\r\nPursuant to article 115 (b) of the Rome Statute \r\nof the ICC and the Relationship Agreement between \r\nthe United Nations and the ICC, CARICOM recalls \r\nthat the expenses associated with referrals by the \r\nSecurity Council should be provided by funds from the \r\nUnited Nations. To this end, we once again reiterate our \r\ncall for the United Nations to honour its obligations to \r\nmeet the costs associated with referrals by the Security \r\nCouncil to the ICC.\r\nIn closing, I would like to reaffirm the unwavering \r\nsupport of CARICOM for upholding the mandate of the \r\nRome Statute of the ICC and for cooperating with the \r\nCourt with a view to putting an end to impunity for \r\nthe perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern \r\nto the international community and ensuring that \r\nadequate reparations are provided to victims.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Chaboureau (European Union) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I have the honour of speaking on behalf on \r\nthe European Union (EU) and its member States. The \r\ncandidate countries the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Montenegro, Serbia; Albania, country of \r\nthe Stabilization and Association Process; and potential \r\ncandidate Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Ukraine, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova and Georgia align themselves \r\nwith this statement.\r\nWe would like to thank President Fernández de \r\nGurmendi for her comprehensive briefing. We also \r\nthank the International Criminal Court (ICC) for its \r\nannual report to the General Assembly (see A/71/349), \r\ncovering the period from 1 August 2016 to 31 July \r\n2017 and detailing a particularly busy year for the \r\nInternational Criminal Court.\r\nThe European Union and its member States consider \r\nthe fight against impunity for the most serious crimes, \r\nby holding the perpetrators accountable for their actions \r\nand ensuring justice for the victims, to be the key to a \r\njust and fair society. We are strong supporters of the \r\nCourt, which, as a crucial institution for the promotion \r\nof a rules-based world order, aims to deliver justice to \r\nthe victims of the most serious crimes when that is not \r\npossible at the national level. The Court remains an \r\nessential custodian of international humanitarian law \r\nand human rights in all countries and is a source of \r\nhope for the millions of victims of atrocities committed \r\naround the world.\r\nComplementarity is at the heart of the system that \r\nwas created by the Rome Statute. The responsibility for \r\nbringing offenders to justice lies with Member States \r\nthemselves. In this regard, for the system to work, all \r\nStates parties must adopt effective national laws so \r\nas to implement the Rome Statute. Through various \r\nassistance instruments and projects, the European \r\nUnion remains committed to supporting initiatives \r\naimed at encouraging Member States to cooperate in \r\nthe fight against impunity, including by improving \r\nways to provide mutual legal assistance.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nwelcome the decisions taken by South Africa and the \r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n12/30 17-35155\r\nGambia to reverse their prior decisions to withdraw \r\nfrom the Rome Statute. We regret that Burundi has \r\nnot reconsidered its decision to withdraw. We invite \r\nStates to contribute to the efforts to combat impunity \r\nfor major international crimes, in accordance with \r\nthe objectives and principles of the Rome Statute and \r\nthe primary responsibility of Member States to bring \r\noffenders to justice. We believe that it is important to \r\nwork constructively on the perception that people might \r\nhave of the Court.\r\nWe also note that, during the reporting period, \r\nthree States acceded to the Agreement on the Privileges \r\nand Immunities of the International Criminal Court, \r\nand four States parties have ratified or accepted the \r\namendments to the Rome Statute, in particular article 8 \r\nthereof, which pertains to the crime of aggression. That \r\nbrings the total number of parties that have accepted \r\nthose amendments to 34.\r\nWe also note that the threshold of 30 ratifications of \r\nthe amendments on the crime of aggression, as provided \r\nfor in resolution RC/Res.6 of the Review Conference on \r\nthe Rome Statute, adopted on 11 June 2010, has been \r\nmet. We note the ongoing discussions on the Court’s \r\njurisdiction over the crime of aggression prior to the \r\nAssembly of the States Parties to the Rome Statute, to \r\nbe held in December. We also welcome the fact that \r\nfour Member States have acceded to the amendments \r\nto article 124.\r\nWith 10 cases under investigation by the Prosecutor, \r\n10 preliminary inquiries, three ongoing trials and two \r\nappeals, the ICC is conducting investigations and trials \r\nthat touch upon most parts of the world, whether it \r\nbe Latin America, Asia, Africa or Europe. While the \r\neffective management of the heavy workload of the ICC \r\nis acknowledged to be a real challenge, the increase in \r\nthe number of cases referred to the ICC reflects the fact \r\nthat many Member States place their hopes in the Court \r\nto bring about justice and accountability.\r\nWe are aware of the important legal developments \r\nthat the ICC, in fulfilling its mandate during the \r\nreporting period, initiated, in particular opening a \r\npreliminary inquiry into the situation in Gabon and \r\ncommencing the trial of Dominic Ongwen with regard \r\nto the situation in Uganda. We take note of the Court’s \r\njudgments during a reporting period in which six \r\ndefendants were convicted and sentenced. The judgment \r\nof the Court with regard to the situation in Mali is the \r\nfirst case on the destruction of cultural property, as \r\nwell as the first case in which an accused has pleaded \r\nguilty, and its judgment on the situation in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic relates, for the first time, to charges \r\nof offences against the administration of justice.\r\nWithin the context of the ICC’s increasing activity, \r\nit is essential that the Court operate in an efficient \r\nand effective manner. We therefore warmly welcome \r\nthe efforts of the Court to implement reforms aimed \r\nat improving the efficiency and performance of \r\nits activities at all stages of the judicial process, \r\nas well as efforts aimed at improving governance \r\nand transparency.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nwelcome the actions undertaken by Member States, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society to assist \r\nand bolster cooperation with the Court. Furthermore, \r\nwe appeal to all States to support and facilitate the work \r\nof the Court throughout its judicial proceedings. We \r\nalso welcome the many forms of fruitful cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Court.\r\nThe recent report of the Court describes its efforts \r\nto fulfil its mandate and the many positive developments \r\nthat are taking place as well as the challenges it faces. \r\nAn ongoing fundamental challenge is the need to \r\nensure cooperation with the Court. Cooperation with \r\nthe Court and the enforcement of its decisions are \r\nindeed essential for the Court to be able to carry out its \r\nmandate. This applies not only to all States parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute, but also when the Security Council \r\nhas referred a situation to the Court, in accordance \r\nwith the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe European Union and its member States fully \r\nagree with the Court that the Security Council’s \r\nprerogative to refer a situation to the Court can help \r\nto promote accountability in countries where serious \r\ncrimes may have been committed, but where the Court \r\nwould have no jurisdiction to act without action from \r\nthe Security Council. We note with concern cases of \r\nnon-cooperation, including in situations referred to the \r\nCourt by the Security Council. We invite the Council \r\nto find ways to improve the implementation of the \r\nobligations created by these referrals, particularly with \r\nrespect to the situations in Darfur and in Libya.\r\nNon-cooperation with the Court hampers its ability \r\nto deliver justice. We urge all Member States to take \r\ncoherent and decisive measures to encourage full and \r\nappropriate cooperation with the Court, including \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 13/30\r\nthrough the prompt implementation of arrest warrants. \r\nWe note with concern that arrest warrants for 15 \r\nindividuals remain outstanding. We also reiterate the \r\nimportance of States refraining from harbouring or \r\nhiding the perpetrators of the most serious crimes, and \r\nof their taking the steps necessary to bring perpetrators \r\nto justice so as to put an end to impunity. Aware of the \r\nimportance of cooperation in the fight against impunity, \r\nwe welcome the 20 October Paris seminar on financial \r\ncooperation with the Court, which was organized by \r\nthe French and Senegalese Ambassadors to The Hague.\r\nIt is important to persevere in the efforts deployed \r\nto reduce the difficulties facing the Court. At the same \r\ntime, it is also important to recognize and welcome the \r\nvery positive aspects of the work that the Court has \r\naccomplished. In particular, with regard to victims, \r\nthe European Union, a strong supporter of the Court, \r\nwishes to highlight the Court’s activities on their \r\nbehalf, in particular the fact that 2,089 victims have \r\nbeen allowed to participate in Court proceedings. In \r\naddition, the Court received 13 new applications for \r\nvictims’ participation in proceedings, 2,207 requests for \r\nreparations and 2,505 claims covering both reparations \r\nand participation in proceedings.\r\nWe especially welcome the strengthening of the \r\nICC Trust Fund for Victims, which is a key pillar of the \r\nwork of the ICC, and we express the full support of the \r\nEuropean Union to the Fund, which contributes to the \r\nachievement of an inclusive and lasting peace by helping \r\nthe victims who are beneficiaries of the Fund to return \r\nto a dignified and fruitful life in their communities.\r\nWe particularly welcome the assistance projects \r\naimed at providing support to survivors of crimes \r\nunder the Rome Statute in northern Uganda and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, as well as the \r\nlaunch of an assistance programme for victims in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire.\r\nThe universality of the Rome Statute is essential \r\nto ensure accountability for the most serious crimes \r\naffecting the entire international community. Today, \r\nmore than ever, the world needs the ICC, and the ICC \r\nneeds the support of all countries. That is why we call \r\non all States Members of the United Nations that have \r\nnot yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to the \r\nRome Statute, thus demonstrating their commitment to \r\nthe fight against impunity, the prevention of atrocities \r\nand the strengthening of international law and the rule \r\nof law. During the reporting period, the European \r\nUnion continued its efforts aimed at promoting the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute and the Agreement \r\non the Privileges and Immunities and at improving \r\nunderstanding of the mandate of the Court.\r\nNext year’s twentieth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Rome Statute will be a good opportunity to \r\nurge the international community to engage in a more \r\nconcerted collective effort in support of the Court. The \r\nEuropean Union and its member States are committed \r\nto continuing to work with all partners to further \r\nstrengthen the International Criminal Court and, more \r\ngenerally, international criminal justice.\r\nMr. Tenya Hasegawa (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nPeru reaffirms its commitment to fighting impunity \r\nand to the work of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), a judicial institution that, in accordance with the \r\nprinciple of complementarity, is fundamental to efforts \r\nto prevent serious crimes from going unpunished. For \r\nthis reason, we welcome the report of the International \r\nCriminal Court on its activities during the 2016-\r\n2017 period (see A/72/349), presented today to the \r\nGeneral Assembly by the President of the Court, Judge \r\nSilvia Fernández de Gurmendi, as well as the report \r\non information relevant to the implementation of \r\narticle 3 of the Relationship Agreement between the \r\nUnited Nations and the International Criminal Court \r\n(A/72/342).\r\nFurthermore, my delegation looks forward to \r\nthe adoption by consensus of the draft resolution on \r\nthe report of the ICC (A/72/L.3), which we have also \r\nco-sponsored. In this regard, my delegation believes that \r\nthere is a convergence between the values and ideals of \r\nthe Rome Statute and the principles and purposes of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nAcknowledging the work of the bodies of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court pursuant to the Rome \r\nStatute, we wish to state — as a recent sign of our concrete \r\nsupport — that Peru ratified this year the Agreement \r\non the Privileges and Immunities of the Court, which \r\npromotes compliance on Peruvian territory with the \r\nmandate of the Court and its personnel. Indeed, this \r\nwork is reflected in the substantial caseload taken up \r\nby the Court since the beginning of its operations, \r\nnamely, 25 cases and investigations in 10 situations, as \r\nwell as 10  preliminary examinations currently being \r\nundertaken by the Office of the Prosecutor.\r\nNotwithstanding the ICC’s outstanding \r\nperformance, we recognize that international criminal \r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n14/30 17-35155\r\njustice continues to be a goal to which we aspire and \r\nthat the Court needs the constant support and decisive \r\ncooperation of States. Indeed, political support must \r\ncome not only from the States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute, but from all States Members of the United \r\nNations. Likewise, the States parties to the Statute \r\nhave a legal obligation to provide assistance to the \r\nCourt, including through the arrest and surrender of \r\nindividuals subject to outstanding arrest warrants. In \r\naddition, we highlight the importance the Court attaches \r\nto the participation of victims in its proceedings. This \r\nparticipation is essential to help fulfil the Court’s \r\nmandate and must be guaranteed at all stages of the \r\nprocess, be it individual or collective participation.\r\nPeru recognizes that the Court could be more \r\neffective and therefore supports the adoption of \r\npractical measures consistent with the Rome Statute that \r\nstreamline processes, thereby improving the Court’s \r\neffectiveness, including the proposed amendments, \r\nas long as they do not undermine due process or the \r\nrights of parties and victims. We also wish to state \r\nour concern about the Court’s financing, particularly \r\nin relation to those cases referred to it by the Security \r\nCouncil, pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Statute.\r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate the need to move \r\nforward towards comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, in particular with regard to its working \r\nmethods and the use of the veto, which is relevant in \r\nthe light of the imperative to prevent atrocious crimes. \r\nPeru therefore supports the initiatives of France and \r\nthe Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group \r\non the Code of Conduct regarding Security Council \r\naction against genocide, crimes against humanity or \r\nwar crimes.\r\nWith regard to the relationship between the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and the Security Council, \r\nmy delegation wishes to highlight the need to continue \r\nstrengthening their interaction and encourages \r\nincreased cooperation between them, including, if \r\npossible, between the Council’s sanctions committees \r\nand the Court.\r\nAs a member delegation of the Informal Ministerial \r\nNetwork for the International Criminal Court, we attach \r\nimportance to the universality of the Rome Statute and \r\nurge the 71 Member States that have not yet done so to \r\nconsider ratifying the Statute. Accordingly, we express \r\nour concern over the possibility that some States may \r\nchoose to withdraw from the Rome Statute.\r\nPeru is a peaceful and stable country that, thanks \r\nto the implementation of genuine accountability \r\nmechanisms, has overcome some serious internal \r\nconflicts. Such mechanisms are the best way to prevent \r\nthe recurrence of serious violations of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nLooking to the future, we believe that accountability \r\nand the fight against impunity are reflected in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, in particular \r\nwithin Goal 16. The Agenda is an important platform for \r\npromoting international justice within the framework \r\nof the rule of law and access to justice at the national \r\nand international levels.\r\nMs. Kuret (Slovenia): Slovenia welcomes today’s \r\ndebate on the activities of and latest developments \r\nin the International Criminal Court (ICC). Slovenia \r\naligns itself with the statement just made by the \r\nEuropean Union. In the light of the importance of the \r\nsubject matter before us, we would like to make some \r\nadditional comments.\r\nSlovenia joins others in thanking President \r\nFernández de Gurmendi for joining us here today and \r\nfor her helpful briefing on the latest report of the Court \r\n(see A/72/349). As a long-standing supporter of the \r\nICC, Slovenia takes this opportunity to reaffirm its \r\nstrong support for the Court.\r\nWe note with appreciation that the Court has \r\ncontinued to handle a heavy workload as it pursues its \r\nwork on the situations that spread across many regions \r\nof the world. It opened a new preliminary examination \r\nof the situation in Gabon, following its referral and \r\nsustained important efforts with respect to international \r\ncooperation and outreach activities.\r\nWith victims being at the centre of the Rome Statute \r\nsystem, we are particularly pleased to note the positive \r\ndevelopments concerning reparations to victims. \r\nAssistance to victims and reparations for their suffering \r\nand loss are essential for justice to be truly meaningful. \r\nThe Trust Fund for Victims plays an important role in \r\nthat respect, and, recognizing the increased activities \r\nand needs of the Trust Fund, I am pleased that Slovenia \r\nhas recently made a financial contribution to it.\r\nWe would also like to welcome the ratifications \r\nof and accessions to the Kampala amendments to the \r\nRome Statute. As the second State to have both ratified \r\nand implemented the Kampala amendments, Slovenia \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 15/30\r\ncontinues to promote the universality of the Rome \r\nStatute and the Amendments thereto.\r\nWe express our strong support for the swift \r\nactivation of the Court’s jurisdiction over the crime of \r\naggression, which is expected this year. That is the final \r\nstep needed for the historic achievement in Kampala to \r\nbe brought to life. My country is convinced that the \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute will be able to meet \r\nthat goal.\r\nThe ICC is the only permanent international \r\ncriminal court that serves the fundamental purpose of \r\noffering justice to victims when States are unable or \r\nunwilling to do so. Slovenia is particularly reassured \r\nthat following last year’s announcements of decisions \r\nto withdraw from the Rome Statute, two Member \r\nStates have revoked their decisions and thus continue \r\nto play a role within the Assembly of States Parties. \r\nIn that context, Slovenia wishes to highlight the \r\nimportance of making continuous efforts against the \r\nculture of impunity and stresses the significance of the \r\nprimary responsibility of States to combat impunity in \r\ngood faith.\r\nA great portion of this year’s report focuses on \r\ninternational cooperation, and rightly so. The ICC \r\nis certainly the key international institution for \r\nadministering criminal justice. However, lacking \r\nenforcement powers and outreach capacities, it \r\ndepends greatly on the cooperation and support of \r\nStates and civil society, as well as of regional and \r\ninternational organizations.\r\nSlovenia greatly values the many forms of mutual \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the ICC, \r\nboth in headquarters and in the peacekeeping missions \r\nand other United Nations presence in the field. United \r\nNations support is crucial, ranging from information \r\nexchange and provision of services, facilities and field \r\nsupport, to cooperation from the senior leadership of \r\nthe United Nations. Slovenia is pleased to note that \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the ICC \r\nis generally exemplary. At the same time, we recognize \r\nroom for improvement.\r\nSlovenia welcomes the Secretary-General’s call in \r\nthe latest report on the rule of law (A/72/268) to address \r\nthe outstanding challenges regarding the efficiency \r\nand sustainability of international accountability \r\nmechanisms. In that context, Slovenia considers that \r\nincreased cooperation between the Security Council \r\nand the ICC would contribute significantly to preventing \r\natrocity crimes, as well as to the effectiveness and \r\ncredibility of the Court.\r\nThe roles of the Council and the Court are \r\ninherently interrelated. For example, the Council has \r\nthe capacity to play an important part in addressing \r\nnon-cooperation with the Court. It can contribute \r\nto the Court’s effectiveness through its work on \r\nsanction-related matters, such as travel bans and the \r\nfreezing of assets. Moreover, active follow-up by the \r\nCouncil on its referrals to the ICC would decisively \r\ncontribute to the Court’s effectiveness.\r\nDespite the fact that, admittedly, some of the \r\noutstanding issues are more challenging — such as the \r\nmatter of funding with respect to the situations referred \r\nto the ICC by the Council — that should not preclude us \r\nfrom addressing them. With a view to exploring avenues \r\nfor improved cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the ICC, Slovenia would welcome open exchange \r\nand structured dialogue between the Council and the \r\nCourt. The fast-approaching twentieth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of the Rome Statute is an appropriate \r\nopportunity to call for increased efforts to that end.\r\nCooperation with the ICC by States parties to the \r\nRome Statute, as well as by States that are not parties \r\nin the case of Security Council referrals, is not a policy \r\nchoice. It is an international legal obligation. Slovenia \r\nis concerned that 15 arrest warrants issued by the Court \r\nremain outstanding, some of them for several years. \r\nThat is a serious obstacle to the Court’s mandate and \r\ncredibility. It is clear that more should be done by \r\nStates to ensure the execution of outstanding warrants. \r\nSlovenia therefore calls for full and prompt cooperation \r\nwith the Court.\r\nThe Court’s efficiency and integrity are also \r\ncritical for its credibility. In that regard, Slovenia \r\nwelcomes the continuous efforts within the Court to \r\nintroduce further improvements to the efficiency and \r\neffectiveness of its proceedings. We recognize the \r\nimportance of addressing the challenges facing the \r\nCourt. The Court is not exempt from criticism, and it \r\nhas already lived through some challenging moments. \r\nIn that context, Slovenia underlines the important role \r\nof internal processes and of the Independent Oversight \r\nMechanism of the Court. We place our trust in the \r\nMechanism and are confident that through its work the \r\nCourt will continue to reinforce its integrity.\r\nOur common goal should be an impartial, \r\nindependent, universal and effective ICC that delivers \r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n16/30 17-35155\r\nhigh-quality judgments and places victims at the \r\ncentre of its tasks. That will require joint efforts by all \r\nstakeholders. Slovenia remains firmly committed to \r\nthe rule of law and international criminal justice and \r\nstands ready to contribute to further strengthening \r\ninternational criminal justice.\r\nMr. Bessho (Japan): I would like to begin by \r\nthanking President Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi \r\nfor her dedication and leadership, as well as for the \r\ncomprehensive report (see A/72/349) on the work of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC). I would also \r\nlike to thank Mexico for preparing and introducing \r\ntoday’s draft resolution (A/72/L.3). Japan is happy to \r\nco-sponsor the draft resolution and strongly hopes that \r\nit will be adopted by consensus.\r\nJapan is committed to the fight against impunity \r\nand to supporting the International Criminal Court. \r\nEarlier this year, the President of the ICC, Judge Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi, visited Tokyo and met with \r\nPrime Minister Abe and other high-level officials of the \r\nGovernment of Japan. In their discussions, they talked \r\nabout the importance of promoting the universality of \r\nthe Rome Statute, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. \r\nPrime Minister Abe reiterated Japan’s support for the \r\nICC and expressed his hope that it will play a greater \r\nrole, thereby contributing to the establishment of the \r\nrule of law in the international community.\r\nJapan’s core policy towards the Court is to enable \r\nit to function effectively and sustainably with the \r\nsupport of the international community. Japan is \r\nproud to be the largest financial contributor to the \r\nCourt. We are also dedicated to supporting the Court \r\nthrough capable human resources, including judges. \r\nTwo Japanese staff have also joined the ICC for the \r\nfirst time this year through its new Junior Professional \r\nOfficers programme.\r\nJapan believes that the ICC has contributed to \r\nsteady progress in international justice. The Court \r\nhas been exercising its jurisdiction over 10 situations, \r\nand 10 preliminary examinations are ongoing. \r\nNevertheless, we are aware that financial and human \r\nresources are limited, and we believe that they should \r\nbe used efficiently. With that in mind, the Japanese \r\nAmbassador to the Netherlands, Mr. Hiroshi Inomata, \r\nhas been working with Chile to co-chair the Study \r\nGroup on Governance to enhance the efficiency of the \r\nCourt. We also welcome the ICC’s efforts to improve the \r\nefficiency of proceedings, including through a retreat \r\nfor the judges. We strongly believe that those exercises \r\nundertaken by the States parties and the Court can help \r\nalleviate its workload.\r\nJapan strongly believes that to ensure that the ICC \r\neffectively promotes the rule of law around the world, \r\nmore countries should join the ICC. In the long run, the \r\nICC should aim at becoming a truly universal criminal \r\ncourt so that it can gain strong support for its work. We \r\ntherefore welcome the decisions by The Gambia and \r\nSouth Africa to rescind their withdrawal from the ICC. \r\nIn order to maximize support from a greater number of \r\nStates, the ICC and its States parties should continue \r\nto listen to the various concerns expressed and make \r\nefforts to enhance the ICC’s universality.\r\nIn that regard, we welcome the understanding on \r\nthe participation of observer States in meetings of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties. We hope that will lead to \r\nmore States becoming parties to the Rome Statute. \r\nAlso in the same vein, in August this year, Japan, \r\ntogether with the Netherlands and the ICC, hosted an \r\noutreach event in Tokyo involving non-States parties \r\nin the Asia-Pacific region to share Japan’s experience \r\nin acceding to the Rome Statute and harmonizing its \r\ndomestic legislation with it. In April, Ambassador \r\nTomoko Akane — Public Prosecutor, Supreme Public \r\nProsecutors Office of Japan and candidate for ICC \r\njudge — also shared Japan’s experience with non-States \r\nparties at an ICC high-level regional seminar held in \r\nSeoul for the same purpose.\r\nDiscussions are ongoing on the activation of \r\nthe ICC’s jurisdiction in the crime of aggression. I \r\nwould like to express my gratitude to the facilitator of \r\nthe process for all the excellent work in steering the \r\nfacilitation with professionalism and dedication, which \r\nis not an easy task.\r\nReiterating the importance of legal clarity, we \r\nstrongly hope that the Assembly of States Parties \r\nremains united for the effective and sustainable \r\nfunctioning of the ICC. Japan stands ready to continue \r\nto engage actively in the discussions in order to work \r\ntowards a consensus-based solution.\r\nJapan will continue to strongly support the ICC’s \r\nwork in the fight against impunity. Earlier this year, \r\nwe were pleased to donate the Peace and Justice Bell to \r\nthe Court as a symbol of this ongoing commitment. We \r\nhope that the Bell will serve as a reminder to all visitors \r\nto the Court that we all strive for peace and justice \r\nthrough supporting the important work of the ICC.\r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 17/30\r\nMr. Castro Córdoba (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My delegation thanks Judge Silvia Fernández \r\nde Gurmendi, President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, for the presentation of the report on the activities \r\nof the Court for 2016-2017 (see A/72/349), pursuant to \r\narticle 6 of the Relationship Agreement between the \r\nUnited Nations and the International Criminal Court \r\nand paragraph 28 of resolution 71/253.\r\nThe International Criminal Court is undeniably the \r\nmost important achievement of international justice. It \r\nwas born from the will of the international community \r\nto put an end to impunity for the most serious crimes \r\nagainst humanity and to deliver justice to their victims. \r\nIts very essence and its main strength derive from \r\nthe fact that the yearning for justice is universal. The \r\nworld requires that there be no State where impunity \r\nis allowed.\r\nTherefore we welcome the actions intended to \r\nbring about the universality of the Rome Statute \r\nand its amendments. In that regard, we congratulate \r\nPortugal and Argentina for having ratified the Kampala \r\namendments on the crime of aggression, bringing \r\nthe number of ratifying States to 34. Costa Rica also \r\nwelcomes the fact that South Africa and The Gambia \r\nhave reconsidered their decisions to withdraw from \r\nthe Court, and we urge all States parties to continue \r\nworking to achieve universality.\r\nWith regard to the victims, my delegation recognizes \r\nand welcomes the fact that the Trust Fund and its \r\nimplementing partners at the local level are continuing \r\nto provide assistance to more than 455,000 victims, in \r\nboth Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nby providing physical and psychological rehabilitation \r\nservices and material support to survivors of crimes \r\ndefined in the Statute. We are also struck by the fact \r\nthat in the reporting period, the Court has received a \r\ntotal of 4,725 requests for participation or reparation \r\nfrom victims. That is a reflection of the importance and \r\nthe central role of the Court for the victims of the most \r\nheinous crimes under international law.\r\nReturning to the common goal of ending impunity \r\nfor heinous crimes, we cannot forget that the Court \r\nundeniably functions pursuant to the principle of \r\ncomplementarity. It was not established to replace \r\nnational courts in their functions. Here, we need to \r\nreaffirm that the primary obligation to put an end to \r\nimpunity for the most heinous crimes falls to States in \r\nthe responsible exercise of their sovereignty.\r\nState sovereignty imposes obligations, among \r\nthem that of investigating and prosecuting crimes \r\ncommitted under the State’s jurisdiction. Pursuant to \r\narticle 17, paragraph (a) of the Statute, only when a \r\nState party “is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry \r\nout the investigation or the prosecution” is it possible \r\nfor a matter to be brought before the International \r\nCriminal Court. For that reason, complementarity \r\nis therefore an essential element in the machinery of \r\ninternational justice.\r\nHowever, it is vital to be clear that when the \r\njurisdiction of the Court applies, States parties must \r\ncomply with the unrenounceable duties arising from \r\nthe Rome Statute. It is particularly serious when \r\nnon-compliance results in the refusal to provide the \r\nrequired support to the investigations of the Office \r\nof the Prosecutor, preventing or hindering access to \r\nevidence, which can disrupt a process, opening the way \r\nfor impunity. Likewise, the fight against impunity is \r\nhindered whenever a State party fails in its obligation \r\nto carry out arrest warrants. The lack of cooperation \r\nwith the Court in carrying out such orders also impedes \r\nthe justice that the victims demand and deserve.\r\nNon-cooperation with the Court under the argument \r\nthat it is not impartial because a high percentage of its \r\ncases are in the same region is not acceptable. It is time \r\nfor us to change our narrative. Those who make that \r\nargument fail to recognize that the situations in Mali, \r\nCôte D’Ivoire, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo and the two in the Central African Republic \r\nwere referred to the Court by the Governments of those \r\ncountries. As for the situations in Libya and the Sudan, \r\nthey were referred by the Security Council. Only 2 out \r\nof 10 situations were initiated by the Court itself: the \r\nsituations in Kenya and Georgia. It would be absurd \r\nto claim that the Prosecutor’s Office rejects referrals \r\nfrom States parties in order to maintain a geographical \r\nbalance in their cases.\r\nSince its inception, the Court has dealt with a \r\ntotal of 25 cases and carried out investigations in 10 \r\nsituations. In addition to its investigations, the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor is currently conducting 10 preliminary \r\nexaminations, including a preliminary investigation \r\nsubmitted by the Gabonese Republic on alleged crimes \r\ncommitted in its territory since May 2016.\r\nTo be able to continue complying with its mandate, \r\nthe ICC requires the support and cooperation of the \r\nentire international community, in particular the \r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n18/30 17-35155\r\nUnited Nations, with which it shares the ideals of \r\naccountability, the protection of human rights and the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In \r\nthat regard, we welcome the fact that the Court had the \r\nvaluable cooperation of the United Nations on various \r\nissues, such as operational assistance in the field, the \r\nprovision of United Nations personnel for interviews \r\nand, on several occasions, for testimonies, and the \r\ndisclosure of information by the United Nations, \r\nprovided on a reimbursable basis.\r\nHowever, my delegation reiterates the need for \r\nthe United Nations to participate in financing the \r\nreferrals by the Security Council to the Criminal Court. \r\nThe Charter of the United Nations holds the Council \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, and by assuming those referrals, the Court \r\nis helping that organ to fulfil its mandate. In those \r\ncases of cooperation, article 13 of the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the Court and the United Nations, \r\nwhich provides for the economic contribution of the \r\nUnited Nations, must apply.\r\nTo conclude, Costa Rica wishes to emphasize \r\nits complete support for the Criminal Court and its \r\ncommitment to continue supporting the universalization, \r\nindependence and integrity of the Court so that, in \r\nconjunction with the other States parties, and with the \r\nsupport of the community of nations, we guarantee \r\nrespect for and the fulfilment of international justice.\r\nMr. Racoviţă (Romania): Further to the statement \r\ndelivered by the European Union, to which Romania \r\nsubscribes fully, the Romanian delegation would like \r\nto thank President Fernández de Gurmendi for her \r\nthorough presentation and the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) for its annual report submitted to the \r\nUnited Nations (see A/72/349).\r\nWhile the International Criminal Court is still under \r\ndevelopment and has not reached its full potential, we \r\nagree that the Court has established itself as an integral \r\npart of the international legal system. The existence of \r\nthe ICC represents an important guarantor of the rights \r\nof the millions of victims of atrocity crimes around \r\nthe world and provides an essential contribution to the \r\nfight against impunity and the establishment of the rule \r\nof law.\r\nThe heavy workload highlighted in this report \r\npoints yet again to the need for a permanent \r\ninternational criminal court and to the importance of \r\nenhancing the Court’s efficiency and effectiveness. \r\nIn that respect, we welcome the reform measures \r\nundertaken to improve the performance and governance \r\nof the International Criminal Court and encourage their \r\nfurther implementation. We also note the rising number \r\nof situations submitted by States, which we see as a sign \r\nof increasing trust in the Court’s capacity to deliver \r\nhigh-quality justice. As it navigates in politically tense \r\nenvironments, the independent judicial machinery of \r\nthe ICC is staying the course. Yet, challenges persist, \r\nand more efforts should be made to ensure full and \r\nprompt cooperation with the Court, especially with \r\nregard to arrests and the surrender of suspects.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the Court continues to \r\nreceive valuable support from the United Nations, both \r\nfrom Headquarters and from United Nations missions \r\nin the field. At the same time, we express support \r\nfor actions meant to further explore and strengthen \r\ncooperation between the Court and the Security \r\nCouncil in the area of preventing the commission of \r\ncrimes under the Rome Statute and in facilitating the \r\narrest of suspected individuals. In that context, we \r\ncaution against the negative effects on the credibility \r\nof the criminal justice system caused by the lack of \r\nfollow-up by the Security Council to reported instances \r\nof non-cooperation in the case of its own referrals to \r\nthe ICC. Consequently, we join the calls for finding \r\nappropriate ways to address this problem.\r\nOn a general note, we support the activities aimed \r\nat enhancing judicial cooperation and at garnering \r\ndiplomatic support and greater awareness of the Court’s \r\nmandate. While each State should deliver on its legal \r\nobligations stemming from the Rome Statute and/or \r\nresolutions of the Security Council, the ICC, together \r\nwith supportive States, should invest in communicating \r\nbetter about its work, including in direct dialogue \r\nwith the countries concerned and in addressing \r\nlingering misperceptions.\r\nAchieving the universality of the Rome Statute \r\nremains a long-term goal, to be pursued jointly by the \r\nCourt and the States parties. We welcome the decisions \r\nby South Africa and The Gambia to reverse their \r\nprevious decisions to withdraw from the 1998 Statute. \r\nThose latest developments have demonstrated the need \r\nfor more constructive dialogue with States so as to \r\nunderstand and address their concerns, without affecting \r\nthe integrity of the Statute. Prosecuting high-profile \r\nindividuals for atrocity crimes is inherently marred \r\nby political and practical challenges, but we should all \r\nkeep in mind the victims of unspeakable crimes, who \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 19/30\r\nplace their ultimate trust in the international justice \r\nsystem. It is in that spirit that Romania will continue to \r\nactively promote the ratification and effective domestic \r\nimplementation of the Rome Statute and the Agreement \r\non Privileges and Immunities of the Court.\r\nAs the ICC is a court of last resort, Romania \r\nstrongly supports the Rome Statute system based on \r\nthe principle of complementarity. Given that States \r\ncarry the primary responsibility to investigate and \r\nprosecute the crimes defined in the Rome Statute, \r\nstrengthening their capacity to do so effectively is \r\ncrucial to the global fight to end impunity. As a country \r\nfocal point for complementarity since February 2017, \r\nRomania has been working to facilitate the exchange of \r\ninformation between the Court, States parties and other \r\nrelevant stakeholders aimed at strengthening domestic \r\njurisdictions, including on complementarity-related \r\ncapacity-building activities.\r\nThe activity of the Court should not be evaluated \r\nin simplistic, quantitative terms, but with due \r\nconsideration to its long-term impact, serving as a \r\ndeterrent to the most serious crimes under international \r\nlaw and as a powerful tool to advance the culture of \r\naccountability globally.\r\nMs. Bird (Australia): When we met to consider \r\nthis agenda item a year ago, Australia acknowledged \r\nthat the International Criminal Court (ICC) was facing \r\nmore challenges than ever before and the need to work \r\nwith States that had raised concerns. While that work \r\nis ongoing — and we are disappointed by Burundi’s \r\nwithdrawal from the Rome Statute — we welcome the \r\ndecisions of The Gambia and South Africa to rescind \r\ntheir withdrawals.\r\nWe also welcome the fact that States parties, civil \r\nsociety and individual citizens around the world have \r\nrallied around the ICC to confirm their commitment to \r\nthe Court. Above all, we welcome the fact that the Court \r\nhas not wavered in seeking to fulfil its mandate and has \r\nmade significant progress in the fight to end impunity \r\nover the past year, as demonstrated by the report that \r\nPresident Fernández de Gurmendi has presented today \r\n(see A/72/349).\r\nHowever, we do not pretend that no more challenges \r\nlie ahead. The ICC’s mandate to hold to account those \r\nmost responsible for serious international crimes — who \r\nall too often are among the most powerful — is likely to \r\nmean that the Court will always have more than its fair \r\nshare of critics. States parties must engage in greater \r\noutreach to help explain the Court’s mandate and build \r\nsupport for its work. Australia will continue to work \r\nwith all States to ensure that the Court is the strongest \r\npossible institution that it can be.\r\nThe ICC and the United Nations are striving \r\nto achieve the same goals. In the Preamble to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, the goal is framed as \r\nsaving succeeding generations from the scourge of \r\nwar. The preamble of the Rome Statute expresses it \r\nas a determination to put an end to impunity for the \r\nperpetrators of unimaginable atrocities that deeply \r\nshock the conscience of humankind. Just as the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security is the \r\nfirst purpose of the United Nations — as listed in Article \r\n1 of the Charter — the Rome Statute makes clear that \r\nthe crimes over which the ICC has jurisdiction threaten \r\nthe peace, security and well-being of the world, and that \r\neffective prosecution will contribute to the prevention \r\nof such crimes.\r\nThe point is that the ICC is a key partner of the \r\nUnited Nations. As a key partner, it is critical that \r\nthe United Nations provides the ICC with the support \r\nit needs to deliver on its mandate. We welcome the \r\nsupport provided to the Court by the United Nations \r\nand encourage the Secretary-General to continue \r\nto enhance cooperation in accordance with the \r\nRelationship Agreement.\r\nWe have, however, heard the Prosecutor’s repeated \r\nrequests for effective Security Council follow-up and \r\nsupport each time she briefs the Council on the situations \r\nthe Council has referred to the ICC under resolutions \r\n1593 (2005) and 1970 (2011). It is essential that referrals \r\nbe accompanied by the Council’s clear demonstration of \r\nongoing political support to emphasize the shared goal \r\nof ending impunity, reiterate the obligations that States \r\nare under to cooperate with the Court, and minimize \r\nany possible perception that the ICC is subject to the \r\nwill of the Council. We are disappointed that that \r\nsupport has not yet been forthcoming, and we call on \r\nthe Security Council to provide the necessary support \r\nto the Court.\r\nIf we are committed to reorienting this Organization \r\nto focus on prevention, we must not neglect the deterrent \r\neffect of consistent and reliable justice. When States \r\nwith jurisdiction are unable or unwilling to investigate \r\nand prosecute Rome Statute crimes, the ICC has a \r\ncritical role to play.\r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n20/30 17-35155\r\nWould-be perpetrators will think twice if they \r\nknow that the General Assembly stands behind the \r\nICC and that the international community is serious \r\nabout holding to account those responsible for serious \r\ninternational crimes. Victims will no longer feel ignored \r\nif their voices are heard. Affected communities will \r\nstart to heal if accountability is used to break cycles \r\nof violence. For that reason, we urge those Member \r\nStates that have not already done so to ratify the Rome \r\nStatute. We also call on the General Assembly to fulfil \r\nits role in the vital partnership between the ICC and the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Weckowicz (Poland): Poland aligns itself with \r\nthe statement made by the observer of the European \r\nUnion on behalf of its member States. We would like to \r\nsupplement that statement with a few comments in our \r\nnational capacity.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to thank President Fernández \r\nde Gurmendi for her thorough briefing on the Court’s \r\nactivities in the reporting period. The International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) has strived to maintain the \r\nhighest standards of proceedings and proved again its \r\nimportance in delivering justice to the victims. For \r\nthat, we commend the Court.\r\nWe also applaud the efforts to enhance the \r\nefficiency of the Court and to expedite its work. Poland \r\nhad the honour of hosting the judges of the Court in May \r\nduring a judicial retreat in Kraków, where those issues, \r\namong others, were discussed. During their stay, the \r\njudges also visited the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial \r\nand Museum — the former Nazi concentration and \r\nextermination camp where the most serious crimes \r\nwere committed.\r\nObviously, the Court cannot deliver justice on \r\nits own, hence the importance of complementarity, \r\ncooperation and the assistance of States. Moreover, \r\nthe connection should be recognized between the rule \r\nof law, respect for international law, and support for \r\ncriminal justice mechanisms. In our view, not only can \r\nthe ICC contribute to the fight against impunity and to \r\nthe prevention of the most serious crimes, it can also \r\nplay a vital role in upholding international law and \r\nrules-based order in challenging times. That is one \r\nmore reason to lend the ICC all possible support.\r\nWe have no doubts that bringing to justice the \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes is one of the \r\nfactors that may foster peaceful coexistence among \r\nnations, and that the International Criminal Court \r\ncan also serve that aim. Poland, which is an incoming \r\nmember of the Security Council for 2018-2019, \r\nrecognizes that a more productive cooperation between \r\nthe Council and the Court could render a significant \r\nservice to the cause of international peace and security.\r\nThe Rome Statute creates a system in which States \r\nare equal in their rights and obligations and in which \r\nevery State is free to join or leave. While 124 is a \r\nsignificant number of accessions or ratifications, Poland \r\nhopes that that number will increase and supports \r\nthe universalization of the Statute. We welcomed the \r\nnews about the Republic of South Africa and The \r\nGambia revoking their decisions to withdraw from the \r\nRome Statute.\r\nWe would like to underline our commitment to \r\nactivating the ICC’s jurisdiction over the crime of \r\naggression. The Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute took place already seven years ago in Kampala, \r\nand since then 34 States parties, including Poland, \r\nhave ratified the amendment. There is only one final \r\ncondition that needs to be met in order to accomplish \r\nactivation, and Poland hopes that the Assembly of States \r\nParties to the Rome Statute will approve the activation \r\nof the Court’s jurisdiction in December this year.\r\nThroughout history, Poland has repeatedly \r\nfallen victim to aggression. Its inhabitants have \r\nsuffered unprecedented crimes perpetrated by \r\ninvaders — particularly during the Second World War. \r\nIt is our dream to save others from such cruelties, and \r\nthe Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute on the \r\ncrime of aggression are a step in the right direction.\r\nPoland supports the ICC in its efforts to achieve \r\njustice and peace in different parts of the world in the \r\nbelief that the international community should draw \r\nconclusions from history, do its best to prevent the \r\nsuffering of innocent people and bring those responsible \r\nfor it to justice. Strengthened cooperation between the \r\nCourt and international actors could serve those lofty \r\naims. Let us work further towards their fulfilment.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Lichtenstein): I would like to thank \r\nPresident Fernández de Gurmendi for her outstanding \r\nservice to the cause of international criminal justice. \r\nThis is the last time that she will present a report of the \r\nCourt to the Assembly, and we will miss her.\r\nThe Rome Statute is nearing the twentieth \r\nanniversary of its adoption. Its history has been \r\neventful, and it has been a success. The difficult \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 21/30\r\nagreement reached in Rome was followed by a very fast \r\nratification process. A wave of collective enthusiasm \r\nand strong commitment to multilateralism carried \r\nthe Court forward at an unexpected speed. However, \r\nthe Court also soon experienced strong opposition, \r\na systematic effort to undermine its independent \r\nfunctioning, and those political headwinds have \r\ncontinued to this day. That should come as no surprise. \r\nThe Court’s mandate is to investigate and prosecute \r\nthe most serious crimes under international law. Its \r\npolicy is to identify the individuals who bear the largest \r\nresponsibility for those crimes. Those individuals can \r\nbe in very powerful positions, including Head of State. \r\nThat is almost bound to result in political opposition \r\nand attacks against the very mandate of the Court.\r\nThe Court does not find itself in a confrontation \r\nwith a particular region of the world. Rather, it is \r\na confrontation with those who believe that some \r\nindividuals should be beyond the reach of the law — a \r\nview that continues to exist in all parts of the world, \r\neven though it is firmly rejected by both the letter and \r\nthe spirit of the Rome Statute. In speaking for the Court \r\ntoday, we are therefore not simply defending a landmark \r\nachievement in the history of international law; we are \r\nalso speaking law to power.\r\nA few weeks from now, States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute will have the opportunity to do the same, to \r\nspeak law to power on an issue whose relevance could \r\nnot be more obvious today: criminalizing the most \r\nserious forms of the illegal use of force. Regulating the \r\nuse of force was one of the key objectives in creating \r\nthe United Nations, and it also stood at the beginning \r\nof the international criminal justice project — the trials \r\nconducted in Nuremberg and Tokyo.\r\nAt the Rome Conference, many States felt that \r\nthe greatest international criminal-justice project \r\ncould be complete only if the crime of aggression was \r\npart of it. After very difficult discussions, the crime \r\nwas indeed included as one of the four core crimes \r\nin the jurisdiction of the Court. However, exercise of \r\njurisdiction was deferred until agreement on a definition \r\nwas found. That agreement was reached, after years of \r\npainstaking legal work, at the Review Conference on \r\nthe Rome Statute that took place in 2010 in Kampala. \r\nStates adopted by consensus all the relevant provisions \r\nfor the Court to be able to exercise jurisdiction over \r\nthe crime of aggression. Those same States also agreed \r\nthat the Kampala amendments would be activated once \r\nat least 30 States had ratified them and no earlier than \r\n1 January 2017. With 34 ratifications in place, we are \r\nnow finally in a position to make that historic decision.\r\nThe main features of the Kampala amendments are \r\nworth recalling. Only persons in leadership positions \r\nare criminally accountable. Not all forms of the illegal \r\nuse of force lead to criminal accountability; only the \r\nmost serious forms that constitute by their character, \r\ngravity and scale a manifest violation of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations amount to acts of aggression.\r\nThe Court can investigate on the basis of a Security \r\nCouncil determination, in accordance with Article \r\n39 of the Charter. However, more importantly, in the \r\nabsence of such a determination, the Court can still \r\nbecome involved as a result of relevant findings of the \r\nCourt itself. The amendments thus fully safeguard the \r\njudicial independence of the Court.\r\nFinally, while the nationals of non-State parties \r\nare exempt from the Court’s jurisdiction altogether, the \r\njurisdiction does apply between States parties if two \r\nconditions are met. First, one of the States involved in the \r\nconflict must have ratified the Kampala amendments. \r\nSecondly, the State alleged to have committed the act \r\nof aggression must not have declared that its nationals \r\nare not subject to the Court’s jurisdiction.\r\nThis briefly illustrates the key features of the \r\nKampala amendments. First, they are to a very large \r\nextent based on pre-existing international law, just like \r\nthe rest of the Rome Statute. Secondly, the scope of \r\njurisdiction agreed in Kampala is deep, and it is narrow. \r\nIt excludes, most significantly, all nationals of the 70 \r\nStates that have yet to join the Rome Statute — in stark \r\ncontrast to the rest of the jurisdiction foreseen under the \r\nRome Statute. In addition, it also gives States parties the \r\npolicy choice not to subject its nationals to the Court’s \r\njurisdiction, even if they are to commit the crime of \r\naggression on the territory of a State that has ratified \r\nthe amendments. The Kampala consensus thus bears all \r\nthe hallmarks of compromise, which can come as little \r\nsurprise, given the legal and political difficulties of the \r\nproject as a whole.\r\nThere has been much talk recently of the application \r\nof the Kampala regime to States parties that have not \r\nratified the amendment. The solution agreed upon in \r\nKampala is straightforward: while the amendments \r\nindeed bind only the States that have ratified them, \r\nratifying States at the same time enjoy the legal \r\nprotection against crimes of aggression committed on \r\ntheir territory. That simply reflects the principle of \r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n22/30 17-35155\r\nterritoriality, which in fact guides the Rome Statute as \r\na whole.\r\nThat said, we are confident that our efforts to bridge \r\nthat difference of opinion among States parties will be \r\nsuccessful in the next few weeks. We are very much \r\ncommitted to reaching that goal with States parties. \r\nThe activation of the Kampala amendments will send \r\na strong message of the common sense of purpose \r\namong States parties and illustrate the importance of \r\nmultilateralism. It will not only complete the Rome \r\nStatute in its original conception, but it will also \r\ncomplement the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Cho Tae-yul (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express my sincere appreciation \r\nto President Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi for her \r\ncomprehensive presentation of the report (see A/72/349). \r\nMy delegation also commends the joint efforts by the \r\npresidency, the Chambers, the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nand the Registry to help achieve an end to impunity \r\nfor perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern \r\nto the international community through various means, \r\nincluding the improvement of the functioning of the \r\nCourt in a more efficient and effective manner.\r\nAmong the remarkable achievements the Court \r\nhas made so far, we note that it issued a judgment \r\non charges of offences against the administration of \r\njustice, the first ever in its history. We also welcome \r\nthe contribution made by the Trust Fund for Victims, \r\nwhich has helped alleviate the pains of almost half a \r\nmillion victims.\r\nWith the twentieth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Rome Statute less than a year away, now is the \r\ntime for the United Nations and the Court to work more \r\nclosely together and to reassert the relevance and the \r\nimportance of international criminal justice in securing \r\nthe rule of law and international peace and security.\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) was \r\nestablished as an independent permanent court in \r\nrelationship with the United Nations. The fundamental \r\ntenet of this relationship envisioned in the Rome Statute \r\nis encapsulated in the reaffirmation of the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations in \r\nthe preamble of the Statute, which has been faithfully \r\nupheld and implemented in the actual practice of \r\nthe Court.\r\nIndeed, we cannot overemphasize the significant \r\nrole that the ICC has played through its work to sustain \r\nthe three pillars of the United Nations, namely, peace \r\nand security, development, and human rights. Securing \r\ncriminal justice for perpetrators of heinous crimes \r\nthat shock the conscience of humanity constitutes part \r\nand parcel of the rule of law, which provides a solid \r\nbasis for the successful implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. For that reason, \r\nwe support the ongoing cooperation between the Court \r\nand the United Nations on various levels, as set out in \r\nthe report and presentation.\r\nWhile the progress made on its path to ending \r\nimpunity is quite remarkable, the Court has also \r\nfaced a harsh reality on various fronts. To firmly \r\nestablish itself as a robust and reliable institution \r\nfor international criminal justice, the Court should \r\novercome considerable challenges, with the help of \r\nvarious stakeholders, most notably States parties.\r\nFirst, as an international court, the ICC cannot \r\nsustain itself without the active cooperation of multiple \r\nstakeholders, especially States parties, at each and \r\nevery step of the process. To promote efforts towards \r\nuniversality and to enhance cooperation with States, it \r\nis critical that the Court further reach out to interested \r\nregions, States and relevant organizations. In that \r\ncontext, the eighth high-level regional seminar on \r\nfostering cooperation with the Court, which was held \r\nin Seoul in April, provided an invaluable opportunity \r\nfor enhanced understanding of the ICC on the part of \r\nAsia-Pacific States.\r\nWhile the cooperation between the ICC and States \r\nparties is vital for the proper functioning of the system, it \r\nis also indispensable for the Court to secure cooperation \r\nvis-à-vis the Assembly of States Parties, the United \r\nNations and other international organizations, civil-\r\nsociety organizations and non-party States. Against \r\nthat backdrop, it is regrettable that the Court-issued \r\nrequests for arrest and surrender are still outstanding \r\nfor 15 individuals. That requires tremendous and \r\nunyielding efforts by all of us, as exemplified by recent \r\ninstances of non-cooperation.\r\nSecondly, the success of our fight against impunity \r\nhinges not only on adequate cooperation but also on the \r\nuniversal application of the Rome Statute. The number \r\nof States parties to the Rome Statute has more than \r\ndoubled since its entry into force in 2002, a remarkable \r\nachievement indeed. Nevertheless, the number still \r\nfalls short of two thirds of the Members of the United \r\nNations. The wider participation of States in the Rome \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 23/30\r\nStatute would undoubtedly lead to stronger support \r\nfor the Court. In that respect, we welcome the wise \r\ndecisions of The Gambia and South Africa concerning \r\ntheir respective membership of the ICC family. We also \r\nencourage the remaining State to follow suit.\r\nThirdly, given the ever-increasing caseloads \r\nthat the Court faces today, it is imperative that the \r\nICC improve efficiency at various stages, while not \r\nlosing sight of the importance of striking a balance \r\nbetween fairness and expediency. In that regard, we \r\nappreciate the Court’s continued focus on streamlining \r\nits procedures by updating the Chambers Practice \r\nManual with additional best practices, as well as by \r\nadopting meaningful amendments to the Regulations \r\nof the Court. Such initiatives are conducive not only \r\nto enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the \r\nfunctioning of the Court but also to garnering the \r\nbroader support and trust of States parties.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has been a staunch supporter \r\nof the ICC since its inception. We will continue to \r\nbe an important part of the concerted efforts of the \r\ninternational community to establish the ICC as a \r\nresponsible, universal and efficient institution to end \r\nimpunity for perpetrators of the most serious crimes \r\nagainst humanity. In that vein, we have full confidence \r\nin the able and accommodating leadership of the \r\nincoming President of the Assembly of States Parties, \r\nMr. O-Gon Kwon, and we will provide adequate \r\nassistance to him in discharging his important duty.\r\nBefore concluding my remarks, I would like to \r\ncommend the vital role of President Silvia Fernández \r\nde Gurmendi in leading the Court towards maturity as \r\na dedicated President and as a passionate judge of the \r\nCourt for the past nine years.\r\nMr. Garcia Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): It is a great pleasure for me to address the \r\nAssembly with you, Sir, in the Chair.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to express the great \r\nappreciation of the Argentine Republic at receiving \r\nthis new report of the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, our compatriot Silvia Fernández de \r\nGurmendi, to whom we pay tribute for her tireless work \r\nas President of the Court. I also wish to express my \r\ngreat appreciation for reports of the Secretary-General \r\non the implementation of article 3 of the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (A/72/342) and on the \r\nexpenses incurred and reimbursement received by the \r\nUnited Nations in connection with assistance provided \r\nto the International Criminal Court (A/72/372).\r\nWe look forward to the adoption this year of the \r\ndraft resolution on the report of the International \r\nCriminal Court (A/72/L.3), in conjunction with the \r\npresentation of the report of the Court by the President \r\nand the debate on the relevant agenda item.\r\nThe Court, through the laudable work that it has \r\ncarried out since the last presentation of the report (see \r\nA/71/PV.37), has once again factually demonstrated that \r\nit is a fundamental tool in the fight against impunity and \r\nan essential element of the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel. On the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Rome Statute, Argentina reaffirms its \r\nongoing commitment to the Court and to the universal \r\nnature of the Statute. Such support by Argentina \r\nis evident in various ways, among which we would \r\nnote the signing of cooperation agreements with the \r\nCourt — one on the issue of witness protection, signed \r\non 21 November 2016, and another agreement related \r\nto the enforcement of sentences, which was signed on \r\n18 April 2017.\r\nArgentina has also ratified the Kampala \r\namendments on the crime of aggression and welcomes \r\nthe fact that the threshold of necessary ratifications \r\nhas been reached to enable the Court to exercise its \r\njurisdiction over that crime. Argentina resolutely \r\nsupports the triggering of such jurisdiction by the \r\nAssembly of State Parties in December 2017 without \r\nprejudice to or reopening of the agreements reached \r\nin Kampala. Such triggering will complete the judicial \r\nstructure of the Court, reaffirming the prevalence of \r\nlaw and justice over force in international relations.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the Court has been able \r\nto develop its activities relating both to preliminary \r\nexaminations and to situations and cases in the \r\ndischarge of its mandate within the limits of allocated \r\nresources. In that regard, we call on all Member States \r\nto become parties to the Rome Statute and to bear in \r\nmind the particular nature of the International Criminal \r\nCourt when assessing its annual budget so that the \r\nbudget may be approved at the next Assembly of States \r\nParties. allowing the Court to fulfil its mandate and \r\nappropriately perform its crucial functions.\r\nI would like to refer to the relationship of the Court \r\nwith the United Nations. The relationship between \r\nthe Organization and the Court is vital, always within \r\nrespect for the judicial independence of the Court. In \r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n24/30 17-35155\r\nthis context, we reiterate some of Argentina’s concerns \r\nregarding the referrals of situations by the Security \r\nCouncil, particularly the matter of the financial cost of \r\nsuch referrals. Those costs have so far been exclusively \r\nborne by the States parties to the Court, despite the clear \r\nprovisions of the Rome Statute and the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court according to which the \r\ncost of referrals must be borne by the United Nations.\r\nThe fight against impunity is an objective of the \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute and also of the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, but that objective must \r\nbe accompanied by a commitment to provide the Court \r\nwith the necessary resources to carry out its functions. \r\nA lack of action in that regard could jeopardize the \r\nsustainability of the Court’s investigations and have an \r\nimpact on the credibility of the Organization. Likewise, \r\nwe believe that there is scope for a greater and better \r\nrelationship between the Court and the Security \r\nCouncil, especially regarding the work of the Council’s \r\nsubsidiary bodies such as the sanctions committees or \r\nthe Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict.\r\nFinally, Argentina wishes to emphasize that the \r\nsignificant contribution of the International Criminal \r\nCourt in the fight against impunity for the most \r\nserious international crimes is also a contribution to \r\nthe objectives of this Organization. We wish to recall \r\nthe noble mission and functions of the International \r\nCriminal Court in a multilateral system that aims to \r\npromote respect for human rights and achieve lasting \r\npeace in accordance with international law and the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. I take this opportunity to once again state \r\nArgentina’s firm commitment to the International \r\nCriminal Court.\r\nMr. Hawke (New Zealand): We thank President \r\nFernández de Gurmendi for her report (see A/72/349) \r\nand welcome the opportunity to discuss the \r\ncontribution of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nto international criminal justice and its relationship \r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nAs this will be her last report, we thank President \r\nFernández de Gurmendi for her contribution to \r\nthe ICC. Under her leadership, the Court has \r\nprioritized improving the transparency, efficiency \r\nand accountability of the institution. We welcome the \r\nprogress made in developing objectively measurable \r\nperformance indicators, and we hope that progress will \r\ncontinue under the leadership of the new ICC President. \r\nWe were also pleased to welcome President Fernández \r\nde Gurmendi to Auckland earlier this year and to see \r\nher at the Pacific Islands Forum, which was recently \r\nheld in Samoa.\r\nNew Zealand is a strong supporter of the ICC and \r\nits mandate to hold accountable those who commit the \r\nmost serious international crimes, regardless of where \r\nthey occur. For that reason, New Zealand remains a \r\nsupporter of the universality of the Rome Statute and \r\nthe principle of complementarity. Challenges to the \r\nuniversality of the Court go to its credibility and must \r\nbe taken seriously. New Zealand has consistently taken \r\nthe view that we must listen to one another’s views and \r\nconstructively debate concerns raised by all Member \r\nStates and address them to the extent possible while \r\npreserving the integrity of the Court.\r\nLast year, we saw some of the most significant \r\nchallenges to universality that the Court has \r\nexperienced to date. To overcome those challenges, we \r\nreaffirmed our commitment to meaningful dialogue \r\nwith the Court and among States parties. Constructive \r\ndialogue continued at the Assembly of States Parties \r\nunder the leadership of our President, His Excellency \r\nSidiki Kaba. We welcomed South Africa and The \r\nGambia’s decisions to remain as States parties. We \r\nfurther encourage Burundi to reconsider its withdrawal \r\nfrom the Rome Statute. We hope that with continued \r\nengagement, there remains a pathway back to full \r\nmembership of the Court.\r\nAlthough we are pleased that the Court has \r\nweathered those significant challenges, we must not \r\nbe complacent. New Zealand remains committed to \r\ncontinuing dialogue that is open, honest, respectful \r\nand focused on our common goal of ending \r\nimpunity. We recognize that achieving this goal will \r\ninclude cooperation at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels.\r\nNew Zealand recognizes the important role the \r\nSecurity Council can play in achieving accountability \r\nfor international crimes. New Zealand has consistently \r\nsaid that the Council should carefully consider the \r\nuse of its referral powers to avoid the perception that \r\nit is using referrals as a political tool in the midst of \r\na conflict. That only politicizes the Court and can \r\nprolong both conflict and impunity.\r\nWhen the Council decides to refer a situation to \r\nthe Court, it should do so with a clear commitment to \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 25/30\r\nfollow up and ensure that the Court receives support, \r\ncooperation and resources to implement Council \r\ndecisions. In that regard, we share the Court’s concern \r\nabout the lack of follow-up of Council referrals. Failure \r\nto take action calls into question the authority of the \r\nCouncil and its decisions. We reiterate that costs \r\nincurred by the ICC as a result of decisions by United \r\nNations organs should be attributed to, and accounted \r\nfrom, the United Nations budget, which is provided \r\nfor under the Rome Statute. We look forward to seeing \r\nprogress on this issue.\r\nThe Assembly of States Parties faces an important \r\nmilestone with respect to the crime of aggression. The \r\nsignificance of enabling the Court to hold political \r\nand military leaders accountable for initiating and \r\nengaging in an act of aggression cannot be understated. \r\nAccountability for the crime of aggression not only \r\ncomplements the prohibition on the illegal use of force \r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations by providing \r\nfor individual criminal responsibility, but is also one \r\nof the most significant developments in international \r\ncriminal law since the establishment of the International \r\nMilitary Tribunal at Nuremburg. As the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties prepares to bring the crime of aggression \r\namendments into force, New Zealand emphasizes the \r\nimportance of a consensus decision that supports the \r\nwider credibility of the Court.\r\nFor our part, New Zealand remains committed to \r\nthe Court and to working with others to ensure that the \r\nCourt continues to be, and is seen to be, an effective \r\nand sustainable judicial institution.\r\nMr. Locsin (Philippines): We thank President \r\nSilvia Fernández de Gurmendi for her comprehensive \r\nreport (see A/72/349).\r\nThe Philippines — a real democracy and a \r\nmulti-ethnic Christian majority and Muslim minority \r\nsociety that cherishes diversity in all aspects in a spirit \r\nof religious and political tolerance that has marked \r\nboth religions at their best, and whose core values are \r\nAmerican — once again reaffirms its commitment \r\nto justice and to fighting intolerance and impunity, \r\nensuring that perpetrators are held accountable for their \r\ncrimes. The Philippines remains strongly committed to \r\nupholding the rule of law and human rights.\r\nThe legacy of Nuremburg is that individuals can be \r\nmade accountable even if their acts were not statutory \r\ncrimes and even if Governments tolerated or even \r\nsanctioned those acts. Crimes against international law \r\nare committed by men, not by abstract entities, and \r\nonly by punishing individuals who commit such crimes \r\ncan the provisions of international law be enforced — a \r\nreaffirmation of man’s free will for good and evil.\r\nWithout Nuremburg, we have little hope and \r\ncommitment to saving ourselves and our children \r\nfrom the scourge of war, which twice in our founding \r\nfathers’ and mothers’ lifetimes brought untold sorrow \r\nto all humanity. Without Nuremberg, justice could \r\nnot have coped with the limitless ingenuity of evil \r\nmen in perpetrating acts that defied the imagination \r\nof lawmakers until they saw with horror those acts \r\ncommitted, from the Rape of Nanking to Auschwitz, \r\nfrom the killing fields of Biafra and Cambodia to \r\nBosnia and Rwanda, from the blood bath that created \r\nBangladesh to the torture centres of the Caliphate.\r\nIt is people individually, then collectively, who \r\nmake justice work. In the same way, they commit \r\ninjustices on a vast scale. There have been many \r\nheroes from Nuremberg to the establishment of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, the adoption of the Rome \r\nStatute in 1998 and the election of its first bench of \r\njudges in 2003. Those heroes — too many to name but \r\nnot enough to have prevented the outrages that they \r\nprosecuted and judged — range from lawyers and civil \r\nsociety advocates to witnesses and the victims.\r\nNo one is above the law. The Philippines joins \r\nprevious speakers in upholding and defending the \r\nRome Statute. To be sure, despite the creation of the \r\nCourt, one thing has not changed: the collective work of \r\ndelivering international justice remains a vocation that \r\nis difficult, thankless and even dangerous.\r\nChallenges remain. One of them is universality. \r\nThe Philippines joins the call for many more countries \r\nto ratify or accede to the Rome Statute. Whether or \r\nnot we are States parties, we should all protect human \r\nrights and build domestic capacities to enforce them \r\nand punish their violation. The Philippines once again \r\ncalls on the five permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil to refrain from using their veto in situations \r\npatently involving mass atrocity crimes, and to \r\ntake the necessary follow-up measures in situations \r\nreferred to the Court so as to uphold the credibility of \r\nboth institutions.\r\nIn the same spirit of genuine understanding, in \r\nadvance of the sixteenth Assembly of States Parties in \r\nDecember, the Philippines also supports full and candid \r\ndialogue and consultations to address allegations of \r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n26/30 17-35155\r\ninequality and unfairness in the work of the Court. \r\nJudges are only human, as the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights so eloquently said. Nonetheless, the \r\nwork that those judges do far, far outweighs the f laws \r\nof individuals that discredit the Court’s noble mission: \r\nto provide justice where otherwise none would be \r\npossible, to protect the weak whom none of the strong \r\nwill protect, and to vindicate their rights that have \r\nbeen trampled.\r\nIn that context, let me briefly mention the \r\nPhilippine campaign against illegal drugs, which pose \r\nan existential threat to my country. We were advised \r\nto tolerate a worsening drug situation, urged to live \r\nwith the threat it poses by avoiding strong measures to \r\ndefeat it, and to legalize drugs so as to make addiction a \r\nbenign condition. But legalizing such a crime does not \r\nmake it less of one. We refuse to do that. We cannot live \r\nwith what does not let our people live in peace, with \r\nwell-being, freedom and national security. Ever in the \r\nmind of every country in Asia is the subjugation of a \r\ngreat empire by two others f looding it with opium.\r\nWe remain resolute in combating the proliferation \r\nof drugs and the prevalence of drug addiction in our \r\ncountry. A whole-of-nation approach is needed to solve \r\nthat problem, and vigorous law enforcement is definitely \r\npart of it. As many in the Assembly now know, and \r\nthe United Nations has alerted us, there is an intimate \r\nand indisputable relationship between terrorism and the \r\nillegal drug trade. The siege of Marawi and what was \r\nfound there proves that conclusively.\r\nLet me reiterate our basic principles. The \r\nPhilippines is committed to upholding the rule of law \r\nand respecting human rights in the fight against illegal \r\ndrugs. We do not condone killings. It is tragic that many \r\ndeaths have taken place outside the framework of lawful \r\npolice operations. They are being investigated and \r\nprosecuted in the Philippines’ criminal justice system, \r\nas many of them were found to be rub-outs committed \r\nby unknown groups, perhaps taking advantage of the \r\nGovernment’s campaign.\r\nAccountability in the campaign is of overriding \r\nconcern to the President. He has ordered the internal \r\ncleansing of the entire police organization, relieved a \r\nmajor command and reassigned the campaign from the \r\nnational police to a specialized drug enforcement agency \r\nwith a long record of cooperation with its counterparts \r\nin the United States and Europe. Government critics \r\nnow object that the agency is too small to cope with \r\nthe drug problem. It is either too much or too little. One \r\ncannot please everybody. As a State party to the Rome \r\nStatute, the Philippines will cooperate in providing \r\nauthentic information and has invited the United \r\nNations to join it in that effort, with the exception of \r\npoliticized individuals with a personal stake in proving \r\nthemselves right no matter what.\r\nThe Court is one of last resort. The Philippines \r\nitself has a responsibility and a right to prosecute crimes \r\nunder the Rome Statute. We have a functioning criminal \r\njustice system capable of prosecuting those crimes. In \r\nthe spirit of the law, let us all show that complementarity \r\nworks, and that biased intervention — even if merely \r\nvocal — is not necessary.\r\nMr. Escalante Hasbún (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We would like to begin our statement by \r\nthanking the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, Her Excellency Ms. Silvia Fernández de \r\nGurmendi, for the presentation of her report (see \r\nA/72/349), in which she details the administrative \r\nand judicial activities carried out by the Court for the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2016 to 31 July, submitted to the \r\nGeneral Assembly in accordance with article 6 of the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court, and paragraph \r\n28 of resolution 71/253. We also thank Mexico for the \r\nintroduction of draft resolution A/72/L.3, which my \r\ncountry has the honour of co-sponsoring.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that last year the \r\nInternational Criminal Court continued to have a high \r\nvolume of work and that the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nis pursuing investigations in 10 situations. Moreover, \r\nwe are aware that the International Criminal Court has \r\nmade significant achievements in recent years, but we \r\nalso acknowledge that much remains to be done and that \r\nthe path before us is long, filled with challenges and \r\nopportunities to move forward in a process that opens \r\nthe door to judging serious violations of human rights, \r\nto the possibility of judging those who have committed \r\ncrimes defined in the Rome Statute, and, even more \r\nimportantly, to transforming the Court into an effective \r\ntool of deterrence for those crimes in the future.\r\nTherefore, our country supports the adoption by \r\nconsensus, at the upcoming Assembly of States Parties \r\nto the Rome Statute, to be held in this city in December, \r\nof a decision to activate jurisdiction over the crime of \r\naggression, which would reinforce the jurisdiction and \r\ncompetence of the International Criminal Court. That \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 27/30\r\nis part of a new commitment taken on last year when \r\nmy country deposited with the Secretary-General our \r\ninstrument of ratification of the Kampala amendment \r\non the crime of aggression and of the principles \r\nand values of the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court,\r\nLikewise, as part of our commitment to the \r\ninternational community and the Criminal Court itself, \r\nin order to strengthen the regulatory and operational \r\nstructure, last year we implemented internal processes, \r\nin accordance with our national legislation, to ratify as \r\nsoon as possible the Agreement on the Privileges and \r\nImmunities of the International Criminal Court, as \r\nwe firmly believe that that instrument will facilitate \r\nnot only the carrying out of its functions but also of \r\nits purposes.\r\nEl Salvador is one of the most recent countries \r\nto adhere to the Rome Statute and the Kampala \r\namendments, as the result of a long dialogue process \r\ninvolving various forces and actors of the country, \r\nthereby leading to a more concrete and realistic \r\nknowledge of the Court’s powers and competencies. \r\nWe believe that El Salvador represents a successful \r\nexample of the universalization of the Rome Statute, and \r\nas a country we will offer our experience to any State \r\nMember of the United Nations that has yet to deposit \r\nits ratification instrument in order to help overcome \r\nany erroneous juridical preconception concerning the \r\nCourt and the Statute.\r\nLastly, I would like to conclude my statement by \r\nreiterating our country’s  deep commitment to and \r\nsupport for the work of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. We urge once again those who have not done so \r\nto ratify the Rome Statute and its two amendments and \r\nto continue with the analysis with a view to achieving \r\nfull universality in the near future so as to promote \r\njustice and reduce impunity at the international level.\r\nMr. Lambertini (Italy): Italy welcomes the report \r\non the activities of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) (see A/72/349) and the opportunity to participate \r\nin today’s debate. Let me warmly thank the President \r\nof the Court, Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, for \r\nher presentation today and the work that she has done \r\nover her years as President of the Court. The report \r\nand the President’s address today show the continuing \r\nefforts of the Court, which is facing a heavy workload, \r\nto improve the effectiveness of its proceedings while \r\ncontinuing to meet the increasing demand for justice.\r\nItaly aligns itself with the statement delivered earlier \r\nby the observer of the European Union. I would like to \r\nemphasize only a few points in my national capacity.\r\nFirst of all, it is essential for States to respect the \r\nindependence of the Court. At the same time, it is our \r\nrole as State representatives to deal with all potential \r\nconcerns and tackle through dialogue at the political \r\nlevel all relevant issues.\r\nDuring the past three years in our role as \r\nVice-President of the Assembly of States Parties in New \r\nYork, we have been proud to work side by side with the \r\nPresident of that Assembly, the Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Senegal, Mr. Sidiki Kaba, in his efforts to \r\nimprove dialogue among States parties on important \r\nissues of common concern. The Assembly of States \r\nParties continues to be the proper forum to discuss a \r\nnumber of issues of common interest for States parties, \r\nand we have an important session in December.\r\nAt the same time, however, the fight against \r\nimpunity remains a common concern of the \r\ninternational community as a whole, not just of the \r\n123 States parties. Therefore, it is equally important \r\nto discuss accountability for war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity here at the United Nations, together \r\nwith all other Member States. Today’s debate provides \r\nus with a good opportunity to do so.\r\nThe Rome Statute is a cornerstone of the fight \r\nagainst impunity and the establishment of the age \r\nof accountability. On 17 July 2018, the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Statute will be \r\ncelebrated, and several events are in preparation \r\nto mark the anniversary. The importance of the \r\ntreaty, which created the first and only permanent \r\ninternational criminal tribunal, is evident. The ICC is a \r\nunique institution, and it is important to work together \r\nto further strengthen it.\r\nFollowing the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials after \r\nthe Second World War and the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations, it took more than 50 years for the \r\ninternational community to come together in Rome \r\nin 1998 and finalize this ambitious treaty, which was \r\ninspired by the fundamental principles of international \r\njustice. This treaty shares many of the essential goals \r\nof the United Nations and its Charter. Universal \r\nparticipation in the Rome Statute continues to be an \r\nobjective that we must pursue with an encouragement \r\nto all Member States to consider ratifying the Statute. \r\nHowever, we must not forget that the values enshrined \r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n28/30 17-35155\r\nin the Statute are already universal in character, and \r\nwe — all Member States — can and should engage in \r\nfurthering those values and promoting the goals of the \r\nfight against impunity.\r\nAt the same time, it is particularly important that \r\nthe international community increase its efforts in \r\nupholding the concept of complementarity and work \r\ntogether to strengthen domestic systems, as the ICC is \r\nand should remain a court of last resort. Our objective \r\nis to see stronger capacities at the national level to \r\nprosecute crimes and defend the interest of victims.\r\nOur focus must remain on the victims of international \r\ncrimes. Also for that reason, on 17 July — the date that \r\nwas proclaimed by the Kampala Review Conference \r\nin 2010 as the Day of International Criminal Justice \r\nworldwide — Italy, together with Denmark, The \r\nGambia and Liechtenstein, organized an event during \r\nwhich the Trust Fund for Victims highlighted the \r\ncrucial role it plays in providing redress and reparations, \r\nboth for individual victims and for the communities \r\nmost directly affected by such crimes. And the order \r\nof the Court of 17 August on reparations concerning \r\nthe destruction of cultural heritage in Timbuktu is an \r\nimportant confirmation of the continuing efforts in that \r\ndirection, which we welcome.\r\nMs. Sapag Muñoz de la Peña (Chile) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): First of all, we express our appreciation to \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court, \r\nthe Honourable Judge Silvia Alejandra Fernández \r\nde Gurmendi, for the complete report that she has \r\npresented on the period from 1 August 2016 to 31 July \r\n2017 (see A/72/349). The report shows, inter alia, the \r\nsignificant increase in the volume of work that the \r\nCourt has experienced.\r\nWe would also like to congratulate Judge Fernández \r\nde Gurmendi for her outstanding work as President of \r\nthe Court since March 2015. We greatly appreciate her \r\nefforts to increase the efficiency of the criminal process \r\nand actively promote the universality of the Rome \r\nStatute, especially under complex circumstances. We \r\nsee that the judicial and prosecutorial activities during \r\nthe reporting period, both in preliminary examinations \r\nand in investigations and procedures, have been widely \r\ndeveloped, thereby contributing to the fulfilment of the \r\nCourt’s mandate.\r\nThe International Criminal Court has become a \r\nunique expression of our time. It marks a unique stage \r\nin the history of institutions dedicated to international \r\ncriminal justice. From the point of view of the protection \r\nof human rights, the creation of the Criminal Court \r\ncontinues to be a decisive pillar in the fight against \r\nimpunity, and through it the States parties demonstrate \r\ntheir commitment to the international community with \r\nregard to compliance with its objectives.\r\nChile has actively and decisively supported the \r\nCourt since the beginning of the process that led to \r\nthe adoption of the Rome Statute. Looking back at the \r\nprogress made over the years, we are also aware that \r\nthere are various challenges facing the Court that require \r\nStates to continue working with unwavering energy.\r\nThe International Criminal Court could not carry \r\nout its decisive work in the fight against impunity \r\nwithout the due cooperation of States, so that those \r\nresponsible for crimes under the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt are held accountable for their actions. We call on \r\nall States to cooperate fully with it.\r\nThe cooperation of States is the main tool available \r\nto the Court for the execution of arrest warrants, \r\ndelivery of evidence and support for its investigations \r\nand procedures in general. The lack of cooperation by \r\nsome States can seriously affect its judicial functions \r\nand its ability to provide justice to victims. The Court \r\nmust have the means and the human and material \r\nresources necessary for the fulfilment of its mandate, \r\nand the States parties must responsibly study the \r\nbudgetary requirements, supporting the work of the \r\nrelevant bodies of the Assembly of States Parties. In \r\nthat connection, Chile reiterates that when the Security \r\nCouncil refers a case to the International Criminal \r\nCourt, it must also take the steps necessary to ensure \r\nthat it has the financial means to deal with that referral.\r\nWe are also convinced of the need for the Security \r\nCouncil to follow up on the cases that it refers and, \r\nin relation to those cases, to pay special attention to \r\nsituations that arise due to a lack of cooperation from \r\nStates or to the difficulties that could arise.\r\nRegarding the work of the Trust Fund for Victims, \r\nwe recognize its important work, which has allowed \r\nfor assistance to more than 455,000 victims to date. We \r\nshould not forget that support for victims is one of the \r\nfundamental reasons for acceding to the Rome Statute. \r\nWe will not rest until we meet our goal of achieving \r\nuniversality and the full application of the Rome \r\nStatute, and we call on States that are not yet parties to \r\nthe Statute to ratify or accede to it.\r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.36\r\n17-35155 29/30\r\nLast year, we learned of the withdrawal of three \r\nStates from the Rome Statute, which we deplore. We \r\nare therefore pleased to hear that two of them have \r\nrevoked those decisions. We urge all States that face \r\ndifficulties with respect to the application of certain \r\naspects of the Rome Statute to consider increasing the \r\neffectiveness of their provisions and to seek answers \r\nto their questions within the framework of its norms \r\nand principles.\r\nWe reiterate our faithful and determined support \r\nfor the International Criminal Court as an essential \r\ninstrument to fight impunity and prosecute the \r\nperpetrators of the most serious international crimes \r\nwhen the State does not or cannot act in favour of \r\njustice and support for victims.\r\nMr. Arriola Ramírez (Paraguay) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The Republic of Paraguay wishes to pay \r\ntribute to Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi in her \r\ncapacity as President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, as well as Mrs. Fatou Bensouda, Prosecutor \r\nof the International Criminal Court and all other \r\nmagistrates of this international tribunal. We welcome \r\nthe annual report of the Court on its activities between \r\n2016 and 2017 (see A/72/349).\r\nThe Republic of Paraguay, as a State based on the \r\nrule of law, recognizes and accepts international law, \r\nenshrining general principles such as international \r\nsolidarity and cooperation and the international \r\nprotection of human rights. Likewise, we condemn wars \r\nof aggression, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading \r\ntreatment or punishment. It should be noted that the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay declares genocide, the forced \r\ndisappearance of persons, abduction and homicide for \r\npolitical reasons as imprescriptible.\r\nI have the honour to share with the Assembly that \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay, true to its commitment to \r\ninternational law, is celebrating the fact that the just-\r\npromulgated law on national implementation of the \r\nRome Statute is fully in force. It includes, among \r\nother elements inherent in the provisions of that \r\ninstrument, genocide, crimes against humanity and \r\nwar crimes, in accordance with the Statute, as well as \r\ncommensurate punishment.\r\nIn addition to the jurisdiction exercised by the \r\nCourt over the aforementioned crimes, it will also \r\nbe exercised by national jurisdictional bodies in \r\naccordance with domestic criminal legislation. In that \r\nway, the relationship between universal jurisdiction and \r\nnational jurisdiction is established, with the limitations \r\nof the latter. Similarly, the Kampala amendments, \r\nwhich include the crime of aggression and broaden war \r\ncrimes, are under legislative treatment in the National \r\nCongress. Those important advances reaffirm and \r\nconsolidate the commitment of the Republic of Paraguay \r\nto promote the universality and full application of \r\nthe Rome Statute and further strengthen our ties and \r\ncooperation with the International Criminal Court.\r\nOn the other hand, the Republic of Paraguay \r\nurges the United Nations to continue strengthening its \r\nrelations with the Court, particularly with regard to \r\nthe exchange of information, the provision of services \r\nand facilities, judicial assistance and the appearance of \r\nUnited Nations personnel before the Court to provide \r\ntestimony and support for activities on the ground, as \r\nwell as strengthening cooperation with peacekeeping \r\nmissions, the Security Council and other bodies of \r\nthe Organization.\r\nLikewise, the Republic of Paraguay welcomes the \r\nwork, both in reparation and assistance, of the Trust \r\nFund for Victims, particularly in the provision of \r\nphysical and psychological rehabilitation services and \r\nmaterial support to survivors of crimes defined in the \r\nRome Statute. The Republic of Paraguay encourages the \r\nFund to continue those tireless activities for the victims \r\nand invites other States and interested entities to make \r\nnew contributions to extend and maintain the assistance \r\nprogrammes and to maintain and increase its financial \r\nreserves. That will complement the reparations granted \r\nby decision of the Court.\r\nThe Republic of Paraguay expresses its full support \r\nto the Court with regard to all forms of assistance it has \r\nrecently provided, especially in relation to the promotion \r\nof the universality of the Rome Statute system and the \r\nadoption of national legislation. As evidence of that \r\nsupport, my country’s delegation is co-sponsoring \r\nresolution A/72/L.3, which will be adopted today. \r\nWe also urge those States that have not yet done so to \r\naccede to the Rome Statute in its entirety, as we believe \r\nthat the only way to ensure the functioning of the Court \r\nis through the joint efforts of its States parties in the \r\ncollective fight against impunity for the perpetration of \r\nthe most serious international crimes.\r\nFinally, the Republic of Paraguay urges the Court \r\nto continue its hard work of exercising its jurisdiction \r\nover persons, as a permanent international judicial \r\norgan, for the commission of the most serious crimes of \r\nA/72/PV.36 30/10/2017\r\n30/30 17-35155\r\nconcern to the international community, as established \r\nin its Statute. We also encourage the magistrates of the \r\nCourt to continue their work in the most objective and \r\nimpartial way possible.\r\nMs. Boucher (Canada) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I would like to reiterate Canada’s continuing \r\nsupport for the International Criminal Court (ICC) and \r\nthe essential role it is playing in ensuring accountability \r\nfor those responsible for the commission of the most \r\nserious international crimes. A majority of Member \r\nStates are already parties to the Rome Statute of the \r\nICC. However, we remain some distance from achieving \r\nuniversality of the Statute. Canada calls upon those \r\nStates that have not yet done so to consider acceding to \r\nthe Rome Statute.\r\nIt is well known that the Court cannot effectively \r\naccomplish its mandate without the necessary \r\ncooperation from States parties and other actors. \r\nOver the past few years, we have witnessed both \r\naccomplishments and challenges in the sphere of \r\ninternational cooperation. The historic guilty plea and \r\nconviction of Mr. Al-Mahdi for war crimes related \r\nto the destruction of UNESCO-protected shrines in \r\nTimbuktu would not have been possible without the \r\nassistance of the Niger and Mali. We commend their \r\ncooperation as a concrete example of their commitment \r\nto justice.\r\nWith the support of States parties, the International \r\nCriminal Court has also made landmark judgments \r\ncondemning the recruitment of child soldiers and \r\nsexual and gender-based crimes. Despite such \r\naccomplishments, Canada remains troubled by instances \r\nof non-cooperation, particularly by State parties to the \r\nRome Statute. The fact that arrest warrants issued years \r\nago — including those issued pursuant to referral to the \r\nCourt by the Security Council — remain unexecuted \r\nshould be concerning to all of us as members of the \r\ninternational community. Canada encourages all States \r\nto abide by their international commitments.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nCanada welcomes The Gambia’s decision to remain \r\na party to the Rome Statute. We also welcome South \r\nAfrica’s reversal of its withdrawal and hope to see it \r\nremain a party to the Rome Statute. However, we \r\ncontinue to be concerned by the withdrawal of Burundi \r\nfrom the Court, and we urge Burundi to reconsider.\r\nAt the same time, Canada is encouraged by African \r\nvoices that have spoken out in support of the Court \r\nover the past year, including Botswana, Sierra Leone, \r\nNigeria, Tanzania, Ghana, Malawi and Senegal. All \r\nvictims, including African victims, have a right to \r\njustice. The ongoing contributions of African States \r\nin support of the Court are invaluable to making that \r\njustice a reality. African States played an important \r\nrole in both the establishment and development of the \r\nCourt. Today, their steadfast support is more important \r\nthan ever in the fight against impunity.\r\nAs Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in Rome in \r\n1998, the establishment of the Court was a gift of hope \r\nto future generations and that it was a giant step forward \r\nin the march towards universal human rights and the \r\nrule of law. Building on the legacy of Nuremberg, and \r\nfollowing the lead of the ad hoc tribunals for Rwanda \r\nand the former Yugoslavia, the ICC is the culmination \r\nof the international community’s dedication to \r\nfighting impunity and giving voice to the victims of \r\natrocity crimes.\r\nAs a recent example of Canada’s ongoing support \r\nfor the ICC, I am proud to note that we have nominated \r\nan exceptionally qualified candidate, Ms. Kimberly \r\nProst, for election as a Judge of the Court. That \r\nnomination resonates with the priority that Canada \r\nplaces on gender equality and women leadership.\r\nLooking forward, Canada anticipates that the \r\nupcoming sixteenth Assembly of States Parties will be \r\na fruitful meeting that allows us to move forward with \r\nstrengthening the Court’s role. We hope for productive \r\ndiscussions on activating the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nover the crime of aggression, and on budgetary and \r\ngovernance issues, while avoiding politicization and \r\nmicromanagement. We must continue to constructively \r\nwork together to achieve our common goal of \r\nmaintaining and strengthening the framework of a \r\npermanent, independent judicial institution that has the \r\nrespect and confidence of the international community.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
