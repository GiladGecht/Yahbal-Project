"United Nations A/72/PV.37\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n37th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 30 October 2017, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Perera \r\n(Sri Lanka), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 76 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Criminal Court\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/72/349)\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/72/342, \r\nA/72/372 and A/71/372/Corr.1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/72/L.3)\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): With \r\nregard to the matter under discussion, I would like to \r\nstate that combating impunity is inarguably a noble \r\nobjective as we strive to attain justice. We support \r\nthis intention and are working to achieve it within the \r\nframework of the United Nations. Achieving justice is \r\nthe primary responsibility of relevant national judicial \r\nbodies, in accordance with their domestic mandates \r\nand jurisdictions.\r\nWhile we are deliberating on the report (see \r\nA/72/349) of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nwe should like to recall that the relationship between \r\nthe United Nations and the ICC should take into \r\naccount the separate and independent nature of the two \r\nbodies and the absence of an organic or structural link \r\nbetween them. It is a source of great concern that some \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute are attempting to \r\nmake the General Assembly into a General Assembly \r\nfor the States Parties to the Rome Statute.\r\nIn rejecting this trend, which is made crystal-clear \r\nin the annual periodic draft resolution on the ICC report \r\n(A/72/L.3), my delegation is expressing its decisive and \r\nclear-cut opposition to it. Time and again, the draft \r\nresolution’s sponsors propose numerous new paragraphs \r\nto advance loose interpretations that do not reflect the \r\nletter and spirit of the Relationship Agreement, but \r\nrather improperly advance the distinct and transparent \r\nobjective of empowering a Court that claims to be \r\nindependent and characterized by the specificity of \r\nits jurisdiction.\r\nIn the light of a Statute that proposes a legal \r\nframework for the Court, we in the Sudan have constantly \r\nexpressed our position in the informal meetings on the \r\ndraft resolution on the report of the Court and will \r\ncontinue to do so. Furthermore, we call for abiding by \r\nthe scope and framework of the relations between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Court, with no expansion or \r\nexcessively broad interpretation of the relationship.\r\nThe relationship should therefore continue without \r\nany attempt by the Court to lay claim to universality. \r\nThe mandate of the United Nations, its agencies and \r\norgans is clear, and any attempt to deviate from it will \r\nsidetrack the Organization from its goals and modus \r\noperandi, while also seriously endangering it and its \r\nactivities, given the lack of consensus about the Court \r\nand the Rome Statute.\r\nThe relationship between the ICC and the Security \r\nCouncil is a f lagrant form of politicization of the Court’s \r\nwork. There should be no link between a judicial organ \r\nsupposedly meant to administer international justice \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n17-35526 (E)\r\n*1735526*\r\nA/72/PV.37 30/10/2017\r\n2/25 17-35526\r\nand a political organ that is influenced by political \r\ninterests, when it is that organ that refers certain \r\ncountries’ situations to the Court and spares other \r\ncountries from having to appear before the Court. This \r\nreflects the conflict between justice and the rule of law.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (A/72/342) should \r\nrespect the letter and the spirit of the Relationship \r\nAgreement without trying to integrate the International \r\nCriminal Court into the United Nations system. \r\nThis runs counter to the nature and the scope of the \r\nRelationship Agreement. We are concerned about the \r\nICC’s interference in the work of the Secretariat and \r\nthe Court’s attempts to direct Secretariat staff in their \r\ndealings with Member States, which merely expect \r\nreports from the Secretariat on respect for their rights.\r\nThe work of the Court and of the administrative \r\nsystem is not within the bounds of the law, which \r\nreflects the Court’s willingness to gain legitimacy \r\nby any possible means, which is a f lawed and weak \r\napproach, not only because of its contradictory Statute \r\nbut also owing to the corrupt and nepotistic practices \r\nat work within the Court. The Court is undermining \r\ninternational law as it is in breach of numerous \r\ninternational treaties, in particular the Vienna \r\nConvention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 and the \r\nVienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961. \r\nFurther, in terms of immunity, the Rome Statute runs \r\ncounter to international law. The fact that the Court \r\ndoes not have recourse to transitional justice, which \r\nviolates the principles of peace and reconciliation, is a \r\ncontradiction that in the end fuels wars and disputes in \r\nAfrica. The Statute’s articles give full authority to the \r\nProsecutor to preside over national prosecutions, and \r\nthe Prosecutor can withdraw the right to investigate. \r\nWe therefore have nothing to do with the Court and \r\ncall on all States to reconsider the Statute and the \r\ncontradictory practices to which it gives rise.\r\nThe report of the International Criminal Court \r\nbefore the Assembly today states that, since the Statute \r\ncame into force 15 years ago, the Court has considered \r\nonly 25 cases, of which only five have been completed. \r\nWe all wish to prevent heinous crimes and to combat \r\nimpunity, but at this rate, how can that be achieved? It \r\ncertainly cannot be done through the politicization of \r\njustice and the use of double standards.\r\nI would like to add that the Court’s foremost f law \r\nis how it has paved the way for voluntary contributions \r\nto its budget. Donations, including from civil-society \r\norganizations and individuals, fund the majority of \r\nthe Court’s budget today, and it is well known that \r\nthe European Union (EU) underwrites the lion’s share \r\nthereof. Now, when the observer of the European Union \r\nrefers only to African States in the examples from the \r\nCourt he cites (see A/72/PV.36), is that a coincidence? \r\nThat is the question. For us, it is clearly not a coincidence. \r\nOtherwise, the EU observer would have also mentioned \r\ncases of States before the Court pursuant to sub-articles \r\n(a) and (c) of article 13 of the Rome Statute, and not \r\njust those referred to the Court by the Security Council \r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter, as he did. In addition, \r\nthe States whose situations have been referred to the \r\nICC are both African States. I need not say more.\r\nWe know that the Court was founded mainly to \r\nrespond to humankind’s suffering resulting from the \r\ncrime of aggression — the worst international crime. \r\nThe suffering that led directly to the establishment of \r\nthe Court, as some speakers before me have mentioned, \r\nwas first addressed in 1947, two years after the end \r\nof the Second World War and its tragedies, which \r\nwere unprecedented in human history, at which time \r\nthe General Assembly agreed in principle to develop \r\na system of international justice. Our issue is not to \r\nrespond to it politically or diplomatically but as a matter \r\nof conscience. The question is whether we will one day \r\nsee the Prosecutor of the ICC agree to investigate one \r\nof the States mentioned by the EU this morning. Will \r\nthe Security Council one day refer a case to the ICC \r\nwithout recourse to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute? \r\nThis is the ethical and legal question to which we need \r\na response.\r\nMr. Giacomelli Da Silva (Brazil) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, I would like to thank the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for its report to the \r\nGeneral Assembly (see A/72/349) and congratulate it \r\non its contribution to the fight against impunity and for \r\npromoting respect for the rule of law. I also join speakers \r\nbefore me in expressing my thanks to the President \r\nof the ICC, Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, for \r\npresenting the report and for her efforts aimed at making \r\nthe Court a more effective institution. As this is her last \r\ntime participating in the work of the General Assembly \r\nin that capacity, Brazil takes this opportunity to thank \r\nher for her long-standing commitment to the causes of \r\nhuman rights and international criminal justice.\r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.37\r\n17-35526 3/25\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAs a proud founder of the ICC, Brazil is pleased \r\nto see that the Court continues to gain strength as the \r\nfirst permanent tribunal established to help to end \r\nimpunity for the most serious international crimes. As \r\nan instrument for ensuring that those accused before it \r\nare judged with fairness and full respect for their rights, \r\nthe ICC is a vehicle for justice and peace.\r\nI am pleased to recall not only that all South American \r\ncountries are parties to the Rome Statute but also that \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States represent the \r\nsecond-largest regional group among States parties, the \r\nfirst being the Group of African States. It is important \r\nto stress that any misperception of bias or selectivity \r\nin the Court’s activity will be definitively dispelled \r\nonly by advancing the universality of the Rome Statute, \r\nthereby expanding the Court’s room to operate. This is \r\nparticularly relevant when one considers that, so far, \r\na number of important international actors are not yet \r\nparties to the Statute.\r\nAs for the outcomes of the 2010 Kampala Review \r\nConference, the activation of the amendments regarding \r\nthe crime of aggression in 2017 will represent a major \r\ncontribution to completing the international criminal \r\njustice system. It will give additional meaning to the \r\nprohibition of the use of force, thereby fostering a more \r\nstable, just and democratic world order.\r\nThe workload of the Court continues to increase \r\nsignificantly. In this context, I recall my delegation’s \r\nconcern regarding the financing of Security Council \r\nreferrals. This issue is structural in nature and lies at \r\nthe very core of the relationship between the Court and \r\nthe United Nations, particularly the General Assembly.\r\nOnce again, we reiterate our call for implementation \r\nof article 13 of the Relationship Agreement and of article \r\n115 (b) of the Rome Statute, which provide guidance \r\nin the sense that such costs should be met — at least \r\npartially — by funds provided by the United Nations \r\nand not fall solely upon the parties to the Rome Statute. \r\nIt is equally important to highlight that, as laid out in \r\nArticle 17 of the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nGeneral Assembly has the exclusive responsibility to \r\nconsider and approve the budget of the Organization. \r\nThe proper funding of Security Council referrals would \r\nenhance the credibility of both the Court and the United \r\nNations. To date, the budget allocated for the Court in \r\nrelation to these referrals amount to approximately \r\n€58 million, but the current situation is neither fair \r\nnor sustainable.\r\nThe report of the International Criminal Court \r\ncontains a number of recommendations aimed at \r\nimproving the relationship between the Security \r\nCouncil and the Court. Brazil concurs with the \r\nassessment that a more structured dialogue between \r\nthem on issues of mutual interest — both thematic and \r\nsituation-specific — would be beneficial. Through its \r\njurisprudence, the Court has accumulated significant \r\nknowledge on issues such as children and armed \r\nconflict, women and peace and security, and the \r\nprotection of cultural property.\r\nCooperation between the Security Council sanctions \r\ncommittees could also be improved, especially with \r\nregard to travel bans and the freezing of assets. Brazil \r\nalso notes that certain United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations have been providing the Court with much-\r\nneeded support in the field, always in accordance with \r\ntheir mandate and basic principles.\r\nBrazil notes with appreciation that providing \r\njustice for victims remains an essential component \r\nof the daily work of the Court. We welcome the \r\nreparations procedures that are ongoing in different \r\ncases and the fact that the Trust Fund for Victims has \r\nassisted more than 450,000 persons with physical and \r\npsychological rehabilitation as well as with material \r\nsupport. We commend efforts to enhance the protection \r\nof witnesses, including through relocation agreements, \r\nand we stress the positive role of cooperation through \r\nstrengthening national capacities.\r\nThe quest for peace and justice is always \r\nchallenging, and this challenge is inherent to the search \r\nfor a more just and cooperative world order. Let us not \r\nfall into the trap of operating with false dichotomies \r\nthat seem to oppose peace to justice and sovereignty to \r\naccountability. We should instead focus on the shared \r\nvalues that bring the General Assembly together and \r\nwhich have made the first permanent, treaty-based \r\nInternational Criminal Court a reality. Brazil remains \r\nfirm in its commitment to the Rome Statute and the \r\ncause of justice that motivated its creation.\r\nMs. Krasa (Cyprus): It is a privilege to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered by the observer of the European \r\nUnion (see A/72/PV.36) and would like to deliver some \r\nadditional remarks.\r\nA/72/PV.37 30/10/2017\r\n4/25 17-35526\r\nIt is our strong conviction that the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) contributes greatly to the overall \r\ngoal of the United Nations of working towards a more \r\npeaceful and just world, thereby serving the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nCourt continues to rely on the indispensable support of \r\nthe United Nations and of individual Member States. \r\nAs foreseen by the architects of the Rome Statute \r\nsystem, such support is crucial to its ability to fulfil \r\nits mandate. In this respect, we support the further \r\nstrengthening of the relationship between the United \r\nNations and the Court in order to adjust to new and \r\nemerging common challenges.\r\nWe warmly thank President Fernández de \r\nGurmendi for presenting the report of the Court (see \r\nA/72/349). As the report reflects, the Court had yet \r\nanother full year in terms of judicial proceedings, \r\ninvestigations, preliminary examinations and \r\ninstitutional developments. We welcome the significant \r\nprogress made with regard to reparations for victims.\r\nWe are especially pleased to note that the \r\nGovernments of the Gambia and South Africa have \r\nrescinded their notifications of withdrawal, and we \r\nregret that the withdrawal of Burundi has come into \r\neffect. We are further pleased to note that Argentina, \r\nChile, the Netherlands and Portugal notified their \r\nconsent to be bound by the amendments on the crime \r\nof aggression. We look forward to the next Assembly \r\nof States Parties for the Court’s jurisdiction over the \r\ncrime of aggression to be activated, in accordance with \r\nthe consensus decision reached at the Kampala Review \r\nConference, thereby fully realizing the Rome Statute as \r\noriginally drafted.\r\nCyprus is pleased to have served from October \r\n2013 until the end of 2016 as a focal point for the \r\npromotion of universality of the Rome Statute. It \r\nremains committed to the collective responsibility of \r\nall State parties towards this end. We firmly believe \r\nthat universal ratification is the only way to effectively \r\naddress jurisdictional gaps and other current challenges \r\nand shortcomings. We would take this opportunity to \r\ncall upon all States not yet parties to the Rome Statute \r\nto ratify it. Within this framework, in July, our Foreign \r\nMinister joined the President of the Assembly of States \r\nParties and other Foreign Ministers in a video campaign \r\npromoting ratification.\r\nCyprus appreciates the Court’s important mandate \r\nin ensuring accountability for the war crime of the \r\ndestruction of cultural property. The protection of \r\ncultural heritage was one of the priorities of our \r\nrecent chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers \r\nof the Council of Europe, which culminated in the \r\nconclusion of the Nicosia Convention on Offences \r\nrelated to Cultural Property, which was opened for \r\nsignature in May. The Office of the Prosecutor of the \r\nICC participated in two events that took place under \r\nthe auspices of the Cyprus chairmanship, in Strasbourg \r\nand New York in January and February, respectively, \r\nand which focused on strengthening the international \r\nlegal framework for the protection of cultural heritage. \r\nMoreover, our Permanent Mission in New York is \r\ncurrently preparing the launch of an informal group \r\nof friends for cultural-heritage protection, which \r\nwill take a multifaceted approach thereto, including \r\nusing the international criminal justice angle, by \r\nsupporting existing initiatives, resolutions and \r\nrelevant organizations.\r\nIn closing, my delegation would like to reiterate \r\nits commitment to and unequivocal support for the \r\nCourt. At the same time, we express our readiness to \r\nengage in a constructive dialogue with States parties \r\nand States non-parties alike. We remain committed to \r\nthe consolidation and reinforcement of international \r\ncriminal justice and are pleased that the Court \r\nfully recognizes its own responsibility in terms of \r\ncontinuously improving its operations and increasing \r\nits efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nMr. García Reyes (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nGuatemala thanks the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court for the annual report of the Court \r\non its activities in 2016 and 2017 (see A/72/349). We \r\nalso welcome the publication by the United Nations of \r\nthe manual of best practices for cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the International Criminal \r\nCourt, which has contributed to further strengthening \r\ncooperation between the two institutions. We cannot \r\nmiss this opportunity to thank and congratulate Judge \r\nFernández de Gurmendi for her years of dedication to \r\nthe Criminal Court.\r\nWe know that the support and cooperation of the \r\nsenior management of the United Nations regarding \r\nthe Court are of the utmost importance, as is the active \r\nparticipation of the current Secretary-General and his \r\nteam. We hope that such cooperation is maintained, \r\nsince it is through that type of actions that the work \r\nof the Court can be strengthened and demonstrate its \r\ncrucial performance at the international level.\r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.37\r\n17-35526 5/25\r\nWe have noted and welcomed the information \r\naccording to which the Court continues to explore \r\nopportunities to increase its working collaboration \r\nwith its main United Nations partners, through, inter \r\nalia, regular round-table meetings between the United \r\nNations and the Court to discuss practical cooperation \r\narrangements, best practices, lessons learned and \r\nnew challenges. For that reason, my delegation awaits \r\nwith interest the next meeting, expected to take place \r\nthis December.\r\nLet me recall that in October 2012, when \r\nGuatemala assumed the presidency of the Security \r\nCouncil, it convened an open debate (see S/PV.6849), \r\nconsidering that structured dialogue between the Court \r\nand the Council on issues of common interest, as well \r\nas on issues regarding specific situations, could and \r\ncan improve compliance with the obligations created \r\nthrough the referrals by the Council and contribute to \r\nthe fight against impunity.\r\nWe know that the Court and the Security Council \r\nhave different functions, but we consider them \r\ncomplementary with regard to addressing the most \r\nserious crimes of concern to the entire international \r\ncommunity, as outlined in the Rome Statute. Therefore, \r\nwe believe that it is necessary to increase cooperation \r\nbetween the Court and the Security Council in order \r\nto unite efforts and contribute to the prevention of \r\nsuch crimes, which undermine peace and security. \r\nAdditionally, it is necessary to encourage efforts to \r\ncombat impunity for such crimes. We believe that it is \r\nopportune to maintain periodic exchanges between the \r\nCouncil and the Court, independently of the informative \r\nmeetings on the referred situations.\r\nCooperation is one of the fundamental pillars \r\non which the proper functioning of the Court rests. \r\nTherefore, the firm commitment of States parties is \r\ncrucial for increasing the capacity of the Court so as to \r\nensure accountability for crimes commited, bring about \r\njustice and provide reparations to victims, as well as to \r\nhelp prevent future crimes of this sort, in accordance \r\nwith the spirit of the Rome Statute.\r\nIn order to better adapt to the new challenges \r\nfacing the United Nations and the Court, the States \r\nparties to the Rome Statute and the membership of \r\nthe United Nations should strive to strengthen their \r\ncooperation and continually reaffirm the relevance and \r\nimportance of international criminal justice in order to \r\nensure the rule of law and maintain international peace \r\nand security.\r\nIn that vein, we cannot forget to mention the \r\nimportant draft resolution contained in document \r\nA/72/L.3, which the General Assembly will vote \r\non today, and which my delegation co-sponsored. It \r\nhighlights that the International Criminal Court is an \r\nindependent permanent judicial institution, which, \r\nby the adoption of its Statute, has a unique historical \r\nsignificance. Having said that, we call upon the United \r\nNations membership to approve the draft resolution, \r\nsince it promotes the vital role that the Organization \r\nplays in international peace and justice, and thus to \r\nagain cooperate with the International Criminal Court.\r\nMr. Jürgenson (Estonia): Estonia aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the observer of the European \r\nUnion (see A/72/PV.36)\r\nWe thank President Fernández de Gurmendi for \r\nher report (see A/72/349) and her ongoing service to \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC). We welcome \r\nthe opportunity for continued dialogue to discuss \r\nthe contributions of the Court and the international \r\ncommunity to international criminal justice. It is in \r\nour common interests to identify challenges, reflect on \r\npossible solutions and find practical ways to advance \r\naccountability for the most serious crimes committed.\r\nWe note the steady increase in the Court’s \r\nworkload. The Court is currently dealing with more \r\ncases and situations than ever, covering now most of \r\nthe regions of the world. We acknowledge the Court’s \r\nfirst decision to authorize an investigation of crimes \r\nin Europe, specifically in Georgia, demonstrating \r\nthat no perpetrator can expect impunity for the most \r\nserious international crimes, regardless of where they \r\noccur. The increasing number of cases and situations \r\nalso demonstrates that many States entrust their hopes \r\nfor justice and accountability to the Court. That is \r\ntestimony to the good work that the Court has done.\r\nWe note the important judicial developments that we \r\nhave seen in the past year. We acknowledge specifically \r\nthe judgment in the case of Bemba et al., concerning the \r\nsituation in the Central African Republic, and the start \r\nof the trial in the case of Dominic Ongwen. Those cases \r\nimportantly express the Court’s intolerance towards \r\nsexual violence as a tactic of war and its commitment to \r\nhold accountable those committing those acts. We also \r\nacknowledge the Court’s first conviction for crimes \r\nrelated to the destruction of cultural heritage and the \r\nA/72/PV.37 30/10/2017\r\n6/25 17-35526\r\nfirst conviction for offences against the administration \r\nof justice relating to witness tampering.\r\nHowever, the increasing workload also creates \r\nchallenges for the Court to remain efficient and \r\neffective. Therefore, we encourage the Court to further \r\nstreamline its administrative and judicial processes \r\nand make more efficient use of its resources. We \r\nalso encourage the Court to continue exploring the \r\npossibilities of using new technologies and developing \r\nand implementing meaningful performance indicators \r\nin order to improve efficiency.\r\nIn order for the Court to perform its mandate \r\nefficiently, effective national and Security Council \r\ncooperation is crucial. We note with concern that \r\narrest warrants are outstanding for 15 individuals and \r\nthat last year the Court again had to deliver decisions \r\nfinding failure by a State to comply with its obligations \r\nto cooperate with the Court. It is regrettable that since \r\n2009, Omar Al-Bashir has still not been arrested and \r\nsurrendered to the Court. We call upon all States and \r\nthe Security Council to take appropriate action to fully \r\ncooperate with the Court and bring those perpetrators \r\nto justice in order to end impunity.\r\nThe ICC is the only permanent international court \r\nestablished in order to put an end to impunity for the \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern, and thus to contribute to the prevention of \r\nsuch crimes as well as to the progressive development \r\nof international criminal law. Now, as we reach the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the Court, it is high time to \r\nmake full use of the international justice that the Rome \r\nStatute offers.\r\nThe international community already agreed, in \r\n1998, that the Court should also have jurisdiction over \r\nthe crime of aggression. With 34 States parties already \r\nhaving ratified the Kampala amendments on the crime \r\nof aggression, we look forward to a decision to activate \r\nthe relevant Court jurisdiction during the sixteenth \r\nsession of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome \r\nStatute, to be held here in New York in December. \r\nWhile acknowledging the different interpretations of \r\nsome legal provisions, we should not forget the main \r\nmessage that civilized countries have agreed upon, \r\nnamely, that aggression is never acceptable. We should \r\nhave confidence in international law and its fair and \r\nimpartial application by the ICC.\r\nEstonia is a long-standing supporter of the ICC. \r\nWe consider that the fight against impunity for the \r\nmost serious crimes is critical to ensure a fair and \r\njust society, by holding perpetrators accountable and \r\nensuring justice for victims. The existence of the ICC \r\nis a clear message that the crimes specified in the Rome \r\nStatute will not be tolerated and will not go unpunished.\r\nMrs. Carnal (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nPreventing wars and safeguarding peace are the \r\nforemost objectives of the United Nations. The \r\nCharter stipulates that Members shall refrain in their \r\ninternational relations from the threat or use of force. \r\nThat provision is one of the most fundamental rules of \r\nthe international legal order, yet it has proved difficult \r\nto translate those words into action. Armed conflicts \r\nbetween States remain a sad reality.\r\nThis year States parties to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) have an opportunity \r\nto strengthen the application of the prohibition of the \r\nuse of force. At the upcoming session of the Assembly \r\nof States Parties they will decide on the activation of \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction on the crime of aggression. \r\nThat crime covers acts of aggression that amount to a \r\nmanifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nPunishing that crime could contribute to avoiding and \r\nsanctioning extreme forms of wars of aggression.\r\nThe activation of the jurisdiction of the Court is in \r\nthe core interest of the United Nations and its Member \r\nStates. The Security Council will have an additional \r\ninstrument in its toolbox. It will be able to demand that \r\nan aggressor back down, or else refer the situation to the \r\nICC. States would benefit from enhanced protection, \r\nas aggressive leaders would fear prosecution and \r\npunishment for acts of aggression.\r\nThe definition of the crime of aggression has been \r\ndiscussed for decades. In 2010 in Kampala, States parties \r\nto the Rome Statute reached a clear compromise and \r\nadopted it by consensus. It would be a mistake to bring \r\nthat compromise into question now. Rather, more than \r\n70 years after the judgments delivered at Nuremberg \r\nand Tokyo, it is high time to make acts of aggression a \r\npunishable crime. Switzerland therefore calls upon all \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute to support the simple \r\nactivation of the jurisdiction, in accordance with the \r\nconsensual outcome reached in Kampala.\r\nEarlier this year, the Secretary-General highlighted \r\nthat the ICC and the United Nations both strive to \r\nmaintain international peace and security and to ensure \r\nthat the rule of law prevails. Indeed, the Court makes it \r\npossible to pursue a broad set of objectives of the United \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.37\r\n17-35526 7/25\r\nNations and its Member States. That holds particularly \r\ntrue for Sustainable Development Goal 16. Given its \r\ndeterrent effect and ability to deal with the past, the \r\nICC complements the work of national judicial systems \r\nand actors in the rule of law at the international level. \r\nSwitzerland therefore welcomes the fact that the Court \r\nworks closely with States and the United Nations, as \r\nshown in this year’s report of the Court (see A/72/349).\r\nRegrettably, atrocity crimes are often committed \r\noutside the jurisdiction of the ICC. The inability of the \r\nCourt to act in such situations is a stark reminder of \r\nthe need to continue promoting the universality of the \r\nRome Statute. Switzerland strongly regrets Burundi’s \r\nwithdrawal from the Statute and encourages the \r\nGovernment to reconsider that decision. In contrast, \r\nwe welcome the decisions of South Africa and the \r\nGambia to remain States parties. Switzerland calls on \r\nall States that have not yet done so to join the Rome \r\nStatute. Only a universal International Criminal Court \r\ncan act as a safety net to ensure justice for victims all \r\nover the world.\r\nMs. Carrión (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nUruguay expresses its gratitude for the excellent report \r\nof the International Criminal Court (see A/72/349), \r\nas well as to its President, Ms. Silvia Fernández de \r\nGurmendi, for the clarity with which she presented it \r\n(see A/72/PV.36). It is important to note that the Court \r\nreceived 4,725 applications during the reporting period.\r\nThe Court represents a milestone in the \r\ninternational community’s fight against impunity and \r\nthe commission of the most serious crimes against \r\nhumankind and the integrity and rights of persons. The \r\ndevelopment of international awareness of the need to \r\nend atrocities against human beings, both individuals \r\nand groups, and to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity were the reason for the establishment of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Abuses and acts of \r\nviolence, failure to respect international humanitarian \r\nlaw, slavery and many other atrocity crimes must cease, \r\nand the International Criminal Court, through its latent \r\njudgment, exercises a certain degree of control over \r\nthose crimes.\r\nThe importance of the Court’s establishment and \r\nthe mission for which it is responsible leads us to \r\nsupport all actions that would improve its management. \r\nIn that regard, we remind States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute of the need to cooperate with the Court so as \r\nto enable it to perform its duties. Furthermore, we urge \r\nStates to become parties to the Statute by ratifying it \r\nand its amendments.\r\nUruguay is convinced that cooperation among \r\nStates and with the Court is fundamental for the \r\nfulfilment of the Court’s objectives and for it to be able \r\nto put an end to impunity for those who commit the \r\nheinous acts classified in the Statute of the Court.\r\nUruguay recognizes the efforts the Court is \r\nundertaking, as set out by its President, to improve its \r\nprocedures and performance. The Court, having been \r\nestablished only a short time ago, requires the full \r\ncooperation of States in its proceedings going forward, \r\nincluding through cooperation, the provision of \r\ninformation, compliance with the measures requested, \r\ninsight and support for the conduct and completion \r\nof proceedings.\r\nWe need to bear in mind the work, independence \r\nand impartiality of the judges and of the Court as a \r\nwhole. We must also remember that the Court plays a \r\nrole subsidiary and complementary to that of national \r\njurisdictions. In that regard, States are responsible \r\nfor implementing the law and assuming the primary \r\njurisdiction that is theirs. The Statute clearly sets \r\nout that the Court may not act while proceedings are \r\nunder way in the territory of a State party, suspending \r\nits activity in such cases. The Rome Conference, in \r\nadopting the Statute and in establishing and defining \r\nthe crimes to which it would apply, helped codify the \r\ndevelopment of international law, which has led, and \r\nshould continue to lead, States to incorporate those \r\nnorms in their respective legislations.\r\nFor Uruguay, the fight against crimes against \r\nhumankind, war crimes, genocide and aggression is \r\nof the utmost importance. We therefore also consider \r\nimportant the activation of the Court’s jurisdiction over \r\nthe crime of aggression. We would like to reiterate that \r\naccountability for the commission of such grave crimes, \r\nno matter who committed them, must continue to be \r\na priority objective for the international community. \r\nStrengthening the work of the Court is therefore \r\nessential. In that connection, I would like to remind the \r\nAssembly that Uruguay, in its support for the work of \r\nthe Court, has put forward an excellent candidate for \r\njudge in Ms. Ariela Peralta.\r\nMr. Kyslytsya (Ukraine): Ukraine aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union (see A/72/PV.36). We would like to \r\nadd a few remarks in our national capacity.\r\nA/72/PV.37 30/10/2017\r\n8/25 17-35526\r\nWe welcome the presentation by President Fernández \r\nde Gurmendi (see A/72/PV.36), and we support the \r\nactivities of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nwhich has proved its efficiency by promoting the rule \r\nof law and putting an end to impunity for perpetrators \r\nof the most serious crimes.\r\nFollowing our decision to accept the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court, we cooperate closely with the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor, whose representatives visited Ukraine \r\ntwice during the reporting period. We commend the \r\ncontinuation of the examination of the situation in \r\nUkraine by the ICC. We particularly appreciate the \r\npreliminary conclusions by the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nstating that the international armed conflict between \r\nUkraine and the Russian Federation began when Russia \r\ndeployed its armed forces in parts of the Ukrainian \r\nterritory and that the law of international armed conflict \r\ncontinues to apply to the ongoing state of occupation.\r\nWith regard to eastern Ukraine, the Office is \r\nundertaking a detailed factual and legal analysis of \r\nthe Russian authorities’ ongoing support for the illegal \r\narmed groups. Such support includes equipment, \r\nfinancing and personnel, as well as general direction \r\nin planning the actions of the illegal armed groups in \r\na manner that indicates exercise of genuine control \r\nover them. Apparently it is due to this that the Russian \r\nFederation decided not to become a party to the Rome \r\nStatute, which it had previously signed.\r\nIn that connection, we would like to recall that \r\nthe temporarily occupied territory of the Autonomous \r\nRepublic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol by the \r\nRussian Federation, recognized by resolution 71/205, \r\nand Russia’s illegal actions in Donbas represent acts of \r\naggression. We welcome the ratification of the Kampala \r\namendments on the crime of aggression by 34 States \r\nparties. We look forward to a decision of the Assembly \r\nof States Parties to activate the Court’s jurisdiction in \r\nthis matter in the coming months.\r\nWhile recognizing the importance of the promotion \r\nof universal participation in the Rome Statute, we support \r\nall efforts aimed at raising awareness and understanding \r\nof the functioning of the Court. Moreover, in order to \r\nensure the universality of the Court’s jurisdiction, we \r\nneed to promote close cooperation by States as a direct \r\nresponse to crimes under the Rome Statute.\r\nWe know how difficult it is to bring those \r\nresponsible for the most serious crimes to justice, owing \r\nto a lack of cooperation with the ICC. In that regard, \r\nwe are convinced that the international community \r\nmust enhance its support to ICC efforts to combat \r\nimpunity and ensure the right to justice for all victims \r\nof such crimes.\r\nUkraine actively participated in the Preparatory \r\nCommittee on the Establishment of an International \r\nCriminal Court. In 2000, Ukraine signed the Rome \r\nStatute, and my country was the first State not party \r\nto ratify the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities \r\nof the International Criminal Court. The Ukrainian \r\nParliament’s adoption of a constitutional amendment \r\nlast year paved the way for the ratification of the Rome \r\nStatute. All of the relevant State authorities are actively \r\ninvolved in developing implementing legislation to \r\nthat end.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize again the \r\nimportance of cooperation by States that are not parties \r\nto the Rome Statute, the United Nations and other \r\ninternational and regional stakeholders with the ICC to \r\nenable it to carry out its activities.\r\nFinally, yet importantly, Ukraine, as in previous \r\nyears, co-sponsored a draft resolution (A/72/L.3) \r\nprepared and introduced by Mexico this morning (see \r\nA/72/PV.36). We believe that its adoption by consensus \r\nwill demonstrate our common strong support for the \r\nICC and our determination to fight against impunity \r\nand thereby contribute to the prevention of the most \r\nserious crimes.\r\nMr. Ly (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would like \r\nto warmly thank Ms. Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court, for her \r\nleadership at the head of the Court and for presenting \r\nthe report on its work (see A/72/349). Under her \r\npresidency, the Court will have made enormous \r\nprogress in streamlining its work and improving the \r\neffectiveness of that work. As she presents her final \r\nreport as President of the Court, she can be proud \r\nof the great work she has accomplished with great \r\nrigour, professionalism, independence and courtesy \r\nthroughout the years. She has the eternal gratitude of \r\nStates parties, victims and the whole of humankind. I \r\nwould also like to pay tribute to all those who, within \r\nthe Court and elsewhere, commit themselves on a daily \r\nbasis to ensuring that victims of mass crimes have \r\nthe right to justice. Senegal remains convinced that a \r\nworld of peace and stability means justice for all and \r\nreiterates its commitment to work with all stakeholders \r\nto that end.\r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.37\r\n17-35526 9/25\r\nThe consideration of the report of the International \r\nCriminal Court today reflects the importance of that \r\ninstitution in the global fight against impunity and in \r\nrespect for the rule of law. The work of the Court during \r\nthe period under consideration does indeed show that \r\nthe first and only permanent international court in \r\ncharge of prosecuting mass crimes makes a significant \r\ncontribution to delivering justice to millions of victims \r\naround the world and has given affected populations the \r\nfeeling that all of humankind has heard their cries.\r\nThere can be no more eloquent testimony than the \r\nrecord of 25 cases that have come before the Court \r\nto date. The Office of the Prosecutor has conducted \r\n10 preliminary examinations all over the world, in \r\naddition to the active phase of reparations undertaken \r\nby the Trust Fund for Victims. All that leads me to say \r\nthat, slowly but surely and irreversibly, the universality \r\nof international criminal justice is making progress. \r\nSenegal invites all States to provide the necessary \r\nassistance and cooperation to the Court so that it can \r\ncontinue to fulfil its mandate in an optimal manner.\r\nOn 8 December 2014, three years ago, at the time \r\nof his election as President of the Assembly of States \r\nParties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, Mr. Sidiki Kaba — then Minister for Justice, now \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Senegal — called for \r\nus to rise to the challenge of cooperation, universality, \r\ncomplementarity and strengthening relations among \r\nStates parties. Actions and steps forward have been \r\ntaken in that direction, but we must admit that we \r\nhave many challenges yet to overcome. Nonetheless, \r\nby demonstrating our resolve and determination in \r\ncombining our efforts, we can arrive at our goal.\r\nTogether we will work towards ever-closer cross-\r\ncutting, multilateral and multifaceted cooperation that \r\nis constantly being strengthened to win the fight against \r\nimpunity and build a more peaceful, prosperous and \r\nfairer world. Together, we will work for the universal \r\nratification of the Rome Statute and for the integration \r\nof those norms into the domestic law of States so that \r\nall victims throughout the world, wherever they live, \r\nhave an equal and fair chance of obtaining justice. \r\nTogether, we will work towards complementarity by \r\nstrengthening national judicial systems so that they \r\ncan judge even the most serious crimes that strike \r\nour collective conscience, to ensure that peace reigns. \r\nTogether, we will work to breathe new momentum \r\ninto the relations between the Court and all regions \r\nof the world, particularly Africa, through a frank and \r\nconstructive dialogue in the Assembly of States Parties.\r\nAs the great philosopher Kierkegaard said, “It is \r\nnot the path which is the difficulty; rather, it is the \r\ndifficulty which is the path.” Let us never forget that \r\nit is through difficult situations that we inscribe the \r\ngreatest causes of humankind.\r\nMr. Muhammad Bande (Nigeria): My delegation \r\nis grateful to the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) for the report (see A/72/349) introduced \r\nfor consideration today. We applaud the Court for its \r\nability to cope with the heavy workload during the \r\nreporting period.\r\nThe ICC was created based on the notion that \r\nimpunity must be challenged and that persons found \r\nguilty of committing serious crimes must be punished. \r\nWe therefore welcome the appreciable progress \r\nrecorded by the Court in the fight against impunity \r\nand crimes against humanity. We commend the Court \r\nfor its significant contributions to the development of \r\nsubstantive and procedural international criminal law. \r\nWe also appreciate the essential contributions of the \r\nCourt to the promotion of the rule of law.\r\nWe have studied the report closely and observed that, \r\nsince the start of its operations, the Court has opened \r\na total of 25 cases and conducted investigations in 10 \r\nsituations: the Central African Republic I and II, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, Darfur in the Sudan, the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, Georgia, Kenya, Libya, Mali and Uganda. \r\nIn addition to its investigations, the Office of the \r\nProsecutor is conducting 10 preliminary examinations \r\nin some countries, among which is Nigeria.\r\nAs indicated in the report, the Office of the \r\nProsecutor analysed information on a variety of \r\ncrimes allegedly committed in different contexts, \r\nincluding alleged sexual and gender-based crimes \r\nin the armed conflict between Boko Haram and the \r\nNigerian security forces. The Office has also gathered \r\ninformation on Nigerian national proceedings relating \r\nto eight potential cases identified by the Office and has \r\nexonerated Nigeria of the allegations arising from the \r\n2011 elections. Nigeria will continue to support the ICC \r\nas it continues its preliminary examination process. \r\nRecently, we had the honour to welcome the chief \r\nProsecutor of the ICC. We appreciate the Prosecutor’s \r\nmeetings with civil-society organizations and victims \r\nof alleged Rome Statute crimes committed in Nigeria.\r\nA/72/PV.37 30/10/2017\r\n10/25 17-35526\r\nWe congratulate the Court for the successful \r\nhandling of its first case involving the destruction \r\nof cultural property, namely, attacks on historic \r\nmonuments in Timbuktu, Mali, which was the Court’s \r\nfirst case involving an admission of guilt by the \r\naccused. That will serve as a good precedent for the \r\nCourt in handling similar cases.\r\nNigeria joins other Member States in commending \r\nthe decisions of the Gambia and South Africa to return \r\nto the Court. As a committed member of the Assembly \r\nof States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court, we wish to reaffirm our commitment \r\nto the Court and the fight against impunity for Rome \r\nStatute crimes. We also believe that the Court represents \r\nan international mechanism for ensuring justice for all.\r\nNigeria wishes to emphasize that it has no intention \r\nof pulling out of the ICC. However, we will continue \r\nto work in concert with States parties of the ICC \r\ntowards improving the working methods of the Court \r\nfor a fairer and more efficient delivery of its mandate \r\nin the service of humankind and equitable justice. \r\nNigeria believes that a strengthened and reinvigorated \r\nICC, as a symbol of the international criminal justice \r\nsystem, has an important role to play in offering solace \r\nto victims of heinous, despicable and dastardly crimes. \r\nWe have a collective duty to this generation and to \r\nfuture generations to give a voice to the voiceless and \r\nensure that the perpetrators of those crimes are brought \r\nto justice.\r\nWe welcome the ongoing support and cooperation \r\nthat the Court receives from the senior leadership of \r\nthe United Nations. We commend the support of the \r\nprevious Secretary-General and equally appreciate \r\nthe supportive engagement with the Court of the \r\ncurrent Secretary-General and his team, and we hope \r\nthat the close collaboration will be sustained. The \r\ncrucial cooperation of the Under-Secretary-General \r\nfor Legal Affairs and Legal Counsel as the interface \r\nbetween the Court and the United Nations is also \r\nhighly appreciated. As the main forum for diplomacy, \r\nthe United Nations presents a unique medium for \r\npromoting the Rome Statute issues and considerations \r\nfor greater understanding.\r\nNigeria welcomes the Court’s ongoing \r\ncooperation with States, non-State parties, regional \r\norganizations, national bar associations and other \r\nrelevant stakeholders. We also wish to express our \r\ngratitude for the generous contributions from the \r\nEuropean Commission, the Netherlands, Norway and \r\nthe International Organization of la Francophonie that \r\nhave enabled the Court to conduct nine high-level and \r\ntechnical events during the reporting period.\r\nConferences and seminars are important forums \r\nwhere participants benefit from the exchange of \r\nideas and information and have an opportunity \r\nto better understand issues. In that connection, \r\nseminars — such as the one in Addis Ababa with African \r\nStates parties — are necessary, as they become veritable \r\navenues for addressing the areas of misunderstanding \r\nbetween African States and the Court.\r\nWe call on non-States parties to become signatories \r\nto the Rome Statute in order to enhance the universality \r\nof the Court and to enable it to function effectively in \r\nthe fight against impunity.\r\nMr. Bin Momen (Bangladesh): Bangladesh thanks \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nfor presenting a comprehensive report (see A/72/\r\nPV.36). We take note of the ICC’s increased workload \r\nand the corresponding demand in the level and scope \r\nof cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nICC. We are pleased to once again co-sponsor the \r\ndraft resolution entitled “Report of the International \r\nCriminal Court” (A/72/L.3).\r\nBangladesh considers the Court’s hearing and \r\nverdict in its first case involving the destruction of \r\ncultural property, as well as admission of guilt by the \r\naccused, to be a significant development. We appreciate \r\nthe report furnished on the situations and cases under \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction, the ongoing investigations \r\ninto 10 cases and the proceedings with reparations for \r\nvictims in four cases (see A/72/349). It is also useful \r\nto have an overview of the preliminary examinations \r\nbeing conducted by the Office of the Prosecutor.\r\nOne of the most compelling narratives emanating \r\nfrom the ICC is the significant number of victims \r\nit has been supporting through its determination of \r\nreparations and also through its Trust Fund for Victims. \r\nWe underline the need for a sustained f low of resources \r\nto that Trust Fund from States parties, philanthropic \r\norganizations, foundations and individuals, among \r\nothers. We thank the Trust Fund in particular for \r\nannouncing the launch of a victims assistance \r\nprogramme in Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nBangladesh attaches great importance to addressing \r\nsexual and gender-based violence during armed conflicts \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.37\r\n17-35526 11/25\r\nand to ensuring accountability and justice for such \r\ncrimes committed by both State and non-State actors. \r\nWe recall the first conviction for sexual violence by the \r\nCourt last year in what is also its first case involving \r\ncommand responsibility. Bangladesh reaffirms its \r\nreadiness to share its national experience in ensuring \r\njustice for victims of rape and other forms of sexual \r\nviolence committed during our war of independence \r\nin 1971, and the renewed judicial and administrative \r\nefforts made in recent times to promote due recognition \r\nand reparation for such victims.\r\nWe stress that the cooperation, assistance and \r\nsupport of State parties to the Rome Statute, as well \r\nas of other States, remain critical for discharging the \r\nICC’s mandate in a sustained and meaningful manner. \r\nWe reiterate the importance of recognizing the ICC’s \r\nmandate and competence through the United Nations \r\nsystem with a view to acknowledging its valuable \r\ncontribution to international peace, the rule of law, and \r\npeaceful, just and inclusive societies.\r\nWe underscore the Security Council’s continued \r\nsupport for the effective functioning of the Court, \r\nincluding for the cases referred to the Court by the \r\nCouncil. As a lead contributor to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations, we will continue to extend \r\nthe necessary cooperation to the Court in the mission \r\nareas where our peacekeepers and military observers \r\nare deployed.\r\nBangladesh attaches high importance to the \r\nprimary responsibility of national jurisdictions to \r\ninvestigate and to prosecute the crimes defined in the \r\nRome Statute. We fully endorse the recommendations \r\nfor the possible inclusion of issues related to the Rome \r\nStatute in legal and judicial reform programmes \r\nsupported by the United Nations in the context of \r\ndevelopment assistance for the rule of law. That would \r\nbe particularly important to States that are not party \r\nto the Rome Statute and that have been alleged to have \r\ncommitted atrocity crimes against their own civilians.\r\nThe ongoing violence and the forcible displacement \r\nbeing pursued by the Myanmar security forces \r\nagainst the Rohingya in Rakhine state reinforce the \r\noverriding importance of adhering to the principles \r\nof the Rome Statute, including in the context of a \r\nf ledgling democracy. The international community, \r\nespecially the Security Council, has a responsibility to \r\nseek accountability for what the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights has termed a textbook \r\nexample of ethnic cleansing in Rakhine state. In a \r\nrecent statement, the Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the Prevention of Genocide and the Special \r\nAdviser on the Responsibility to Protect emphasized \r\nthat those implicated in the commission of the reported \r\natrocity crimes must be held accountable, whatever \r\ntheir status. It is critical that the Myanmar authorities \r\nallow access to the United Nations fact-finding mission \r\nas an important first step in that regard.\r\nAs a State party, Bangladesh remains committed \r\nto the promotion of the universality and the full \r\nimplementation of the Rome Statute. We thank two \r\nStates parties for reversing their decision concerning \r\ntheir notifications of withdrawal from the Rome \r\nStatute. The ICC cooperation seminars and other \r\ncooperation arrangements with relevant international \r\nand regional organizations should also contribute to the \r\nuniversalization agenda.\r\nBangladesh underscores the need for appropriate \r\ncapacity-building support, through training and the \r\nsharing of knowledge, for national jurisdictions of State \r\nparties, pursuant to the principle of complementarity. In \r\nthat context, we reiterate the need to consider budgetary \r\nsupport for internships and visiting professional \r\nprogrammes for applicants from States parties \r\nrepresenting developing and least developed countries. \r\nWe reiterate that due attention should be given to \r\nensuring equitable geographical representation for \r\nstaffing at the Court, especially at the professional level.\r\nBangladesh looks to the forthcoming session of \r\nthe Assembly of States Parties for constructive and \r\npragmatic decisions, including on the activation of the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. We \r\nthank those delegations that have actively contributed \r\nto taking forward the intersessional work.\r\nTo conclude, we reiterate the need to uphold \r\nsolidarity among States parties and the integrity and \r\ncredibility of the legal and judicial proceedings of the \r\nCourt in the overarching interest of fighting impunity \r\nfor internationally defined crimes wherever and by \r\nwhomsoever they are committed.\r\nMr. Oña Garcés (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Ecuador expresses its appreciation \r\nto the President of the International Criminal Court, \r\nMs. Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, for her presence \r\nat the meeting this morning (see A/72/PV.36) to \r\npresent the report of the International Criminal Court \r\nA/72/PV.37 30/10/2017\r\n12/25 17-35526\r\non its work carried out in 2016 and 2017, contained in \r\ndocument A/72/349, issued on 17 August.\r\nEcuador has consistently defended the role of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and justice as an essential component \r\nof conflict prevention and of reparations to the victims \r\nof the most serious crimes. On this occasion, we \r\nreiterate our support for the Court as a mechanism with \r\nunique characteristics to fight impunity. We call for all \r\nStates present in the Hall to also lend their support so \r\nthat the Court can effectively and concretely exercise \r\nits jurisdiction over persons and its competence with \r\nrespect to the most serious crimes of concern to the \r\ninternational community.\r\nCertainly that is the least that should be done \r\nwhen history has witnessed past and present events \r\nthat have made children, women and men victims \r\nof unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the \r\nconscience of humankind, as stated in the preamble to \r\nthe Rome Statute. Indeed, the crime of genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression, \r\nwhich are subject to complementary jurisdiction, can be \r\nappropriately judged if there is universal accession by \r\nStates to the Statute and if States provide the necessary \r\ncooperation to the Court.\r\nIn that regard, for Ecuador, the universality of the \r\nRome Statute must be an irrevocable objective that \r\nwill enable us to achieve genuine universal criminal \r\njustice that ensures the fight against impunity and \r\nallows for the due punishment of those who commit \r\nthe most serious crimes affecting the international \r\ncommunity. However, the universality of the Statute is \r\nnot just full membership of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, but also the guarantee that all cases involving \r\nthe commission of crimes subject to the jurisdiction of \r\nthe Court are tried without double standards, without \r\nexceptions based on political or economic interests \r\nand without the use of different parameters to measure \r\nthe same situations. To ensure such independence, it is \r\nessential that the International Criminal Court have the \r\nnecessary financial resources to carry out its work and \r\nthat any reduction in expenses not affect crucial areas \r\nof the Court’s functioning.\r\nWe also believe that the strengthening of \r\ninternational criminal justice requires the acceptance \r\nof the Kampala amendments, adopted in 2010. Ecuador \r\nis in the process of ratifying those amendments. \r\nWe believe that the entry into force of the Kampala \r\namendments will mark a historic milestone in the \r\nhistory of international criminal justice.\r\nIn addition, we believe that it is necessary to \r\nstrengthen the mechanisms for obtaining resources \r\nand invigorating the cooperation of the international \r\ncommunity with regard to the Trust Fund for Victims, to \r\nthe extent that the Fund assists the work of the Court on \r\na fundamental element of justice, that is, the protection \r\nof victims and reparations for the crimes dealt with in \r\nthe Rome Statute.\r\nWe also wish to reiterate our position with regard \r\nto the principle of complementarity with the Court. \r\nWe attach particular importance to complementarity, \r\nsince it is a mechanism that allows States to cooperate \r\nin the fight against impunity and has something \r\nof singular importance, namely, national capacity-\r\nbuilding. Through complementarity, the International \r\nCriminal Court supports national legislations; it is not \r\na substitute for them.\r\nFinally, my delegation would also like to express its \r\nsupport for the efforts of the United Nations system to \r\nimprove the channels of cooperation with the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor and other organs of the Court. We call \r\non Member States to provide all possible support for \r\nthe fulfilment and execution of the orders issued by the \r\nrelevant authorities of the International Criminal Court.\r\nMrs. Gregoire Van Haaren (Netherlands): The \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered by the observer of the European \r\nUnion (see A/72/PV.36).\r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands would also like \r\nto join others in expressing gratitude to President \r\nFernández de Gurmendi for her presence in the Hall \r\ntoday and wishes to compliment her for her outstanding \r\npresentation (see A/72/PV.36). The annual report of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (see A/72/349) gives \r\na clear overview of the considerable work done in the \r\nreporting period and of the challenges ahead.\r\nGiven the great importance of the topic at hand, \r\nallow me to briefly address the following three issues: \r\nthe fight against impunity, the current challenges facing \r\nthe Court, and the universality of the Rome Statute.\r\nFirst, the Kingdom of the Netherlands remains \r\ndeeply committed to the fight against impunity for \r\nthe most serious international crimes. In that light, we \r\nwelcome the fact that the threshold of 30 ratifications \r\nof the crime of aggression amendments has been met, \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.37\r\n17-35526 13/25\r\nwhich enables the Assembly of States Parties to activate \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction on the crime of aggression at \r\nits upcoming session. The Kingdom of the Netherlands \r\nattaches great importance to a clear decision of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties in that respect, as it will \r\nconstitute a fundamental step towards ensuring \r\naccountability and ending impunity.\r\nWhile underlining the Court’s essential role in the \r\nfight against impunity for all core international crimes, \r\nwe would like to stress that the primary responsibility \r\nfor ensuring accountability continues to lie with States, \r\nas follows from the principle of complementarity. In \r\norder to maintain a functioning system of international \r\ncriminal justice, thereby promoting international peace \r\nand justice overall, it is important to stress the primary \r\nresponsibility of States to investigate and prosecute the \r\ncrimes as defined in the Rome Statute. The adoption \r\nof national legislation in order to effectively implement \r\nthe Statute is of critical importance. To put it in simple \r\nterms: justice begins at the national level, and not in \r\nThe Hague.\r\nThat brings me to the second point I want to \r\naddress. As the report sets out clearly, the International \r\nCriminal Court is confronting a tremendous workload. \r\nIn dealing with the many challenges, with that heavy \r\nworkload and high expectations, the Court should be \r\nable to depend upon the States parties in a number \r\nof ways. First, the financing of the Court needs to \r\nbe adequate. We cannot expect more from the Court \r\nwithout ensuring that it has sufficient means to meet \r\nthose increasing expectations. Secondly, as the Court \r\nhas itself repeatedly underlined, it inevitably has to rely \r\non the States parties for the enforcement of its decisions \r\nand judgments. The Rome Statute clearly lays down the \r\nobligations of the States parties to support and facilitate \r\nthe work of the Court throughout the various stages \r\nof its judicial proceedings. In that respect, various \r\nforms of voluntary cooperation, such as the conclusion \r\nand implementation of framework agreements on the \r\nrelocation of witnesses and the execution of judgements, \r\nconstitute a vital contribution to the effective and \r\nefficient functioning of the Court.\r\nAs the Court is more occupied than ever and \r\nconfronts an impressive number of trials, appeals, \r\ninvestigations by the Prosecutor, preliminary \r\nexaminations and continent-crossing situation \r\ninvestigations, it is imperative for States parties to assist \r\nthe Court. That relates not only to their contributions \r\nto the regular budget, but also to the need to intensify \r\ntheir voluntary cooperation with the Court. Without \r\nthat cooperation, the Court will be unable to effectively \r\nexercise its mandate.\r\nThirdly, I would like to address the issue of the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute. The International \r\nCriminal Court embodies norms and values that are \r\nboth fundamental and universal. On that basis, the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands would like to reiterate the \r\nimportance of the ratification of the Rome Statute by all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations. In that regard, \r\nwe welcome the decisions taken by those countries \r\nthat reversed their previously announced intention to \r\nwithdraw from the Rome Statute.\r\nWe commend the various organs of the Court for \r\ntheir comprehensive efforts to promote a meaningful \r\nand constructive dialogue with those and other States \r\nparties. We express our hope that the positive signals and \r\nexpressions of trust in the Court’s fundamental mission \r\nwill resonate throughout the international community. \r\nWe believe that next year’s milestone — the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute —\r\nwill provide a unique opportunity to emphasize the \r\ncrucial relevance of the Court and advocate for more \r\nglobal support.\r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands and, more \r\nspecifically, The Hague, as the international city \r\nof peace and justice, are the proud hosts of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. As we approach the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the Rome Statute, let us work \r\ntogether in promoting the universality of its mission. \r\nLet us strengthen our cooperation in facing present-\r\nday challenges, which unfortunately pose threats to the \r\nmaintenance of international justice. The fight against \r\nimpunity is more pressing than ever. Strengthening \r\ncooperation among States parties, but also between \r\nStates parties and with the Court, is of paramount \r\nimportance in that regard. Securing global justice is, \r\nafter all, our joint responsibility.\r\nMs. Agladze (Georgia): Georgia aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered on behalf of the European \r\nUnion (see A/72/PV.36). In addition, I would like to add \r\na few remarks in my national capacity.\r\nAt the outset, let me thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), Ms. Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi, for the report on the activities \r\nof the Court (see A/72/349). My delegation wishes \r\nto recognize her dedication, which has been pivotal \r\nin guiding the Court during uneasy periods of its \r\nA/72/PV.37 30/10/2017\r\n14/25 17-35526\r\nexistence. We also thank the President of the Assembly \r\nof States Parties to the Rome Statute, Mr. Sidiki Kaba, \r\nfor his role and leadership in this critical period.\r\nThis year’s report features several important \r\nachievements of the Court, including the first case \r\ninvolving the destruction of cultural property as an \r\nattack against historic monuments and buildings. \r\nThat case marked the first precedent in the Court’s \r\nproceedings of the admission of guilt by the accused. \r\nThe ongoing discussions on the activation of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction concerning the crime of aggression are of \r\ncritical importance, and we would like to commend \r\nthe facilitator for the able stewardship and for all the \r\nefforts made. Georgia has ratified the amendments to \r\nthe Rome Statute on the crime of aggression and looks \r\nforward to the decision in December of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties on its swift activation.\r\nPreventing the most heinous crimes that threaten \r\nthe peace, security and well-being of the world is \r\nvital to upholding the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel, based on the principles of international law and \r\nthe common values of humankind that both the Court \r\nand the United Nations share. While we approach \r\nthe twentieth anniversary of the creation of the ICC, \r\nsadly the world continues to witness crimes of an \r\nunspeakable scale and gravity. The establishment of \r\nthe International Criminal Court set a new paradigm. \r\nAccountability is important to build a future free of \r\nviolence by avoiding the recurrence of conflicts and \r\nrepetition of violence, as well as to ensure justice for \r\nvictims of mass atrocity crimes.\r\nGeorgia reaffirms its commitment to the work \r\nundertaken by the Court in accordance with its \r\nmandate. Effective and comprehensive cooperation and \r\nassistance by States are indispensable for the Court to \r\ncarry out its activities successfully, more so given the \r\nCourt’s complementary role to that of national criminal \r\njurisdictions. Georgia has been cooperating with the \r\nCourt ever since the ICC Prosecutor announced the \r\nstart of the preliminary examination of the 2008 war in \r\nGeorgia, on 14 August 2008. As an enabling factor for \r\nthe full-f ledged cooperation with the ICC, Georgia has \r\nput in place adequate implementing legislation for the \r\nRome Statute at the national level.\r\nMoreover, on 26 July 2017, the Registrar of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, Mr. Herman von Hebel, \r\non behalf of the Court signed an agreement with the \r\nGovernment of Georgia in Tbilisi to facilitate the \r\nCourt’s activities and ongoing investigations in the \r\ncountry. I would like to recall some of the key aspects \r\nof the ongoing cooperation with the ICC.\r\nGeorgia has been the victim of international crimes \r\nsince the 1990s — and notably in August 2008, when \r\nthousands of civilians were targeted in a repeated wave \r\nof ethnic cleansing and other heinous crimes. At the \r\nnational level, Georgia has carried out investigations \r\nof an unprecedented scale. The investigation team \r\ninterviewed more than 7,000 witnesses and carried out \r\ncrime-scene inspections in over 30 inhabited areas. \r\nWhere evidence was inaccessible due to the Russian \r\noccupation of the Georgian territories, the crime scenes \r\nwere examined through satellite imagery.\r\nDespite our continued efforts, our ability to carry \r\nout additional necessary investigative measures in \r\nthe Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions at this stage is \r\nhampered by the illegal foreign occupation. In those \r\ncircumstances, the request of Prosecutor Bensouda \r\nand the subsequent decision of Pre-Trial Chamber I \r\nto authorize an investigation into all crimes under the \r\nRome Statute committed during the 2008 international \r\narmed conflict between the Russian Federation and \r\nGeorgia have been recognized as important steps in \r\nacknowledging the ordeal suffered by the victims.\r\nThe same Chamber decision stated that an \r\ninternational armed conflict existed between Georgia \r\nand the Russian Federation between 1 July 2008 and \r\n10 October 2008. Pre-Trial Chamber I further noted \r\nthat the consistent pattern of deliberate killing, beating \r\nand threatening civilians, detention, looting properties \r\nand systematic destruction of Georgian houses \r\ntook place. As the Prosecutor emphasized, we hope that \r\nthe investigation will lead to establishing the truth and \r\nbringing justice to the victims who suffered so terribly \r\nduring the conflict.\r\nGeorgia will continue to strongly support the Court \r\nin its critical work and stands ready to further strengthen \r\ncooperation with all States parties in reaching the goals \r\nof ending impunity, upholding justice and achieving \r\nsustainable peace.\r\nMr. Llorentty Solíz (Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia): The Plurinational State of Bolivia would like \r\nto express its gratitude for the report (see A/72/349) \r\non the activities of the International Criminal Court \r\nsubmitted by its President, Judge Silvia Fernández de \r\nGurmendi (see A/72/PV.36), and we thank her for her \r\nleadership at the head of the Court.\r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.37\r\n17-35526 15/25\r\n The Bolivian State, which respects international \r\nlaw, abides by the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the Rome Statute \r\nand recognizes the importance of the principles of \r\ncomplementarity and cooperation with the International \r\nCriminal Court. Bolivia had an active part in the \r\nestablishment of the Court, and in its development \r\nthrough the Assembly of States Parties since its signing \r\nof the Rome Statute in 1998.\r\nBolivia takes due note of the course of jurisdictional \r\nactivities completed and the tasks the Court undertakes \r\nto consolidate its complex institutional organization \r\nand to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the \r\nwork of the various organs of which it is composed. We \r\nacknowledge the Court’s progress in resolving its cases \r\nand the increase in new investigations, which could lead \r\nto a greater caseload at a pace gradually consolidating \r\nthe principles of international criminal justice.\r\nThe discovery of truth through the gathering of \r\nevidence and witness testimonies in very diverse \r\ncultural contexts is a complex task that requires the \r\nfull cooperation and complementarity of judicial \r\nsystems, both from the States that are requesting the \r\njurisdiction of the Court and from the United Nations \r\nthrough support in the cases that are referred by the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIn the cases referred by the Security Council, it \r\nwill be necessary to study, within the Council, the need \r\nto supplement the Court’s budget to cover the costs of \r\ninvestigations, trials and possible victim reparations. In \r\nthat context, we note the need for greater coordination \r\nand cooperation among the Court, the Security Council \r\nand the wider United Nations to achieve the common \r\nobjectives of international peace and security.\r\nAt the end of its first 15 years of existence and nearly \r\n20 years since the signing of the Rome Statute, the Court \r\nhas shown its ability to solve complex cases in sensitive \r\nareas. The scope of the Statute is still being tested \r\ntoday, and the difficulties of an unprecedented model \r\nof universal criminal justice for a multipolar, diverse \r\nand plural world are being overcome labouriously.\r\nThe International Criminal Court is part of a \r\nglobal undertaking that affects all States. Its mission \r\nis consonant with strengthening international criminal \r\njustice and the values it embodies: peace and security, \r\nrespect for human rights, guarantees of due process, \r\nprotection of victims and the end of impunity. In that \r\nconnection, we call for its universality and urge those \r\nStates that are not yet party to join it.\r\nIt is appropriate to repeat that it is not possible to \r\nleave unpunished those who committed, or continue to \r\ncommit, crimes affecting the international community. \r\nAll States, whether they are party to the Court’s Statute \r\nor not, have the primary responsibility for taking \r\naction and contributing to the prevention and trial of \r\nsuch crimes. The International Criminal Court, acting \r\nindependently and effectively, using the best methods \r\nof cooperation and complementarity with States, is \r\nvital to guarantee universal criminal justice.\r\nMr. Pérez de Nanclares (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOnce again, I have the honour of addressing the General \r\nAssembly on an issue that Spain considers to be of the \r\nutmost importance. The fight against the most serious \r\ninternational crimes constitutes, without any doubt, an \r\nessential element in maintaining international peace \r\nand justice. It is also an imperative f lowing from \r\nthe principle of the rule of law, which is inherent to \r\nthe international legal system. Fighting impunity, \r\nprosecuting the criminals who commit such crimes \r\nand ensuring justice for the victims must be permanent \r\ngoals for the whole international community.\r\nBesides endorsing the speech delivered by the \r\nobserver of the European Union (see A/72/PV.36), \r\nI would like to highlight the work undertaken by the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). That work is \r\ndetailed in the report (see A/72/349) covering the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2016 to 31 July 2017, which \r\nwas presented this morning by the President, Judge \r\nFernández de Gurmendi (see A/72/PV.36). To her, \r\nthe judges, Prosecutor Bensouda and the rest of the \r\nCourt’s personnel we express our most sincere thanks. \r\nWe also thank the Mexican delegation for its work in \r\nthe promotion and coordination of the draft resolution \r\n(A/72/L.3), which Spain has co-sponsored.\r\nSince the very beginning of the preparations for the \r\nRome Statute, Spain has been a strong advocate of the \r\nrole assigned to the ICC in the difficult task of fighting \r\nimpunity with the tools of the international rule of law. \r\nWe also played a very active role at the 2010 Kampala \r\nConference. Accordingly, the Kingdom of Spain \r\nsubmitted its instrument of ratification of the Kampala \r\namendments quite early, on 24 September 2014. There \r\nis no doubt that my country will maintain its traditional \r\nfirm and sincere support to the work of the Court.\r\nA/72/PV.37 30/10/2017\r\n16/25 17-35526\r\nAt the present time, we are all perfectly aware of \r\nthe existing disagreement regarding the activation of \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. \r\nThe consensus compromise reached at the Kampala \r\nConference, reflected in articles 8 bis, 15 bis and 15 ter, \r\nallowed for the adoption of the text of the amendments \r\nand the successful conclusion of the Conference. Now \r\nthat the threshold of the 30 ratifications needed for \r\nits entry into force has been surpassed, the Assembly \r\nof States Parties will be responsible for adopting the \r\ndecision to activate the jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nHowever, the underlying problem has re-emerged. \r\nDifferent positions have emerged as to whether the \r\nfocus is on article 15 ter, paragraph 3, or on article \r\n121, paragraph 5. They reach diametrically opposed \r\nconclusions. That makes it extremely difficult to \r\nforecast the result of the next session of the Assembly \r\nof States Parties, to be held in December.\r\nIn that connection, Spain would like to commend \r\nAustria’s work as facilitator and advocate above all for \r\nreaching a desirable consensus within the Assembly of \r\nState Parties. Moreover, we also stand for the need to \r\ncomply with what was agreed in Kampala. That is why \r\nthe decision to be finally adopted should not imply the \r\nreopening, de facto or de jure, of the negotiation of what \r\nwas agreed in Kampala, already ratified by 34 States.\r\nWithout going into specific figures, which have \r\nalready been mentioned repeatedly by the speakers \r\nwho preceded me, I would like to underline four of the \r\npositive aspects of the work carried out by the Court in \r\nthe past year.\r\nFirst is the extension of the geographic scope of \r\nthe Court’s action, which encompasses four continents: \r\nAmerica, Africa, Asia and Europe. The fight against \r\nimpunity for international crimes knows and should \r\nknow no borders.\r\nSecondly, we must commend the influence of the \r\nCourt on State-level proceedings against the crimes \r\nunder its jurisdiction. There have been various instances \r\nin which, pursuant to the principle of complementarity, \r\nthe Court has not exercised its jurisdiction because of \r\nthe intervention of national jurisdictional bodies.\r\nThirdly, we welcome the consolidation of the role \r\nof the Trust Fund for Victims, which, as the observer \r\nof the European Union said this morning, constitutes \r\nan essential pillar of the work of the International \r\nCriminal Court.\r\nLastly, we applaud the Court’s first conviction \r\nfor offences against the administration of justice, in \r\naccordance with article 70 of the Rome Statute, as well \r\nas the consideration given to the attacks on historic \r\nmonuments and buildings.\r\nDespite the undoubtedly positive assessment of the \r\noverall work of the Court, there are at least four aspects \r\nthat require a critical assessment.\r\nThe first is the withdrawal of Burundi. Our \r\nambition is for the number of State parties of the Statute \r\nto continue increasing, without any withdrawals. In \r\nthat regard, we must welcome the fact that South Africa \r\nand the Gambia reconsidered their initial decisions to \r\nwithdraw from the Statute.\r\nThe second aspect that has become a source of \r\nsome concern pertains to collaboration between the \r\nCourt and the Security Council. We believe that the \r\nreport of the Court clearly identifies the elements \r\nwhere improved collaboration is desirable. Those \r\nelements point towards sanctions approved by the \r\nSecurity Council and its reaction, or lack thereof, to \r\nthe notifications of non-collaboration sent to it by the \r\nICC. We believe that we should take serious note of the \r\nreport of the Court and act accordingly.\r\nA third element to be underlined is the fact that we, \r\nthe States, must act in appropriate fashion. Cooperation \r\nwith the Court and the proper execution of its decisions \r\nis vital to achieve the necessary credibility of the \r\nsystem. In that regard, particular attention should be \r\npaid to the arrest of suspects.\r\nFinally, we believe that we must also draw attention \r\nto the need for the Court to carry out its work effectively \r\nand efficiently, based on good governance and \r\ntransparency. That in no way precludes our recognition \r\nof the notable efforts and advances that the Court has \r\nachieved recently.\r\nSpain wishes to conclude by underscoring the \r\nvital importance of the Court in the maintenance \r\nof peace, justice and the rule of law through the \r\neffective fight against impunity for the most serious \r\ncrimes committed against humanity, while reiterating \r\nthe firm commitment of our country to pursue that \r\ncommendable objective.\r\nMr. Okaiteye (Ghana): I would like to join previous \r\nspeakers in thanking the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) and the Secretary-General for \r\ntheir comprehensive report on the activities of the Court \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.37\r\n17-35526 17/25\r\nfor the period 2016/2017, as reflected in the report of \r\nthe Court (see A/72/349).\r\nGhana attaches great importance to the work of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and its role in ensuring \r\naccountability for crimes, providing justice to victims \r\nand helping to prevent future crimes. In recognition of \r\nthe relevance of international criminal justice for the \r\nrule of law and international peace and security, Ghana \r\nremains committed to the Rome Statute and wishes to \r\ntake this opportunity to pledge its unwavering support \r\nfor the Court and its activities. Ghana’s democracy is \r\nstrongly rooted in respect for the rule of law, and we \r\nbelieve that the culture of impunity for atrocity crimes \r\nshould have no place in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe targets established under Goal 16 of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals provide additional \r\nreasons why international criminal justice issues must \r\nbe mainstreamed within the framework of the rule of \r\nlaw at the national and international levels, and we \r\nsupport the views expressed in the report in that regard.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the highly valuable \r\ncooperation that the ICC maintains with the United \r\nNations and efforts to strengthen the linkages between \r\nthe mandates of the United Nations and the Court. We \r\nvery much encourage the further strengthening of that \r\nengagement at the working level. We also encourage the \r\nCourt to explore opportunities for c1oser engagement \r\nwith regional organizations, in particular with the \r\nAfrican Union, which has a strong peace and security \r\nagenda. While the Court and the Security Council have \r\ndifferent roles in addressing grave crimes, those roles, \r\nas rightly indicated in the report, are complementary. \r\nWe therefore look forward to increased cooperation \r\nand complementarity between the two bodies in order \r\nto improve the implementation of obligations, enhance \r\ncrime prevention and effectively combat impunity.\r\nAs indicated in the report, the primary \r\nresponsibility of national jurisdictions to investigate \r\nand prosecute crimes defined in the Rome Statute, \r\nand strengthening their capacity to do so effectively, \r\nremains critical to ending impunity for international \r\ncrimes. Consequently, development assistance for \r\nbuilding capacities in international investigations and \r\nprosecution and for the incorporation into national \r\nlegislation of Rome Statute crimes and principles and \r\nnational processes for cooperation with the Court are \r\nan important area of activity.\r\nMy delegation takes note of the heavy workload \r\nof the Court in the period under review. With a total \r\nof 25 ongoing cases and investigations in 10 situations \r\nand other preliminary examinations, that is evidence \r\nthat the Court is more relevant today than ever. In the \r\nlight of that fact, we wish to call on States parties to \r\nseriously consider the issue of complementarity as one \r\nof the options to be explored in addressing the overload \r\nof the Court’s work. We call for capacity-building at the \r\nnational level so that national courts can take ownership \r\nof some of the trials. Certainly, the independence of \r\nthose national courts should be paramount in the \r\ncapacity-building efforts in order to ensure that fair \r\ntrials are held.\r\nMy delegation wishes to commend the Court for \r\nits activities relating to reparations and assistance \r\nprovided through the Trust Fund for Victims, as \r\nreflected in paragraphs 117 and 118 of the report. That \r\nwill help to assuage the suffering of victims and give \r\nsuccour to their dependants. We urge States parties \r\nto continue to support the Fund and to sustain the \r\nassistance programmes.\r\nIn view of the importance Ghana attaches to \r\nthose issues, the Government has decided to present \r\nthe candidature of Ms. Henrietta Joy Abena Nyarko \r\nMensa-Bonsu for election as a judge in the ICC in \r\nthe upcoming elections in December. Suffice it to say \r\nthat Ms. Mensa-Bonsu has all the qualities that States \r\nparties are looking for in the judges of such an eminent \r\nCourt. We believe that she will be an asset to the Court \r\nif elected.\r\nWe will remain actively engaged in efforts to \r\nstrengthen the role of the Court as an integral part of \r\nthe international legal system and to promote broad and \r\nstrong support for its important work.\r\nMr. Trujillo (United States of America): We thank \r\nPresident Fernández de Gurmendi for her update of the \r\nactivities of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nfrom 1 August 2016 through 31 July 2017.\r\nThe United States remains deeply committed to \r\naccountability for atrocity crimes, and we continue \r\nto support myriad international, regional, hybrid and \r\ndomestic mechanisms that work in pursuit of that goal. \r\nAmong those options, we have long believed and stated \r\nthat justice is most effective when it is delivered at the \r\nlocal level. We would call on the ICC and States to \r\nrespect genuine domestic efforts to promote justice for \r\natrocity crimes.\r\nA/72/PV.37 30/10/2017\r\n18/25 17-35526\r\nAs we look across the landscape of international \r\njustice, we see countries taking on that important task, \r\nand the United States welcomes the progress they have \r\nmade. In the Central African Republic, personnel have \r\nbeen appointed to the Special Criminal Court to begin \r\nthe work of ending impunity for mass atrocities in that \r\ncountry. Since May, the Head International Prosecutor \r\nas well as national and international magistrates, \r\nprosecutors and investigators have been named. We are \r\nalso encouraged by the work of the Kosovo Specialist \r\nChambers, which continues to ready itself for the \r\nindictments from the Specialist Prosecutor’s Office. In \r\nthe past year, a roster of judges, along with the President \r\nof the Court, was selected, and the judges convened and \r\nadopted rules of procedure and evidence.\r\nIn addition to those positive steps in domestic \r\nsystems, the United States is pleased to see advancements \r\nin a number of regional and hybrid efforts to end \r\nimpunity for atrocity crimes. For example, in November \r\nof last year, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts \r\nof Cambodia upheld the convictions of Nuon Chea and \r\nKhieu Samphan for crimes against humanity, finally \r\nbringing a measure of justice for the victims of murder, \r\npersecution and other inhumane acts in Cambodia \r\ndecades ago. In South Sudan, the African Union is \r\nworking with the South Sudanese Government to \r\nprepare for judicial processes of accountability, taking \r\nsteps to establish a hybrid court to prosecute those \r\nresponsible for atrocities committed in that country. \r\nFor institutions like these, there is still much work to be \r\ndone, but every step forward is a welcome one.\r\nIn that vein, the United States has supported building \r\na foundation for accountability through documentation \r\nof atrocities that help domestic courts deliver justice. In \r\nIraq, for example, the United States supported Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2379 (2017), adopted last month, \r\nrequesting that the Secretary-General establish an \r\ninvestigative team composed of international and Iraqi \r\nexperts, headed by a special adviser, to support Iraqi \r\ndomestic efforts to hold the Islamic State in Iraq and \r\nthe Levant (ISIL) accountable by collecting, preserving \r\nand storing evidence in Iraq of acts that may amount \r\nto genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\r\nInformation gathered by the team could be used by \r\nIraq, and, with the approval of the Security Council, \r\nother Member States, on the territory of which ISIL \r\nhas committed acts that may amount to genocide, war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity, may request the \r\nteam to collect evidence of such acts. The resolution \r\nfurther encourages other Member States to provide \r\nappropriate legal assistance and capacity-building to \r\nthe Government of Iraq in order to strengthen its courts \r\nand judicial system. Taking timely steps to gather \r\nevidence for potential use in criminal prosecutions will \r\nbe particularly important, as we know that over time \r\nmaterial and witness testimony may be more difficult \r\nor impossible to obtain.\r\nThe United States has for years supported Syrian \r\nnon-governmental organizations that are documenting \r\nhuman rights abuses and international humanitarian \r\nlaw violations in Syria, as well as the Independent \r\nInternational Commission of Inquiry, which was \r\nestablished in 2011 by the United Nations Human Rights \r\nCouncil with a mandate to investigate all human rights \r\nviolations in Syria. The United States has also strongly \r\nsupported the call for accountability in numerous \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and supported the \r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-\r\nUnited Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism to \r\ninvestigate chemical-weapon attacks.\r\nIn the past year, we have supported the international \r\ncommunity in taking efforts one step further with the \r\nInternational, Impartial and Independent Mechanism \r\nfor the Syrian Arab Republic, established through \r\nresolution 71/248, in December 2016. Its mandate is \r\nto consolidate and analyse evidence of violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and abuses and violations \r\nof human rights law, including evidence generated \r\nby the Committee on Information, non-governmental \r\norganizations and others, and to prepare files in order \r\nto facilitate fair and independent criminal proceedings \r\nin the appropriate forums. That can be an important \r\nstep forward to support investigations and prosecutions \r\nof perpetrators of atrocities in Syria.\r\nAs those and other efforts demonstrate, it is \r\nthrough multiple institutions and mechanisms that the \r\ninternational community can fight to end impunity \r\nfor those crimes that shock our common conscience. \r\nAs the United States considers these issues and how \r\nthey relate to the ICC moving forward, I would recall \r\nthat we have serious concerns with respect to the crime \r\nof aggression amendments, which we believe contain \r\ndangerous ambiguities regarding basic issues, such as \r\nwhich States and what conduct would be covered by \r\nthe amendments. As we have said consistently, we \r\nbelieve that such issues should be clarified before any \r\ndecision is taken by the ICC States parties to activate \r\nthe amendments. Taking concrete steps to do so will \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.37\r\n17-35526 19/25\r\nhelp ensure that States are able to join together when \r\nnecessary to take action to prevent atrocities and \r\nsafeguard collective security.\r\nIn conclusion, as long as minorities in Burma \r\nare persecuted and murdered, as long as civilians are \r\nattacked with chemical weapons in Syria, as long as \r\nSouth Sudanese children are abducted and forced into \r\ncombat and as long as people are being tortured and \r\ndisappeared in Burundi, States cannot stand by idly. \r\nThose who are responsible for atrocities must face \r\nconsequences for their actions in accordance with \r\ninternational law. Steadfast in our commitment to \r\npursue justice for the world’s worst crimes, the United \r\nStates will continue our work towards that end.\r\nMrs. Pino Rivero (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Cuba takes note of the report of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (see A/72/349) and \r\nexpresses its commitment to the fight against impunity \r\nfor crimes that affect the international community. \r\nSeveral issues — such as the international situation \r\ncharacterized by armed conflicts, foreign interventions \r\nto the detriment of the principles of international law, \r\nwhich directly affects the people, and the attempts \r\nto withdraw from the Rome Statute by some of its \r\nmembers — positively demonstrate once more the \r\nneed for an autonomous international institution of \r\njurisdiction, which would lead the fight against impunity \r\nfor the most serious crimes against humankind.\r\nHowever, based on what is stipulated in articles \r\n13 (b) and 16 of the Rome Statute, which demonstrate \r\nthe ample powers bestowed upon the Security Council \r\nin relation to the work of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, the reality is that the Court is far from being an \r\nindependent institution. Apart from undermining the \r\nessence of that organ’s jurisdiction, this issue violates \r\nthe principle of independence of judicial bodies and \r\nthe transparency and impartiality of the administration \r\nof justice.\r\nThe referrals made to the Court by the Security \r\nCouncil, which are included in the Court’s report, \r\nconfirm that negative trend, to which our country has \r\nmade reference on various occasions. We reiterate once \r\nagain that, in the referral processes of the Security \r\nCouncil, international law is constantly violated, \r\nevidencing a selective policy towards developing \r\ncountries, in the name of a supposed fight against \r\nimpunity. That is why Cuba reiterates its position in \r\nfavour of the establishment of an international criminal \r\njurisdiction that is impartial, non-selective, effective, \r\nfair, complementary to national justice systems \r\nand genuinely independent, and therefore free from \r\nsubjugation to political interests that might erode \r\nits essence.\r\nThe delegation of Cuba reiterates that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court cannot ignore \r\ninternational treaties and the principles of international \r\nlaw. The Court must respect the principle of law \r\nwith respect to the consent of a State to be bound by \r\na treaty, as provided for in article 11 of part II of the \r\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, of 23 May \r\n1969. Cuba wishes to reiterate its serious concern \r\nabout the precedent set by the decisions of the Court \r\nto initiate judicial proceedings against nationals of \r\nStates non-parties to the Rome Statute that have not \r\neven accepted the jurisdiction of the Court, pursuant to \r\narticle 12 of its Statute.\r\nThe International Criminal Court must report to \r\nthe General Assembly on its activities in accordance \r\nwith the Relationship Agreement. Although Cuba is not \r\na party to the Criminal Court, it is willing to continue \r\nto actively participate in negotiation processes related \r\nto the Court, and especially on the draft resolution \r\non the report of the International Criminal Court that \r\nthe General Assembly adopts every year, which must \r\nreflect the positions of both States parties and States \r\nnon-parties to the Court.\r\nCuba reaffirms its determination to fight impunity \r\nand maintains its commitment to international criminal \r\njustice, to the principles of transparency, independence \r\nand impartiality and to the unrestricted application of \r\nand respect for international law.\r\nMrs. Betham-Malielegaoi (Samoa): Samoa wishes \r\nto convey its sincere appreciation to President Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi for her commitment and for the \r\nachievements she has brought about during her tenure \r\nas Judge and President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. We also thank her for the warm sentiments she \r\nexpressed with regard to Samoa.\r\nSamoa welcomes the constructive report on the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (see A/72/349) and is \r\npleased to be one of the sponsors of draft resolution \r\nA/72/L.3. Samoa notes with satisfaction that there are \r\nnow 124 States parties to the Rome Statute and further \r\nwelcomes the fact that, as of now, 34 States parties \r\nhave ratified the Kampala amendments on the crime of \r\naggression. Like other States parties, Samoa hopes that \r\nA/72/PV.37 30/10/2017\r\n20/25 17-35526\r\nthe sixteenth session of the Assembly of States Parties \r\nto the Rome Statute will bring about the activation of \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, as \r\nagreed in Kampala in 2010.\r\nSamoa wishes to reiterate its unwavering support \r\nfor the Court and its full commitment to the principles \r\nof the Rome Statute and the rule of law, as Samoa has \r\ncontinually demonstrated through its actions. Indeed, \r\nby hosting the President of the International Court \r\nduring the forty-eighth Pacific Island Forum, held in \r\nApia in September, Samoa clearly demonstrated its \r\nfaith in the Court by facilitating the universality of the \r\nRome Statute.\r\nIn that regard, Samoa calls upon States Members of \r\nthe United Nations, especially small island developing \r\nStates like our own, which have no military capacity \r\nand remain dependent on the rule of law, to consider \r\nratifying the Rome Statute as part of their national \r\nimplementation of Sustainable Development Goal 16. \r\nFor Samoa, being a State party to the Rome Statute \r\nvirtually ensures the protection of its nationals and \r\nfurther provides protection against impunity and the \r\nperpetrators of heinous crimes.\r\nMr. Mansour (Palestine): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC), Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, for \r\nher report to the General Assembly (see A/72/349). I \r\nwould also like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the ICC (A/72/PV.342). The State of Palestine \r\nwelcomes the crucial support of the United Nations for, \r\nand cooperation with, the ICC as well as the ideas put \r\nforward to further that cooperation, including through \r\nregular exchanges between the Court and the Security \r\nCouncil on the ongoing crimes being examined by \r\nthe Court.\r\nThere can be no doubt that robust international \r\njustice is indispensable to international peace and \r\nsecurity. Born in reaction to the horrors of our \r\ncentury — from the Second World War and the \r\nHolocaust to the genocides in Rwanda and the former \r\nYugoslavia — the International Criminal Court is \r\nhumankind’s pledge to prevent the recurrence of such \r\natrocities. The ICC is the embodiment of our belief that \r\nthere are crimes for which there can be no immunity and \r\nthat it is the common responsibility of all humankind \r\nto hold those who commit such crimes accountable if \r\nStates are unwilling or unable to do so. As such, the \r\nuniversality of the Court is of the utmost importance, \r\nand in that regard we welcome the decisions of both \r\nSouth Africa and the Gambia to reverse their decisions \r\nto withdraw from the Court. We call on all States to \r\njoin the ICC to fulfil the long-overdue promise of a \r\nuniversal Court that would ensure that atrocity crimes \r\ndo not go unpunished.\r\nThe States parties to the ICC therefore have a duty \r\nnot to delay any further the granting of jurisdiction \r\nto the Court over the worst form of the illegal use of \r\nforce, the crime of aggression. The suppression of \r\nacts of aggression is of such importance that it stands \r\namong the purposes of the United Nations enshrined in \r\nArticle 1 of the Charter. As long as we are not willing to \r\nhold accountable those responsible for the commission \r\nof the crime of aggression, we will be failing in our \r\nresponsibility to help prevent such crimes in the future.\r\nThe State of Palestine had the honour to be the \r\nthirtieth State to ratify the amendment on the crime \r\nof aggression, thereby helping to fulfil one of the two \r\ncriteria for the activation of the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nover that crime. At the upcoming session of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties of the ICC, and 20 years \r\nafter the adoption of the Rome Statute, States parties \r\nwill have an opportunity and the responsibility to \r\nactivate the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction over the \r\ncrime of aggression. They must do so in a way that is \r\nfully consistent with the letter and spirit of the Kampala \r\ncompromise, which includes specific provisions \r\nregarding the jurisdiction of the Court in relation to \r\nthe crime of aggression. States parties also must not \r\nattempt to further restrict the jurisdiction of the Court \r\nin relation to this most serious crime.\r\nThe State of Palestine has pledged its full \r\ncooperation with the Court and acted accordingly since \r\nit joined the ICC. It submitted a declaration accepting \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction over the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including Jerusalem, which led to the opening \r\nby the Prosecutor of a preliminary examination of the \r\nsituation in the State of Palestine. The State of Palestine \r\nsubmitted extensive communications to the Court with \r\nrespect to the crimes committed by Israeli officials \r\nin relation to illegal settlements and their associated \r\nregime and the attacks against the civilian population, \r\nnotably in the Gaza Strip during the summer of 2014.\r\nPalestine has the utmost respect for the independence \r\nof the Court. However, it is clear that all Courts have \r\nan obligation to ensure justice is neither delayed nor \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.37\r\n17-35526 21/25\r\ndenied. The ICC has a heightened responsibility in \r\nsituations where crimes are ongoing so as to prevent \r\ntheir recurrence. In the past three years, during \r\nwhich the preliminary examination in the situation in \r\nPalestine has been under way, Israel has intensified the \r\npace of its crimes, notably in relation to settlements. \r\nIsraeli leaders have confessed not only to being aware \r\nof the existence of such crimes, but also to their intent \r\nto commit them and to continue doing so relentlessly, as \r\ndemonstrated in 2017, when settlement announcements \r\nhave more than tripled compared to 2016.\r\nGiven the overwhelming prima facie evidence of the \r\ncommission of crimes by Israeli officials in Palestine, \r\nand given that those crimes are among the most \r\ndocumented in recent history, and taking into account \r\ntheir recurrence and intensification, their gravity, their \r\nimpact on international peace and security and their \r\nlink to both colonialism and apartheid, two of the \r\nmost condemned phenomena under international law, \r\nincluding international criminal law, Palestine remains \r\nan important test for the credibility of the Court, a \r\ntest that the Court cannot afford to fail. We also call \r\non the Prosecutor to ensure that the language used by \r\nher Office does not depart from the legal language \r\ngrounded in all relevant instruments of international \r\nlaw, while avoiding language that could be seen as \r\nrooted in political considerations.\r\nOn the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court, the State of Palestine stresses that the \r\nestablishment of the ICC was a historic step towards \r\nentrenching the international rule of law. Preserving \r\nand empowering the Court is of the utmost importance \r\nto ensure protection for future generations and to fulfil \r\nthe purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe all have a responsibility to address the \r\ndiscrepancy between the vital mandate of the ICC and \r\nits too-limited resources. Palestine also underlines the \r\nimportant role of civil society and calls on host States \r\nand other States to act decisively in addressing any \r\nthreats against organizations or persons cooperating \r\nwith the Court.\r\nFinally, the State of Palestine declares its solidarity \r\nwith all victims of atrocities, and it pledges to support \r\nthe Court in its endeavour to ensure justice for those \r\nvictims and save others from such atrocities. The \r\nuniversality and efficiency of the ICC are paramount if \r\nwe are to honour our commitment to those victims and \r\nthe cause of justice and humanity.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/72/L.3.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to the speaker in explanation \r\nof position before action is taken on the draft resolution, \r\nmay I remind delegations that explanations of position \r\nare limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Sudan.\r\nMr. Ahmed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation reaffirms its commitment to fighting \r\nimpunity and to the administration of justice through \r\nnational judicial bodies that are capable and competent \r\nand in a position to uphold their national jurisdictions \r\nand administer justice at the national level. That is \r\nthe responsibility of national jurisdictions, without \r\ninterference or custodianship by any external party. For \r\nthat reason, we clearly and utterly reject any dealings \r\nwith the International Criminal Court (ICC).\r\nThe Sudan is not a State party to the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich established the ICC, or the Court itself. We also \r\nreaffirm that we have no obligation to either pursuant \r\nto the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. \r\nFurthermore, we consider the ongoing attempts by \r\nsome States parties to the Rome Statute to make the \r\nGeneral Assembly an Assembly of States Parties to that \r\nStatute to be unlawful. The Court is a separate entity; \r\nit does not enjoy any organic relationship with the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe obligations of States parties in no way involve \r\nStates non-parties. Therefore, draft resolution A/72/L.3 \r\nhas no bearing on the Sudan, and, when adopted, it will \r\nbe given no consideration whatsoever by the Sudan.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of position before action is taken \r\non the draft resolution.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/72/L.3, entitled “Report of the International \r\nCriminal Court”. For the Assembly’s information, the \r\ndraft resolution has been closed to e-sponsorship.\r\nA/72/PV.37 30/10/2017\r\n22/25 17-35526\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to \r\nannounce that, since the submission of draft resolution \r\nA/72/L.3, and in addition to those delegations listed \r\nin the document, the following countries have also \r\nbecome sponsors of the draft resolution: Albania, \r\nAndorra, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin, Brazil, \r\nBulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Ecuador, \r\nEl Salvador, France, Georgia, Ghana, Greece, Hungary, \r\nIreland, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Montenegro, \r\nPanama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, Romania, Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nSan Marino, Senegal, Tunisia, Uganda, Ukraine, the \r\nUnited Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu and the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly wishes to adopt draft resolution A/72/L.3?\r\nDraft resolution A/72/L.3 was adopted (resolution \r\n72/3).\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor to \r\nthe speaker in explanation of position following the \r\nadoption of resolution 72/3, may I remind delegations \r\nthat explanations of position are limited to 10 minutes \r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Musikhin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian delegation is committed to the \r\ninternational rule of law and to fighting impunity. As \r\npart of the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals, our country \r\nwas present at the birth of international criminal justice. \r\nUnfortunately, since the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) started its work, it has not shown itself to be a \r\nworthy successor to those two tribunals by living up to \r\nthe importance of that endeavour.\r\nOnce more, we are disappointed that the text of \r\nthe draft resolution on the report of the International \r\nCriminal Court, just adopted as resolution 72/3, was \r\nyet again updated with nothing more than technical \r\namendments. We consider it high time to change the \r\napproaches used to draft it. The document should fully \r\nreflect the positions of the States that are non-parties \r\nto the Rome Statute of the ICC. The resolution has \r\nturned into an artificially preserved selection of hopes \r\nand aspirations that the international community has \r\nimposed on the new judicial body since its establishment. \r\nThere is a need to recognize that they do not mirror the \r\nde facto situation, both within and around the Court.\r\nWe have expressed our vision of the work of the \r\nICC on several occasions. Unfortunately, last year did \r\nnot give us any grounds to reconsider that evaluation. \r\nFor example, with respect to some of the sentences \r\nissued during the fifteenth year of the ICC, enormous \r\nresources had to be spent, and the effectiveness of \r\nthe Court has been demonstrated in only one case: \r\nin 2011, the Court granted swift legal support for the \r\nbombing of Libya. But when reporting on the issue of \r\ncivilian victims of the NATO bombing of Libya, the \r\nICC Prosecutor stated that nothing had been done to \r\ninvestigate the crimes allegedly committed by the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant.\r\nThe Court continues to ignore the norms of \r\ncustomary international law on the immunity of officials \r\nof States that are non-parties to the Rome Statute. As \r\na result, well-known concerns have been shared by a \r\nnumber of States in Africa and by the African Union, \r\nand we share those concerns. It is symbolic that they \r\nrecently gave rise to the first official withdrawal of a \r\nState from the Rome Statute of the ICC.\r\nWe agree with the assessments voiced here, both in \r\nthe past and throughout this year, regarding the double \r\nstandards, selectivity and politicization that the ICC \r\nallows in its work. It is not surprising that, in the light \r\nof this nature of the Court’s work, the Ukrainian and \r\nGeorgian delegations decided to abuse the rostrum of \r\nthe General Assembly to voice their usual allegations. \r\nThe position of Russia with respect to the work of \r\nthe ICC, specifically on Ukraine and Georgia, is well \r\nknown, and I will not repeat it.\r\nThe reputation of the Court is undoubtedly \r\ndeteriorating. We have drawn attention to this month’s \r\ninformation in the media about abuses that were \r\nallowed by current and former staff members of the \r\nProsecutor’s Office, including the former Prosecutor of \r\nthe ICC during the investigation of the Libyan issue. We \r\nwould further like to point out the inadequate reaction \r\nof the Court on that issue.\r\nIn conclusion, there are many problems facing the \r\nCourt; we will not list all of them. However, the main \r\npoints are as follows: there is not even a single situation \r\nthat we can recall where the ICC truly facilitated \r\nstabilization, the curbing of violence or improvement of \r\nthe situation for the population. Particularly indicative \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.37\r\n17-35526 23/25\r\nin that regard are the many years of work on cases \r\nreferred to the Court by the Security Council.\r\nIn the light of what I have said here, our delegation \r\ncould not support the technical update of the text and \r\ndissociates itself from the consensus on resolution 72/3.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of position following the \r\nadoption of resolution 72/3.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in exercise \r\nof the right of reply, may I remind members that \r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited \r\nto 10 minutes for the first statement and to five minutes \r\nfor the second, and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Ahmed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): We would \r\nlike to make this statement in exercise of our right of \r\nreply to the statement of the representative of Estonia, \r\nwhich was audacious enough to mention the Sudan \r\nand His Excellency President Al-Bashir. It is rather \r\nshocking to consider that the representative of Estonia \r\nworks in diplomacy, as he mentioned our President’s \r\nname without giving his title. I would remind him that \r\nthe Sudan was one of the first sub-Saharan States to \r\ngain independence in Africa.\r\nWith regard to the relationship between the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and the Security Council, \r\nit is just political and has nothing to do with justice. \r\nIt is an example of the use of selectivity and double \r\nstandards, which implies an effort to undermine the \r\npolitical independence and integrity of the Sudan. I am \r\nsure that the representative of Estonia is aware of this \r\nand of all the different related aspects.\r\nThe representative of Estonia’s statement was \r\nunacceptable and runs counter to diplomatic custom. \r\nIn his statement, he attacked the Sudan, its people, \r\nits Government and its President. Estonia appears to \r\nbe speaking on behalf of the International Criminal \r\nCourt and is taking the place of some administrator \r\nof international justice. I think that Estonia should \r\nreally focus on its own domestic issues without giving \r\nsermons to anyone else. Indeed, it is only Africa that \r\nis the subject of these sermons. When we look at the \r\nsituation in other parts of the world, it is silence that \r\nprevails, as if those countries are beyond criticism \r\nwhen it comes to justice.\r\nWe are not a State party to the ICC. We have no \r\nobligation whatsoever to the Court, in line with the \r\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. We are \r\nconcerned about the fight against impunity. We want \r\nto achieve justice as a noble objective, but without \r\npoliticization, selectivity or subordination to other \r\nPowers. My country therefore expresses its rejection \r\nand condemnation of the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Estonia.\r\nMr. Maung (Myanmar): My delegation takes the \r\nf loor in exercise of the right of reply to respond to the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Bangladesh.\r\nThe Government of Myanmar is committed \r\nto a sustainable solution for peace, stability and \r\ndevelopment for all communities within Rakhine \r\nstate. The Government of Myanmar is determined to \r\nimplement the commitments we made to working until \r\nprogress and success have been achieved. Rather than \r\nrebutting criticism and allegations with words, we will \r\nshow the world our true intentions by our actions and \r\ndeeds. Since 25 August, when the terrorist attack took \r\nplace in northern Rakhine state, we have many positive \r\ndevelopments there. Some of the more significant ones \r\nare the following.\r\nThe Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, led by \r\nformer United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, \r\ndelivered its final report on 24 August. The Government \r\nhas given the report its sincere consideration with a \r\nview to carrying out the recommendations as to the \r\nsituation on the ground to the fullest extent and within \r\nthe shortest time frame possible. A Ministry of Labour \r\ncommittee has been established to ensure that the \r\nrecommendations are implemented expeditiously, and \r\nan advisory group, including three eminent figures \r\nfrom different regions of the world, will also soon \r\nbe established.\r\nWith regard to the current humanitarian situation \r\nin Rakhine state, the Government has identified \r\nthree main tasks to be undertaken promptly, namely, \r\nrepatriation and the provision of humanitarian \r\nassistance to returnees, resettlement and rehabilitation \r\nof all displaced communities, and the establishment \r\nof sustainable peace, stability and development in \r\nRakhine state. To implement the tasks, the Office of \r\nthe Union Enterprise for Humanitarian Assistance, \r\nResettlement and Development in Rakhine was \r\nlaunched on 15 October. This is a partnership among \r\nthe Government, the people, the private sector, \r\nlocal non-governmental organizations and civil-\r\nsociety organizations, development partners, United \r\nA/72/PV.37 30/10/2017\r\n24/25 17-35526\r\nNations agencies and international non-governmental \r\norganizations. On 17 October, the Committee for the \r\nUnion Enterprise, chaired by the State Counsellor, was \r\nestablished in order to oversee the operation of the \r\nEnterprise. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\nCoordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance \r\non Disaster Management is now working with the \r\nGovernment of Myanmar to deliver humanitarian \r\nassistance to all displaced persons.\r\nMyanmar is collaborating with donor countries of \r\nthe International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement \r\nto provide assistance expeditiously and in accordance \r\nwith humanitarian principles. We continue to maintain \r\nour cooperation with the United Nations. The Under-\r\nSecretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Jeffrey \r\nFeltman, recently visited Myanmar and met with the \r\nleadership of the country. He also had the opportunity \r\nto see first-hand the situation on the ground in Rakhine \r\nstate. We are also harvesting the paddy fields that were \r\nabandoned by those taking refuge in Bangladesh. We \r\nhave asked the World Food Programme and the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to \r\nassist in harvesting, drying and providing storage for \r\nthe paddy fields. The fields will be kept for refugees \r\nin their names so that they can claim them upon \r\ntheir return.\r\nThe Myanmar and Bangladesh authorities are \r\nworking on the voluntary, safe and dignified return of \r\ndisplaced persons on the basis of the 1993 agreement \r\nbetween the two countries. A delegation headed by the \r\nMinister for Home Affairs of Bangladesh was recently \r\nin Myanmar for discussions on the issue of repatriation \r\nand border security cooperation. During this visit, two \r\nmemorandums of understanding on the establishment \r\nof border liaison posts and security, cooperation and \r\ndialogue were signed. Other bilateral engagements \r\nare ongoing.\r\nWe have beenquite surprised to witness Bangladesh’s \r\napproach to the issue within United Nations forum. This \r\nleads me, therefore, to question whether the Bangladesh \r\ndelegation has the genuine desire to solve the issue \r\nrather than to enflame it. The challenges we face in \r\nfinding a sustainable solution on the issue of Rakhine \r\nstate cannot be overcome overnight. The sincere and \r\ngenuine cooperation of the international community is \r\ncrucial. No one can fully understand the situation of \r\nour country the way we do, and no one desires peace \r\nand development for our country more than we do. We \r\nwish for all interested parties to be part of the solution, \r\nnot part of the problem.\r\nMr. Al Arsan (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, my delegation disassociates \r\nitself from any consensus regarding resolution 72/3, \r\nentitled “Report of the International Criminal Court”.\r\nI recall that the Syrian Arab Republic was one \r\nof the first countries to actively contribute to the \r\nnegotiations on the Rome Statute, establishing the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), and one of its \r\nfirst signatories. However, in the face of the outcomes \r\nof the Court’s selective implementation of the notion \r\nof justice, my country, Syria, decided to disassociate \r\nitself from that body, which has become a deficient \r\nand biased institution that undermines the noble \r\nnotion of justice and serves the whims and interests \r\nof certain countries, ultimately evolving into a tool \r\nto undermine international relations, the principles of \r\ninternational law and the purposes of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn their statements today, some delegations have \r\ntouched on the situation in my country and raised \r\nissues that are irrelevant to the item under discussion \r\ntoday. They have called for so-called justice and an end \r\nto impunity in Syria through referral of the situation in \r\nSyria to the ICC and by asking the State to cooperate \r\nwith the so-called International, Impartial and \r\nIndependent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation \r\nand Prosecution of Those Responsible for the Most \r\nSerious Crimes under International Law Committed \r\nin the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011. The \r\nstatements I allude to — I refer in particular to those \r\nmade by the representatives of Denmark and the United \r\nStates — ignored the substantive criticism that we have \r\nheard in the past and again today from some countries \r\nabout the ICC and its deliberately deficient mandate, \r\nwhich is limited to certain countries and issues. Today, \r\nthose countries ignored the specific reasons that \r\ncompelled some States to withdraw from the Rome \r\nStatute and the Court.\r\n The political hypocrisy that we continue to see \r\ntoday is manifested in statements of some Governments \r\nconcerning international justice and calling for the \r\nimplementation of a virtual ICC mandate on the \r\nsituation in Syria, whereas those same countries have \r\nsigned bilateral agreements with the Government of \r\nthe United States of America in order to give United \r\nStates soldiers immunity from prosecution before the \r\n30/10/2017 A/72/PV.37\r\n17-35526 25/25\r\nICC. As members are aware, ever since the signing \r\nof the Rome Statute and the establishment of the \r\nCourt, the United States has made diplomatic efforts \r\nto reach bilateral agreements with other States, giving \r\nimmunity to United States soldiers. This has resulted \r\nin the achievement of many bilateral agreements to \r\ngrant such immunity to United States soldiers. We are \r\nsorry to hear representatives in many forums, including \r\nthe Assembly today, speak of referring the situation in \r\nSyria to the ICC, while their own countries have signed \r\nbilateral agreements with the United States to grant \r\nimmunity to the soldiers of the United States army \r\nunder the mandate of the Court.\r\nAs for the International, Impartial and Independent \r\nMechanism, the Syrian Arab Republic and other \r\nMember States refuse to recognize the Mechanism or \r\nany mandate thereof, as it only reflects the distortion \r\nof the notion of universal jurisdiction and abuses that \r\njurisdiction in the General Assembly. It is a grave \r\nviolation of the provisions of Articles 2 and 12 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the provisions of \r\nothers that specify the powers of the General Assembly.\r\nI wish to cite here an example of a grave legal \r\nbreach in the establishment of the Mechanism, which \r\nwas granted powers and authorities that belong mainly \r\nto the national prosecutory and judicial bodies of each \r\ncountry. The Charter of the United Nations grants the \r\nGeneral Assembly no power or authority related to \r\nprosecution or criminal investigations. Consequently, \r\nthe General Assembly does not have the mandate to \r\nestablish a body that enjoys powers and authorities that \r\nthe General Assembly itself does not enjoy, let alone to \r\nestablish such a Mechanism. Such authority is enjoyed \r\nexclusively by the Security Council.\r\nOnce again, I call on all members of the Assembly \r\nto read document A/71/799, which contains the \r\ntext of a letter from the Chargé d’affaires a.i. of the \r\nPermanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic to \r\nthe Secretary-General, highlighting the grave legal \r\nbreaches in resolution 71/248, which established the \r\nillegal Mechanism. Syria calls on Member States to \r\ndisassociate themselves from the Mechanism and to \r\nrefrain from providing it with support or finance, given \r\nthe fact that 80 per cent of its funding is provided by \r\nthe Government of a State that does not recognize the \r\nUnited Nations designation of the Al-Nusra Front as a \r\nterrorist body and that continues to finance and arm the \r\nAl-Nusra Front. Therefore, a mechanism that is being \r\nfunded by the same source that finances terrorism \r\ncannot be international, impartial or independent. It is \r\na distortion of the notion of universal jurisdiction.\r\nIt is no longer acceptable for the Governments \r\nof certain States to use justice — one of the noble \r\npurposes of humankind — as a tool to interfere with the \r\ninternal affairs of other States. It is no longer acceptable \r\nfor justice to be a mere tool for the most powerful \r\nto exercise their power over the weak. We therefore \r\ncall on the Governments that frequently speak about \r\nimpunity to back up their words with actions and to hold \r\ntheir country’s officials accountable for sponsoring, \r\nfacilitating and financing the transfer of thousands of \r\nforeign terrorist fighters to my country, Syria. Everyone \r\nbelieves, perhaps only implicitly, that the influx of tens \r\nof thousands of those foreign terrorist fighters into \r\nSyria and Iraq was the result not of individual efforts, \r\nbut rather of a well-organized scheme that operated for \r\nyears. The Governments and intelligence services of \r\nmany countries are implicated therein.\r\nWe also call on the Governments that speak out \r\nagainst impunity to hold to account the forces of the \r\ninternational coalition in Syria, led by the United \r\nStates, which have used internationally prohibited \r\nweapons in Syria, including white phosphorus, killing \r\nthousands of civilians. They have bombed schools, \r\nbridges, infrastructure, power plants and water plants, \r\nand destroyed the city of Raqqa. With the help of \r\nsupporting militia, they levelled the city and declared \r\nvictory over the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham \r\n(ISIS). The result was that the international coalition \r\nforces and their supporting militia struck a deal with \r\nISIS whereby its fighters were moved from Raqqa to \r\nDeir ez-Zor in order to obstruct the operations of the \r\nSyrian Arab Army and its allies.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 76?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.45 p.m.\r\n"
