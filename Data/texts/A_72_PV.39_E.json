"United Nations A/72/PV.39\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n39th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 1 November 2017, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Llorentty Solíz \r\n(Plurinational State of Bolivia), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 42 (continued)\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/72/94)\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): It is a great honour to take the f loor when you, \r\nSir, are presiding over the General Assembly. \r\nArgentina welcomes the condolences and displays \r\nof solidarity regarding the attack in New York yesterday. \r\nWe express our condolences to all the victims — five \r\nof whom were Argentines — including citizens of \r\nBelgium and the United States. Argentina reaffirms its \r\nstrong condemnation of terrorist attacks and violence in \r\nall its manifestations. We reiterate the need to increase \r\nthe fight against that scourge. \r\nI will now move on to the issue at hand. At the \r\noutset, I wish to welcome the presence today of \r\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba, and to thank him for his very detailed \r\nstatement this morning (see A/72/PV.38). \r\nArgentina fully aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representative of Ecuador, on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, and by the representative \r\nof El Salvador, on behalf of the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States (see A/72/PV.38), and \r\nwishes to make the following points in our national \r\ncapacity.\r\nArgentina’s historical position has been that \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba must be \r\nurgently lifted and is contrary to international law, in \r\nparticular to the principles of the sovereign equality of \r\nStates, non-interference in internal affairs, freedom of \r\ncommerce and international navigation and the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes.\r\nWithin the framework of our absolute commitment \r\nto the Charter of the United Nations and to \r\nmultilateralism, Argentina opposes the use of unilateral \r\ncoercive measures, the extraterritorial implementation \r\nof national laws and the adoption of discriminatory \r\ncommercial practices. In this regard, Argentina has \r\ntraditionally supported resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly against the embargo and has spoken against \r\nit whenever the subject has arisen, in both regional \r\nforums and other international organizations.\r\nThe Government of Argentina welcomed the \r\nprocess initiated by the Governments of Cuba and the \r\nUnited States at the end of 2014 to normalize bilateral \r\nrelations. While we welcomed the executive orders \r\nimplemented by the United States Department of the \r\nTreasury and the Department of Commerce in 2015 and \r\n2016, which introduced amendments to regulations on \r\nthe subject, we note with concern that they contrast with \r\nthose announced on 16 June 2017 that reverse some of \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org).

Their implementation \r\ncontinues to impede the full development of the \r\nCuban people. The adoption of resolution 72/4 by a \r\nlarge majority reaffirms the unequivocal message of \r\nthe international community that the embargo against \r\nCuba must be lifted. Argentina reaffirms its conviction \r\nthat a dialogue without preconditions between both \r\nparties that involves the mutual recognition of both \r\nGovernments as legitimate and equal interlocutors will \r\nresolve all pending problems between the United States \r\nand Cuba, including the lifting of the embargo.\r\nMr. Kamau (Kenya): Kenya would like to align \r\nitself with the statements made earlier this morning by \r\nthe representative of Ecuador, on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China; the representative of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela, on behalf of  the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement; and the representative of Gabon, on behalf \r\nof the Group of African States (see A/72/PV.38).\r\nKenya has always believed that sanctions and \r\nblockades are a crude and irresponsible instrument \r\nof unilateral or collective international action \r\nand diplomacy. Our twenty-first-century global \r\ncivilization should never condone the use of such \r\ncrude and indiscriminate instruments for international \r\ndiplomacy as unilateral sanctions or blockades. Sadly, \r\nunilateral sanctions and blockades continue to attract \r\nthe attention of the powerful and the dominant. Let \r\nus be clear — such sanctions and blockades are \r\nprejudicial and purely politically self-serving. They \r\nserve no multilateral purpose and, in fact, frustrate \r\nand undermine multilateral solutions. Furthermore, as \r\nwe have seen, more often than not, sanctions serve to \r\nentrench those whom they ostensibly target.\r\nAs we all know, tragically and inevitably, in the \r\nlong run sanctions and blockades are unsustainable \r\nand poorly enforceable. Moreover, the suffering and \r\npain they cause rarely, if ever, justify the perceived \r\ninjustice that motivated their initial application. If truth \r\nbe told, only the unilateral enforcer takes any political \r\ncapital and satisfaction from unilateral sanctions and/or \r\nblockades, but little else. At best, sanctions expose the \r\nvulnerability of those subjected to them, who are, for \r\nthe most part, the poor and the defenceless. The United \r\nNations is a body that needs to hold itself to a higher \r\nideal than that which condones the crude choice and \r\nuse of untargeted, horizonless unilateral sanctions and \r\nblockades.\r\nThe United Nations should hold itself up to an ideal \r\nthat does not demonstrate implicitly that a Member State \r\nwith overwhelming power can be a unilateral enforcer \r\nof sanctions or blockades. Indeed, what the United \r\nNations holds itself up to should be an ideal that should \r\nnever demonstrate that the weak can suffer sanctions \r\nor blockades without recourse and almost without end. \r\nThose conditions are already true and met before \r\nunilateral sanctions or blockades by a powerful entity \r\nare selected and implemented. Moreover, the United \r\nNations should never uphold any sanctions or blockades \r\nthat do not meet the threshold of precision and swift \r\nand determinative action. Neither should sanctions and \r\nblockades be prejudicial to and discriminatory against \r\na Member State simply because that Member State does \r\nnot adhere to the cultural values or political ideals of \r\nanother Member State or a group of Member States.\r\nIn the case of the tragic and seemingly perennial \r\nunilateral sanctions and blockade levelled against the \r\nRepublic of Cuba, it seems to my delegation that history \r\nhas become our political and diplomatic prisoner. \r\nSurely we know better. We need not be consumed by \r\nhabit or our political imperatives. Why must we allow \r\nour historical habit to become a determinant of our \r\ncurrent action? That would be truly tragic.\r\nWe all know that the point of the unilateral sanctions \r\nand blockade against Cuba has already been made many \r\ntimes over throughout the years. Last year, in this very \r\nHall, the enforcer of those sanctions acknowledged that \r\nthey and the blockade finally needed to be lifted. Some \r\n191 Member States agreed by voting for resolution \r\n71/5 last year. My delegation believes that the time to \r\nend the sanctions and blockade against Cuba is indeed \r\nlong past. Let the people of Cuba be free to join the \r\ncollective of international citizenry and enjoy the same \r\nunhindered social, economic and political freedoms \r\nthat the rest of us enjoy. Let us not let sanctions and \r\nblockades —  unilateral or otherwise — stand in their \r\nway. Let us not let sanctions become the instrument that \r\nwe or anyone else uses to leave Cuba behind. It is for \r\nthose reasons that Kenya voted in favour of resolution \r\n72/4.\r\nMr. Mounzer (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representative of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela, on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\n01/11/2017 A/72/PV.39\r\n17-35997 3/12\r\nCountries, and by the representative of the Republic of \r\nEcuador, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China (see \r\nA/72/PV.38).\r\nWe wish to present the following explanation of \r\nvote in our national capacity. We welcome the presence \r\nof Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba, a friendly country, and we reaffirm \r\nSyria’s support for the Government and our friends, \r\nthe people of Cuba, as they confront the decades-long, \r\nunjust embargo imposed by the United States. \r\nWe also congratulate Cuba on the significant \r\ndiplomatic victory achieved today, which reflects the \r\ninternational community’s rejection of the injustice \r\nthat Cuba has suffered for 55 years. It is also a clear \r\nillustration of the lack of regard that the United States \r\nhas for international law and of its stubbornness in \r\nimplementing barbaric policies involving embargoes, \r\npunishments and unilateral coercive and economic \r\nmeasures against States that refuse to become its \r\nsatellites and accept its dictates, while defending their \r\nindependence and national sovereignty.\r\nThe international community had optimistically \r\nwelcomed the previous United States Administration’s \r\npolicy concerning Cuba, as it believed that it might one \r\nday lead to a lifting of the unjust embargo against the \r\nCuban people. The current American Administration \r\nhas shown once again that the political doctrine of the \r\nestablishment in power in the United States is incapable \r\nof changing and that it will continue to act based on \r\nthe logic of the primacy of military force and economic \r\ninfluence with a view to imposing its hegemony \r\nthroughout the entire world, breaking the will of free \r\ncountries and bringing freedom- and dignity-loving \r\npeople to their knees.\r\nSuch unilateral coercive economic measures \r\nconstitute a collective punishment imposed on an \r\nentire population. They undermine the United Nations \r\nsystem and impede it from carrying out its legitimate \r\nmandates. Furthermore, they pose a major obstacle \r\nto the achievement of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. They also hinder trade \r\noperations and the enjoyment of human rights. The \r\nGovernments of Member States that resort to illegal \r\nblockades and unilateral coercive economic measures \r\nmust begin to understand that those unjust policies \r\nhave only led to the rejection of the West. They provide \r\nextremist and terrorist movements with a new weapon \r\nfor recruiting from among the weak, who are the most \r\naffected by such illegal unilateral measures, thereby \r\nincreasing tensions in international relations and \r\nthreatening international peace and security.\r\nFor  those reasons, the Syrian Arab Republic voted \r\nin favour of resolution 72/4. Syria calls on the General \r\nAssembly to act in accordance with the provisions \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nas well as its own relevant resolutions, with a view \r\nto implementing effective mechanisms to end such \r\naggressive practices, policies involving embargoes, \r\nand unilateral economic measures, which run contrary \r\nto international law. Moreover, my country calls for \r\nthe implementation of sound mechanisms that would \r\nhold accountable Member States that resort to illegal \r\neconomic embargoes, which, owing to their political, \r\nfinancial and legal repercussions, have disastrous \r\nconsequences for the economies of the countries \r\ntargeted by such embargoes. The latter paralyse and \r\ndestroy sensitive economic sectors that provide for \r\nthe basic needs of the population, namely, health \r\ncare, education, nutrition, agriculture, industry, trade, \r\ntechnology and communications.\r\nMy country demands that the blockade imposed by \r\nthe United States of America be lifted. We also demand \r\nan end to unilateral measures imposed by the United \r\nStates of America, the European Union and other \r\nStates against many other Member States, including \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic. Such unilateral coercive \r\nand aggressive measures are preventing Syrians from \r\naccessing basic services, such as food, medicine, \r\neducation, and medical, agricultural and industrial \r\nequipment, as well as spare parts for civil aviation \r\nand telecommunications equipment. Such measures \r\nconstitute a major human rights violation and have led \r\nto huge losses for the economy, thereby undermining \r\nefforts to combat terrorism.\r\nIn conclusion, one question remains unanswered: \r\nhow can the Governments of some Member States \r\nreconcile their statements delivered in this Hall in \r\nwhich they call for the rejection of the embargo imposed \r\nagainst Cuba and other States with their policies aimed \r\nat putting humanitarian, economic and social pressure \r\non various other nations through the use of illegal \r\neconomic embargoes against the peoples which I just \r\nmentioned.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): My \r\ndelegation strongly condemns the heinous act of \r\nA/72/PV.39 01/11/2017\r\n4/12 17-35997\r\nterrorism that took place yesterday in New York City \r\nand expresses its condolences and sympathy to the \r\nfamilies of all of the victims.\r\nI shall now present the Assembly with the following \r\nexplanation of vote on resolution 72/4.\r\nThe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba runs counter to the principles of \r\ninternational law governing relations among States and \r\ncontradicts the letter and spirit of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, which calls for promoting solidarity, \r\ncooperation and friendly relations among nations, and \r\nfor the resolution of disputes and problems among \r\ncountries through peaceful means and dialogue, based \r\non equality and mutual respect for the sovereignty of \r\nMember States.\r\nThe decades-long embargo has seriously \r\njeopardized the legitimate rights and interests of Cuba \r\nand other States, as well as the freedom of trade and \r\nnavigation, and serves no other purpose than to inflict \r\ntremendous hardship and suffering on the people of \r\nCuba, especially women and children. It must therefore \r\nbe lifted immediately, as requested by the General \r\nAssembly in all relevant resolutions, including the one \r\njust adopted today (resolution 72/4).\r\nFurthermore, inasmuch as the international \r\ncommunity faces major challenges such as food crises, \r\nincreased poverty, unemployment and malnutrition, the \r\nimposition of the embargo seems more unjustifiable and \r\ninhumane than ever and deserves stronger objections \r\nat the international level. Additionally, the adoption \r\nof General Assembly resolutions on the subject over \r\nthe course of so many years — and with such a wide \r\nrange of support — indicates the strong objection of \r\nthe international community to unilateral economic \r\ncoercive measures in general and to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed against \r\nCuba in particular. Calls to put an end to that unlawful \r\nand inhumane embargo are a sign of increasing \r\nsympathy for the Government and the people of Cuba.\r\nCuba is not the only country that is suffering \r\nfrom United States sanctions. Unjustified sanctions \r\nintroduced or imposed under various false pretexts by \r\nthe United States against the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nover the past four decades — even after the agreement \r\non the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and its \r\nendorsement by the Security Council — continue to \r\ntarget innocent people and obstruct their basic rights. \r\nRegrettably, unilateral coercive measures have become \r\na consistent element of the policies of the United States, \r\neven where a Security Council resolution has clearly \r\nprohibited it.\r\nConsidering the fact that such unilateral sanctions \r\nare contrary to the principles of international law, \r\nthe sovereign equality of States, non-interference in \r\ntheir internal affairs and peaceful coexistence among \r\nthem, the Islamic Republic of Iran remains opposed \r\nto the application of unilateral economic and trade \r\nmeasures by the United States of America against other \r\ncountries. We are also opposed to the extraterritorial \r\napplication and effects of such national legislation on \r\nthe sovereignty of other States and on free trade among \r\nnations. We emphasize the urgent need to put an end \r\nto such erroneous policies and measures, as well as the \r\nneed to ensure the full implementation of the provisions \r\nof the relevant General Assembly resolutions, including \r\nresolution 72/4, adopted today.\r\nMr. Gimolieca (Angola): Our delegation also \r\naligns itself with the statements of other delegations in \r\nstrongly condemning the terrorist attack yesterday in \r\ndowntown Manhattan. We express our condolences to \r\nthe families of the victims and wish those who were \r\ninjured a speedy recovery.\r\nAllow me to begin by extending a word of welcome \r\nto His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba. The Republic of \r\nAngola associates itself with the statements made by \r\nthe representative of Gabon, on behalf of the Group \r\nof African States; the representative of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela, on behalf of the Movement \r\nof Non-Aligned Countries; and the representative of \r\nEcuador, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China (see \r\nA/72/PV.38).\r\nAngola voted in favour of resolution 72/4, \r\nadopted today by the Assembly, because it considers \r\nthe persistence of the unjust and severe economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo, unilaterally \r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba for more than \r\n55 years, to be a retrograde measure inflicting severe \r\ndamage on the Cuban people, especially those that are \r\nmost vulnerable. Angola expected the normalization \r\nof diplomatic relations between the two countries to \r\nencourage the American authorities to take further \r\nmeasures towards putting an end to the embargo and \r\nto show respect for the Cuban people, who have freely \r\nexercised their right to decide on their own political \r\n01/11/2017 A/72/PV.39\r\n17-35997 5/12\r\nand economic system in order to ensure the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the island.\r\nThe extraterritorial nature of the embargo is \r\nreflected in the financial persecution directed against \r\ncertain other countries’ banks and the imposition \r\nof new fines on institutions for violating the rules \r\nimposed by the United States Government with regard \r\nto Cuba. That causes severe obstacles to the economic, \r\ncultural and social development of the island and has \r\na significant negative impact on several sensitive \r\nsectors such as public health, which severely affects \r\nthe well-being of the Cuban people. In that context, we \r\nregret the measures announced by the current Trump \r\nAdministration that impose additional obstacles on the \r\nalready limited trade opportunities between Cuba and \r\nthe United States.\r\nAngola reaffirms its commitment to respecting, \r\npreserving and promoting the principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the provisions of international \r\nlaw, which provide for access to multilateralism and to \r\ncollective efforts to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity, economic growth and respect for human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms. My country recognizes \r\nand once again congratulates the Secretary-General \r\non his efforts aimed at ending the economic, trade \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States \r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nIn that connection, Angola reiterates its \r\nunconditional support for the implementation of \r\nthe recommendations contained in resolution 71/5, \r\nof 26 October 2016, on the topic before us today. I \r\ntake this opportunity to appeal once again to the \r\ninternational community to renew its efforts to promote \r\na constructive and transparent dialogue between the \r\ntwo countries in order to achieve the objectives set out \r\nin relevant resolutions on the matter.\r\nThe progress achieved in 2015 and 2016 showed \r\nthat Cuba and the United States can coexist in a \r\ncordial manner with respect for their differences. In \r\nconclusion, Angola encourages the United States and \r\nCuba to continue to work to build a relationship based \r\non dialogue, cooperation and mutual respect for the \r\nbenefit of both countries and their peoples.\r\nMr. Phansourivong (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): I would like to express our deepest \r\ncondolences to the United States, Argentina and Belgium \r\nfor the loss of human life in the wake of the terrorist act \r\nthat occurred yesterday in lower Manhattan, New York \r\nCity. We condemn that heinous attack.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic aligns itself \r\nwith the statements delivered by the representatives \r\nof the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Ecuador and \r\nSingapore on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, and the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations, respectively (see A/72/PV.38).\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic voted \r\nin favour of resolution 72/4 in order to reaffirm our \r\nposition that the imposition of the unilateral embargo on \r\nCuba, with its extraterritorial implications, has not only \r\nhindered the socioeconomic development of that nation, \r\nbut has also contradicted the principles and purposes \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and international \r\nlaw, as well as the sovereign equality of States and the \r\nfreedom of international trade and navigation.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic welcomes \r\nthe progress achieved over the past few years on the \r\nre-establishment of diplomatic relations between the \r\nRepublic of Cuba and the United States, including the \r\nreopening of the embassies in the respective capitals \r\nof both countries. However, it is regrettable to see that \r\nthe progress made through years of effort has now been \r\ncompromised. Nevertheless, we hope that the embargo \r\non Cuba will be lifted, as we firmly believe that the \r\nlifting of the embargo will not only be beneficial to \r\nboth countries, but will also benefit the region and the \r\nworld at large.\r\nMr. Castro Cordoba (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We join others in condemning the cowardly \r\nterrorist attack that took place here in New York City on \r\n31 October and express our solidarity with the United \r\nStates, Argentina and Belgium for the irreparable loss \r\nof human life.\r\nMy country associates itself with the interventions \r\nmade on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and of the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(see A/72/PV.38). In addition, in our national capacity, \r\nwe wish to reiterate the reasons why we voted in favour \r\nof resolution 72/4. We also welcome Foreign Minister \r\nRodríguez Parrilla.\r\nCosta Rica wishes to highlight once again the \r\nhistoric and significant progress that has taken place \r\nsince 2014 through the process of the improvement and \r\nre-establishment of bilateral ties between the United \r\nStates and Cuba. In that spirit, my country encourages \r\nA/72/PV.39 01/11/2017\r\n6/12 17-35997\r\nthe parties to maintain the agreements reached, to \r\nencourage further bilateral dialogue between the \r\ntwo parties and to replace the blockade, which has \r\nbeen in place for more than 55 years, with a fraternal \r\nmeeting of the peoples in all areas of economic, social, \r\ntechnological and political cooperation.\r\nIn strict respect for international law and the \r\nprinciples on which the Charter of the United Nations \r\nis based and consistent with its foreign policy, Costa \r\nRica reiterates its rejection of the unilateral and \r\nextraterritorial measures that a State may apply against \r\nanother by imposing its own laws and regulations \r\non third countries. Over the past few years, Costa \r\nRica and Cuba have continued to strengthen their \r\ndiplomatic relations in the fields of politics, economics \r\nand cooperation. Through the visit of the delegation \r\nof Costa Rica to Cuba in 2015, bilateral trade and \r\ncooperation in areas such as higher education, technical \r\ncooperation and scientific exchange, sports and health \r\nhave been promoted.\r\nIn the same vein, in March, a memorandum of \r\nunderstanding on science, technology and innovation \r\nwas signed between Costa Rica and Cuba in order to \r\npromote and facilitate a cooperative relationship in \r\nsuch matters. That memorandum is an example of the \r\nconstant dialogue between the two countries to work \r\ntogether to coordinate development in order to support \r\nand complement the programmes for strengthening \r\nhuman talent, with agreement on priority areas so as to \r\nbe able to align efforts and achieve common objectives.\r\nWe live in an interconnected world in which \r\nsolidarity and respect must be the basis of our \r\nexchanges. We cannot face the problems of the present \r\nby constantly reusing the tools of the past, especially \r\nif they have not been effective. The Organization, \r\nthrough the General Assembly, has manifested, clearly \r\nand forcefully, its disapproval of the blockade. It is time \r\nto definitively end it and build bridges between nations \r\nand peoples.\r\nI would like to conclude with the words spoken \r\nby the President of the Republic, Mr. Luis Guillermo \r\nSolís Rivera, in his statement during the recent \r\ngeneral debate:\r\n“In that regard, considering that unilateral \r\neconomic sanctions are not efficient ways to punish \r\nGovernments but can seriously harm the rights of \r\npeoples to well-being and development, I once again \r\nwould like to express the opposition of my country \r\nto the embargo that the United States has imposed \r\nagainst Cuba for 55 years, with high human, \r\neconomic and social costs for its population” \r\n(A/72/PV.5, p. 24).\r\nCosta Rica hopes that the blockade will soon \r\nbe lifted.\r\nMr. Rahmanto (Indonesia): I would like to express \r\nour sympathy and condolences to the people and the \r\nGovernment of the United States, as well to the peoples \r\nand the Governments of Argentina and Belgium, in the \r\nwake of the horrendous attack in New York City on \r\n31 October. We condemn all acts of terrorism.\r\nIndonesia aligns itself with the statements delivered \r\nearlier on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the \r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Organization \r\nof Islamic Cooperation and the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (see A/72/PV.38).\r\nIndonesia would also like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report (A/72/94) on \r\ntoday’s agenda item.\r\nAfter more than five decades, we are still witnessing \r\nthe detrimental impacts of the long-standing embargo on \r\nthe lives of the Cuban people. As a consequence of the \r\nembargo, the Cuban people have been left behind. Cuba \r\nhas been unable to realize its full potential and improve \r\nits economic, trade and financial relations with the rest \r\nof the world. It has been unable to exercise its full rights \r\nto reach for broader economic opportunities or build \r\nhigh-quality public health care and education. In that \r\nrespect, there has been virtually unanimous support \r\non the part of Member States to end the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba.\r\nThe policy of the United States in 2015 and 2016 \r\nwas encouraging and generated hope that the peoples \r\nof Cuba and the United States could live together in \r\nan amicable environment, respecting their differences \r\nwhile being able to cooperate for the benefit of the two \r\ncountries and peoples. It is therefore disheartening to \r\nwitness new measures being put in place that are aimed \r\nat further tightening the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba.\r\nToday, Indonesia joined the majority of Member \r\nStates in voting in favour of resolution 72/4. Indonesia \r\nreaffirms its fundamental belief that the continued \r\nimposition of an economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba contradicts the main principles \r\nof international law, including the Charter of the United \r\n01/11/2017 A/72/PV.39\r\n17-35997 7/12\r\nNations, the norms and principles governing peaceful \r\nrelations among States, the principles of the sovereign \r\nequality of States and of non-intervention in States’ \r\ndomestic affairs, and international humanitarian law. \r\nIndonesia would like to emphasize that the application \r\nof the embargo defies the spirit of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, which urges States to \r\nrefrain from promulgating and applying any unilateral \r\neconomic, financial or trade measures that are not in \r\naccordance with international law and the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and that impede the full achievement \r\nof economic and social development.\r\nTo conclude, Indonesia would like to reiterate our \r\nsupport for the rights of the Cuban people to enjoy full \r\nfreedom in their economic and social development. \r\nTowards that goal, we call for dialogue and cooperation \r\nas essential elements required for lifting the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nMr. Gertze (Namibia): The Namibian delegation \r\njoins others in extending our heartfelt condolences to \r\nthe victims, families and friends of those who perished \r\nin yesterday’s attack here in New York. We condemn \r\nthat terrorist attack in the strongest terms. \r\nNamibia also wishes to extend a warm welcome to \r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, for being here with us today.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representative of Venezuela, on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement; the representative of \r\nGabon, on behalf of the Group of African States; and \r\nthe representative of Ecuador, on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China (see A/72/PV.38).\r\nNamibia wants to put on record its appreciation \r\nfor the Secretary-General’s report (A/72/94) on the \r\nimplementation of resolution 71/5.\r\nIn this house of the people, the people have spoken \r\nwith a loud voice. Today’s vote condemning this long-\r\nstanding injustice reconfirms the strong resolve of the \r\nmajority of Member States not to be silenced. We stand \r\nresolute in our solidarity with the Cuban people and in \r\nour firm belief in and support for multilateralism. If \r\nwhat we, the people of the world, want most is peace \r\nand security and the well-being of the citizens of world \r\nthrough the pursuit of our development agenda, then \r\nsurely a policy of exclusion, a policy of economic \r\nand commercial embargo against a people who stand \r\nhead and shoulders above many of us with respect to \r\nshowing genuine support through self less cooperation \r\nin the fields of health and development, f lies in the face \r\nof the principles and values for which we all stand. It \r\nundermines our collective efforts to make the world a \r\nbetter place. \r\nFor 55 years, Cuba and the Cuban people have \r\nbeen victim of this unfair and unnecessary action. \r\nThe economic, commercial and financial blockade is \r\ncontrary to international law and the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. It violates the rights of the Cuban \r\npeople to health and food, and their rights to education, \r\nsports and culture and to development. It also severely \r\nimpacts the Cuban economy. It affects both foreign \r\ntrade and investments, as well as the finances of the \r\ncountry. In the past year, as in previous years, the \r\nincome denied to the people and the Government of \r\nCuba derived from the export of goods and services \r\nremained the most impacted by the embargo.\r\nAs Hurricane Irma tore through the Caribbean \r\nin early September, Cuba faced its first category-5 \r\nhurricane since 1937. Many homes were destroyed, \r\nthe electrical grid was severely damaged, and the \r\nagricultural sector was heavily impacted. Water \r\nservices were also damaged. The economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade against Cuba will severely \r\nimpact the recovery of the island in the aftermath of \r\nsuch a massive natural disaster. Surely, the natural \r\nhumanitarian reaction should be to lift the embargo in \r\norder to allow the Cubans to rebuild their island.\r\nAt this time last year we marked a historic day with \r\nthe adoption of resolution 71/5, in which both the United \r\nStates and Israel abstained for the first time. Indeed, we \r\nwere all encouraged by such forward movement, as well \r\nas by the improved relations earlier in 2016. Former \r\nPresident Obama recognized that the blockade was a \r\nfailed and obsolete policy that should be terminated, \r\nand prior to his departure, he urged the United States \r\nCongress to end it.\r\nWe were disheartened by the announcement on \r\n17 June of the new policy of the new Government of \r\nthe United States towards Cuba with the signing of \r\nthe directive entitled, “National Security Presidential \r\nMemorandum on Strengthening the Policy of the United \r\nStates towards Cuba”. That directive puts forward \r\nnew measures to tighten the blockade against Cuba. \r\nIt reverses the positive steps taken by the previous \r\nAdministration and marks a setback in the bilateral \r\nrelations between the two nations. We express our \r\nA/72/PV.39 01/11/2017\r\n8/12 17-35997\r\ndisappointment at those new tightened measures taken \r\nby the Government of the United States. We urge the \r\nUnited States to reconsider those new measures.\r\nWe remain hopeful that the economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade imposed by the United States \r\nagainst Cuba will be fully lifted, that relations will \r\nimprove and that the two countries will restore full \r\neconomic activities to their mutual benefit. Namibia \r\nwishes to put on record once again its full support for \r\nresolution 72/4.\r\nMs. Khyne (Myanmar): I would like to express \r\nour profound condolences to the families of the victims \r\nof yesterday’s terrorist attack in lower Manhattan and \r\nour solidarity with the United States, Argentina and \r\nBelgium. We condemn all acts of terrorism.\r\nI am taking the f loor to explain my delegation’s \r\nposition on resolution 72/4, which was just adopted by \r\na large majority of Member States.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of Ecuador, on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China; Singapore, on behalf \r\nof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; and \r\nVenezuela, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\n(see A/72/PV.38).\r\nIt has been more than five decades since the \r\nsanctions against Cuba were imposed and more than \r\ntwo decades since this item was put on the agenda of \r\nthe United Nations. The General Assembly has adopted \r\nresolutions on this agenda item with an overwhelming \r\nmajority of votes in favour annually. Yet, the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba has \r\nnot been lifted.\r\nMyanmar has joined the majority of Member States \r\nevery year to vote in favour of the resolution in order \r\nto demonstrate once again our firm rejection of the \r\nunilateral coercive measure before us today, namely, the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States against Cuba, which has hindered \r\nefforts by the Cuban people to eradicate poverty, \r\npromote their economic and social development, and \r\nachieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. The Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) clearly outline the overall need to work towards \r\nleaving no one behind.\r\nAs a country that has experienced similar unilateral \r\nsanctions in the past, Myanmar fully understands that \r\nthe imposition of sanctions on developing countries can \r\ncause great economic hardships, especially to the poor \r\nand vulnerable populations in those countries. Myanmar \r\nbelieves in the purposes and principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, as well as in the norms \r\nof international law and good-neighbourliness. Nations \r\nshould be guided by the principles enshrined in those \r\nguidelines, which stress the need  to coexist, respect \r\ndifferences, promote prosperity and ensure safety.\r\nMyanmar, together with the international \r\ncommunity, has consistently demonstrated that the \r\nembargo, as a unilateral measure, is inconsistent \r\nwith international law, transgresses fundamental \r\nhumanitarian principles and contravenes the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nMoreover, it is not in line with the letter and spirit of \r\nthe SDGs.\r\nMyanmar is of the view that an immediate end to \r\nthe economic embargo against Cuba is necessary and \r\nthat such an end will serve to promote the economic \r\nand social development of the people of Cuba. In \r\nthat regard, we urge that the embargo and coercive \r\nmeasures be replaced by dialogue and cooperation. \r\nFor those reasons, as in previous years, Myanmar has \r\nonce again voted in favour of the resolution on this \r\ntopic, in the hope that it will lead to the betterment of \r\nthe relationship between Cuba and the United States, \r\nas well as the prosperity of the entire international \r\ncommunity.\r\nMs. Fedorovich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nAllow me to express our deepest condolences to the \r\nUnited States in connection with the terrorist act \r\nthat occurred yesterday, as well as to Argentina and \r\nBelgium, which also lost citizens in that attack.\r\nBelarus voted in favour of resolution 72/4, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba” (see A/72/PV.38). Belarus has \r\nconsistently been against the use of unilateral sanctions \r\nin foreign policy, and we believe that it is unacceptable \r\nto use measures of economic coercion that contravene \r\nthe principles of international law. We consider such \r\neconomic sanctions to be a method of political pressure \r\nagainst sovereign States.\r\nIn that connection, we stress that the positive steps \r\nundertaken in 2015 and 2016 by the United States and \r\nCuba as part of the process of normalizing bilateral \r\nrelations contributed to the easing of the unilateral \r\ncoercive pressure on Cuba. That process gave the \r\n01/11/2017 A/72/PV.39\r\n17-35997 9/12\r\ninternational community hope that the long-standing \r\neconomic embargo against the island of freedom would \r\nend. We saw a clear example of how resolving the \r\nsituation in a civilized way, based on mutual respect \r\nand cooperation and on an equal footing, is not only \r\npossible but can be done very quickly.\r\nThat clearly demonstrates that the principle of the \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes is the correct and only \r\nway forward. We hope that that constructive process \r\nwill continue in spite of the maintenance, and even \r\nthe recent strengthening, of the restrictive measures \r\nagainst Cuba, including plans to introduce additional \r\nsanctions to the existing trade embargo. That situation \r\nnot only has a negative impact on the development of \r\nthe Cuban economy and the citizens of Cuba but also \r\naffects inhabitants of the United States.\r\nBelarus remains committed to the need to resolve \r\ndisputes between nations through realistic dialogue, as \r\nopposed to a policy of economic and political pressure \r\nof sanctions. We have stated repeatedly that attempts by \r\nsome States to change the domestic political system of \r\nothers through the use of military, political, economic \r\nor other means of pressure are unacceptable. Belarus \r\ncalls for the full, comprehensive and irreversible end \r\nto the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba by the United States.\r\nMr. Miangar (Chad) (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof Chad, I would like to join all other delegations in \r\nexpressing my condolences to the families of the victims \r\nand to the American people following the terrorist act \r\ncommitted yesterday in New York City. Chad forcefully \r\ncondemns that cowardly and ignoble act, and we \r\nexpress our solidarity to the American Government, as \r\nwell as our sympathy to the Governments of Argentina \r\nand Belgium, which also lost nationals in that attack.\r\nChad aligns itself with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Ecuador, Gabon and Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nrespectively, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the \r\nGroup of African States and the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation (see A/72/PV.38). Nevertheless, I wish to \r\nmake the following statement in my national capacity.\r\nChad welcomes the vote in favour of the resolution \r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States \r\nof America against Cuba” (resolution 72/4). Chad, \r\nwishing, on the one hand, to safeguard respect for the \r\nprinciple of sovereignty and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of States and, on the other, to preserve \r\ncooperative relations between States, was among the \r\nfirst countries to applaud the restoration of diplomatic \r\nrelations between the United States and Cuba.\r\nWith a view to encouraging the creation of \r\nfavourable conditions for the consolidation of the \r\nprogress made on the path towards the normalization \r\nof relations between the two States, Chad’s most senior \r\nofficials have advocated at every opportunity for the \r\ndefinitive lifting of the embargo imposed on Cuba. \r\nMost recently, during the general debate of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session, the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Chad, representing the President \r\nof the Republic, stated that:\r\n“Chad welcomed the resumption of diplomatic \r\nrelations between the United States and Cuba. \r\nThere is no longer any obstacle to the normalization \r\nof relations between the two countries. My \r\ncountry believes, therefore, that maintaining the \r\ndecades-long embargo against Cuba is unfair and \r\ncounterproductive.” (A/72/PV.21, p. 18).\r\nIt is in that spirit that Chad voted in favour of today’s \r\nresolution. The overwhelming majority vote in favour \r\nof the resolution reinforces the position of my country, \r\nand that position, along with that of all Member States, \r\nseeks to extricate Cuba and its people from the current \r\nsituation, which has undermined its economic efforts \r\nfor decades.\r\nChad believes that the definitive lifting of the \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba would enable Cuba to \r\nmake a greater contribution to the implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals and the development \r\nof international trade and solidarity among States. The \r\npresence of Cuban doctors in Chad and other countries \r\nto ease the suffering of our peoples is concrete proof \r\nof the important role that that friendly country plays in \r\ninternational solidarity.\r\nChad therefore reiterates its appeal to the \r\nGovernment of the United States of America to follow \r\nthe will of the international community as expressed by \r\nMember States.\r\nMs. Williams (Saint Kitts and Nevis): Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis would like to express condolences to the \r\nUnited States, Argentina and Belgium in the light of the \r\ntragedy yesterday, and we condemn all acts of terrorism.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis adds its voice in support of \r\nagenda item 42, “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nA/72/PV.39 01/11/2017\r\n10/12 17-35997\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”, and wishes \r\nto give its reasons for voting in favour of resolution \r\n72/4, adopted today by the majority of the membership \r\nof the United Nations (see A/72/PV.38). This is an \r\nextremely important debate that speaks to the very \r\ncore of international law, the principles of sovereignty \r\nand non-intervention, and the strengthened role of the \r\nUnited Nations in international affairs.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has very good relations \r\nwith the United States of America. It remains one of \r\nour closest and strongest partners, and we respect the \r\nrole that the United States has played in international \r\nrelations and in the establishment and promotion of the \r\nOrganization. It is a global leader, and we acknowledge \r\nand remain grateful for its role in international affairs.\r\nNevertheless, my delegation associates itself with \r\nthe statements made by the representatives of Venezuela, \r\nEcuador and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on \r\nbehalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, and the Caribbean Community, \r\nrespectively (see A/72/PV.38). Saint Kitts and Nevis, \r\nin its contribution to the Secretary-General’s report \r\non this topic (A/72/94), advises that we do not support \r\nor implement any laws that affect the free f low of \r\ninternational trade. We also advise that we do not apply \r\nlaws with extraterritorial effect, which impinge on the \r\nsovereignty of other States and the legitimate interests \r\nof entities or persons under their jurisdiction.\r\nThat is a principled position that extends to all \r\nStates Members of the Organization. Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis is therefore concerned that the embargo imposed \r\non Cuba still persists. Cuba is a close ally of Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis and has aided in the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of our country, especially in the areas of \r\nagriculture, education and health. Cuba could do even \r\nmore internationally if the embargo were removed.\r\nWe consider the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo to be a burden imposed on our brothers and \r\nsisters in Cuba. The negative impact on the economy of \r\nthat small island developing State is quite profound and \r\nunfair to the people of Cuba. No country should be left \r\nbehind, especially at this critical time in history as we \r\nall strive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nby 2030. This is a time for international cooperation \r\nand the pooling of resources to assist one another as we \r\nface up to that great challenge.\r\nThat is why Saint Kitts and Nevis once again calls \r\non the United States of America to remove the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. The fact that the majority of Member \r\nStates have traditionally voted in favour of the annual \r\ndraft resolution on the topic signifies the overriding \r\nsentiment that the embargo is wrong on all levels. \r\nIn that connection, we implore all Member States to \r\nrespect the sanctity of the General Assembly and the \r\ndecisions it takes. Failure to do that undermines the \r\nfunctioning of the United Nations system.\r\nIt is my delegation’s hope that the two countries, \r\nCuba and the United States, will be able to improve their \r\nrelationship and embark upon a process of partnership \r\nand cooperation. We can learn a lot from one another, \r\nbut the embargo remains an impediment to that process. \r\nThat is why Saint Kitts and Nevis supported today’s \r\nresolution 72/4. We reiterate our call on both countries \r\nto find common ground, so that the entire international \r\ncommunity can move on from this impasse.\r\nMr. Vieira (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): Brazil aligns \r\nitself with the statements made by the representative of \r\nEcuador on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and \r\nby the representative of El Salvador on behalf of the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(see A/72/PV.38). We would like to make the following \r\ncomments in our national capacity.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I also warmly welcome \r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, to this important debate.\r\nFor decades, Brazil has advocated for the \r\nnormalization of diplomatic relations between the \r\nUnited States of America and Cuba. In that context, \r\nthe Brazilian Government was delighted to follow the \r\nprocess of dialogue and the restoration of diplomatic \r\nrelations between the two countries carried out in 2015 \r\nand 2016. We regret, therefore, the recent measures \r\nannounced by the current Administration of the United \r\nStates that seek to reinforce the economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade against Cuba, including its \r\nextraterritorial dimensions.\r\nFrom Brazil’s point of view, the blockade represents \r\nan anachronistic policy that has negative effects not \r\nonly for Cuba, but for our entire region. In addition \r\nto being a f lagrant violation of the principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law, the \r\nblockade continues to negatively affect the welfare of \r\nthe Cuban people, especially the most vulnerable.\r\nThe lifting of the embargo against Cuba is a \r\nuniversal cause and has the unwavering support of the \r\n01/11/2017 A/72/PV.39\r\n17-35997 11/12\r\ninternational community, as made explicit by the voting \r\nresults on the resolutions on this topic in previous \r\nsessions of the General Assembly — particularly last \r\nyear, when there were no votes against. The result of \r\nthe voting this morning reiterates the solidarity of \r\nthe international community with the people and the \r\nGovernment of Cuba.\r\nMy delegation hopes that dialogue and cooperation \r\nbetween the two countries will resume soon, with \r\nthe aim of overcoming the setbacks to the process of \r\nnormalizing bilateral relations and thereby leading to \r\nthe end of the blockade.\r\nMs. Carrión (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): First \r\nof all, we would like to join other delegations in \r\ncondemning the terrorist attack that took place in this \r\ncity yesterday, as well as to express our condolences \r\nto the victims from the United States, Argentina \r\nand Belgium.\r\nWe wish to welcome the presence of the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Cuba, Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla. We also express our gratitude for the report \r\non today’s agenda item presented by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/72/94).\r\nUruguay aligns itself with the statements made \r\nby the representative of El Salvador on behalf of the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nand by the representative of Ecuador on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China (see A/72/PV.38).\r\nAs in previous years, Uruguay voted in favour \r\nof resolution 72/4, which once again this year \r\nwas submitted by the delegation of Cuba on the \r\nunderstanding that the blockade against that country \r\ncontravenes the rules of international law and is \r\ncontrary to the purposes and principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, particularly with regard to the \r\nprinciples of non-intervention, the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes and the legal equality of States.\r\nAs a matter of principle, Uruguay rejects and does \r\nnot recognize in its national legislation any other State’s \r\nextraterritorial application of domestic laws, as well \r\nas any direct or indirect mechanism that constitutes \r\nunilateral actions by a State with the objective of \r\nsanctioning the sovereign decisions of another State, \r\nwhether it be political, economic, commercial, social, \r\ncultural or anything else in nature. In that regard, \r\nwe condemn the application of unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures by the United States against Cuba.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, our country considers that \r\nthe sanctions imposed and the extraterritorial laws \r\nadopted against Cuba represent not only a violation of \r\ninternational law, but also have serious consequences \r\nfor the economic development of that brotherly \r\nCaribbean country and constitute a way of depriving \r\nthe Cuban people of their right to development, as well \r\nas unquantifiable, non-material damage to the dignity \r\nand sovereignty of the Cuban people.\r\nBy voting in favour of today’s resolution, Uruguay \r\nreiterates its commitment to multilateralism as a \r\nlegitimate and effective instrument for resolving \r\ndisputes between States and for promoting international \r\ncooperation, human rights, security and understanding \r\namong peoples.\r\nMs. Yánez Loza (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nFirst of all, allow me to join others in condemning \r\nyesterday’s terrorist act and to offer my condolences, \r\non behalf of the people and the Government of Ecuador, \r\nto the Governments of the United States, Belgium and \r\nArgentina, all of which suffered losses in the attack.\r\nSpeaking in its national capacity, and without \r\nprejudice to our role as Chair of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, my delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries and the Community of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States (see A/72/PV.38).\r\nMy delegation now wishes to comment on agenda \r\nitem 42, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”.\r\nAs in previous years, we voted in favour of \r\nresolution 72/4. In accordance with the purposes, \r\nprinciples and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nin particular the principles of the sovereign equality \r\nof States and non-intervention and non-interference \r\nin States’ internal affairs, which are also set out in \r\nour Constitution, Ecuador has consistently spoken in \r\nsupport of Cuba and for the lifting of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade that was imposed \r\n55 years ago by the United States.\r\nIn thanking the Secretary-General for his report on \r\nthe topic (A/72/94), we feel it necessary to emphasize \r\nthat that document also shows the extent of the effects \r\nof the blockade and includes the almost universal \r\ncall on the part of the members of the international \r\ncommunity for those unilateral measures to cease. \r\nA/72/PV.39 01/11/2017\r\n12/12 17-35997\r\nWe therefore regret that the blockade continues to be \r\nfully implemented and continues to tighten, regressing \r\nsharply from the policies adopted in 2015 and 2016 by \r\nthe previous Administration of the United States.\r\nWe are concerned about the prolonged negative \r\neffects of the blockade, given its impact on the economy \r\nand development of Cuba and the obstacles it poses \r\nto the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, to which we are all committed and for \r\nwhich we are all responsible. In that regard, we also \r\nrecall the policy of solidarity and cooperation that Cuba \r\nhas maintained for decades, particularly in matters of \r\nhealth emergencies. Once again, Ecuador calls for the \r\nimmediate cessation of the unilateral measures imposed \r\nby the United States, as we are convinced that their \r\nelimination will benefit not only Cuba but the entire \r\ninternational community.\r\nMr. Ntonga (Zimbabwe): The delegation of \r\nZimbabwe conveys sincere and heartfelt condolences to \r\nthe United States, Argentina and Belgium on the loss of \r\nlives as a result of the horrific attack yesterday in New \r\nYork City. Our thoughts and prayers go to the bereaved \r\nfamilies in this time of loss, pain and sorrow.\r\nWe associate ourselves with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representative of Ecuador on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China, by the representative \r\nof the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on behalf of \r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and by the \r\nrepresentative of Gabon on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States, respectively (see A/72/PV.38).\r\nTogether with 190 other countries, Zimbabwe voted \r\nin favour of resolution 72/4, because we firmly believe \r\nthat the embargo against Cuba constitutes a violation \r\nof the principles of international law and the purposes \r\nand principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. The embargo also constitutes a violation of \r\nhuman rights, as it hurts the average Cuban person. It \r\nalso infringes upon the rights of other countries to trade \r\nfreely with Cuba.\r\nDespite the embargo, Cuba has continued to play \r\nconstructive roles in international affairs. There are \r\nmany examples of Cuba’s international statesmanship \r\nand good global citizenship. Africa can attest to the \r\nintervention by Cuba when the Ebola crisis broke out in \r\nWest Africa in 2015 and the World Health Organization \r\nissued a global appeal for medical staff to help fight the \r\ncrisis. Despite its own severe economic challenges as a \r\nresult of the trade embargo, Cuba was among the first \r\ncountries to respond, as it sent legions of doctors to the \r\nregion to deal with the crisis.\r\nWe commend the people of Cuba for their resilience \r\ndespite facing years of an unwarranted embargo.\r\nThe international community has once again spoken \r\nin favour of dialogue and cooperation. We hope that \r\nthat humble and constructive message has been heard.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in explanation of vote after \r\nthe voting.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 42?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.10 p.m.\r\n"
