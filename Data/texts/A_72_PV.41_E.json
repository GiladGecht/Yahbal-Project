"United Nations A/72/PV.41\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n41st plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 7 November 2017, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 122\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand other matters related to the Security Council\r\nThe President: I thank all present for being \r\nhere today to discuss the important issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform. I would like to express my gratitude \r\nto Ambassador Imnadze of Georgia and Ambassador \r\nNusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates for agreeing \r\nto serve as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process. They have both taken on an \r\nimportant responsibility, and I am confident that \r\nthey will receive members’ support in both words \r\nand actions. I would also like to sincerely thank the \r\nformer co-Chairs, Ambassador Jinga of Romania and \r\nAmbassador Khiari of Tunisia, for their diligent and \r\nvaluable work. I would like to make three points in \r\norder to frame our discussion today.\r\nFirst, the reform of the Security Council will not \r\njust affect the work that takes place a few doors down \r\nfrom us in the Council Chamber. Rather, it will impact \r\nthe future of the entire United Nations system. We are \r\nhearing more and more calls for the United Nations to \r\nchange and evolve at a faster pace. Those calls have come \r\nfrom across the world, not just from States Members \r\nof the United Nations. In fact, in September, high-level \r\nrepresentatives of Member States stood at this rostrum \r\nand stressed the need for the United Nations to adapt to \r\na changing world, and many of them even made direct \r\ncalls for Security Council reform.\r\nWe must remember that the Security Council is the \r\norgan charged with maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. Its decisions can mean the difference between \r\nlife or death. That is why the Security Council often \r\nmakes international headlines and why its work is seen \r\nas one of the major indicators of the United Nations role \r\nin the world. Moreover, that is why we must answer \r\nthose calls for change, in particular in relation to the \r\nSecurity Council. If we do not, the continued relevance \r\nand, frankly, the very survival of the United Nations \r\nare at stake.\r\nSecondly, in answering those calls, we do not need \r\nto look further than this Hall. All of us sitting here today \r\nhold the keys to change. The Council was designed in \r\n1945, when the world looked very different from how it \r\nlooks today. However, there has been only one change \r\nin the Council’s membership since then, and that came \r\nthrough the expansion in the number of non-permanent \r\nmembers in 1965, more than half a century ago. But \r\nthe failure to change is not for lack of trying. Next \r\nyear, the Open-ended Working Group will mark the \r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of its establishment. We are \r\nalso approaching our tenth year of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. However, \r\nthe time for merely trying is up. Now is the time for \r\naction. For our purposes, action means dialogue — real \r\ndialogue, real listening, real interaction. Without those \r\nelements, the reform process will become nothing \r\nbut an exercise in reading out statements. It will \r\nfeature nothing but the repetition of well-known, \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org).

In that case, what is the incentive for \r\ncompromise? Where can convergences emerge from? \r\nHow can we ever move forward?\r\nThat brings me to my third point, namely, that we \r\nmust look to the process ahead. It must be credible. \r\nMember States must believe and trust in it. That is why \r\nI am committed to transparency and inclusivity. After \r\nconsultations with the co-Chairs and Member States, \r\nwe shall start that process as early as possible, and a full \r\ncalendar will be circulated in advance to Member States \r\nto allow for forward planning. I hope that that approach \r\nwill both enhance the quality of our discussions and \r\nfacilitate engagement by all delegations. During this \r\nsession of the General Assembly, the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation process must lead to meaningful progress. \r\nThat is our collective duty. However, how that happens \r\nand the pace at which it happens is up to the Assembly. \r\nMy team and I are here to support the process in any \r\nway we can.\r\nI cannot skirt around the issue today; I am \r\ncompelled to address it head-on. And, in doing so, I \r\nneed to admit that not all of us see eye to eye on the \r\nissue of Security Council reform. In fact, some of us are \r\nat opposite ends of the spectrum. However, some of the \r\nmost difficult negotiations throughout history started \r\nout in just that way. In many cases, parties could not \r\neven meet in the same room. That means that we are \r\nalready a step ahead, and we too can come closer to the \r\nmiddle. We too can, day by day, make what may seem \r\nlike an impossible agreement become possible. We too \r\ncan make history. We can start through dialogue, and \r\nwe can start today.\r\nMr. Sumah (Sierra Leone): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the States members \r\nof the African Union.\r\nI thank you, Mr. President, for convening this \r\ndebate on agenda item 122, entitled “Question of \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and other matters \r\nrelated to the Security Council”. We acknowledge and \r\nstrongly appreciate your opening remarks, and we wish \r\nto reiterate the commitment of the States members of \r\nthe African Union to this very important issue, in spite \r\nof the tremendous difficulties that exist, as you seek to \r\nguide and move the process forward. Let me also use \r\nthis occasion to congratulate you once again, on behalf \r\nof the African States, on your election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session.\r\nLet me also congratulate Mr. Kaha Imnadze, \r\nPermanent Representative of Georgia, and Mrs. Lana \r\nZaki Nusseibeh, Permanent Representative of the United \r\nArab Emirates, on their appointment as co-Chairs of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. We also express \r\nour support and readiness to work with the co-Chairs \r\nin building on the gains made so far in the reform \r\nprocess. We also want to thank the previous co-Chairs, \r\nAmbassadors Mohamed Khiari and Ion Jinga, the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Tunisia and Romania, \r\nrespectively, for their stewardship of the process during \r\nthe seventy-first session.\r\nFollowing the 2005 World Summit and its \r\nOutcome, a number of Heads of State and Government, \r\nspeaking at the general debate of the Assembly this \r\nyear, continued to reaffirm the need to reform the \r\nSecurity Council in order to make it more broadly \r\nrepresentative, democratic, effective, transparent, \r\naccessible and legitimate. We must therefore seek to \r\nreach an agreement on a reform model that would take \r\ninto account the core values of the United Nations.\r\nAs a group, the African States remains convinced \r\nof the need for a comprehensive reform of the United \r\nNations system that upholds the principles, objectives \r\nand ideals of the Charter of the United Nations, so as \r\nto achieve a fairer world based on universalism, equity \r\nand regional balance. To that end, we remain true and \r\nfaithful to decision 62/557, on the topic before us today, \r\nand other relevant General Assembly decisions aimed \r\nat a comprehensive reform of the Security Council, \r\nwhile encompassing the five main clusters and taking \r\ninto account their interconnectedness, as agreed by \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nIt is clear that there is general agreement to \r\nreform the Security Council, despite the existence of \r\nsome disagreement on the exact method for achieving \r\nthe reform. What is notable, however, is the fact that \r\nthere has been convergence in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, including growing support for expansion \r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent categories \r\nof membership. In fact, that view is shared by a cross-\r\nsection of the membership of the Assembly, and it is in \r\nline with the political commitment made by our leaders \r\nin 2005.\r\nMoreover, there is considerable support for the \r\ninclusion of small and medium-sized States, and of \r\ncourse enhanced African representation, in an expanded \r\nSecurity Council. As a group, we note that the main \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 3/29\r\naim of the various groups and stakeholders’ positions is \r\nto ensure that the Council represents the present global \r\ngeopolitical realities. That, we believe, will help to \r\nensure the promotion and preservation of the principles \r\nof equity and democracy, as well as further enhance the \r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness of the United Nations and, \r\nin particular, of the Security Council.\r\nSince the adoption of decision 62/557, the reform \r\nprocess has, at best, forged ahead cautiously and at \r\na very slow pace. The positions and proposals of the \r\nvarious groups and Member States have been stated \r\nand restated during the many exchanges during the \r\nvarious intergovernmental negotiations. Convergences, \r\ndivergences and possible sticking areas are now very \r\nwell known. There is no doubt that past exchanges \r\nhave been interactive and productive. However, actual \r\nnegotiations have not yet begun. That, I believe, is \r\nan appropriate point to review, so as to achieve a \r\nmeaningful reform process. It is now time to move \r\nfrom rhetoric to action and produce the desired results \r\nindicated in the 2005 World Summit Outcome. We \r\ntherefore hope that the spirit of an effective interactive \r\napproach that focuses on a possible negotiating process \r\nin a not-too-distant future will dictate the pace of the \r\nreform process.\r\nAt this stage, a work plan, a timeline for negotiations \r\nand the modalities by which agreements could be \r\nreached on given issues are of great necessity. That \r\ncould help set the pace for moving the reform process \r\nin a more meaningful direction with a view to driving \r\nit towards real negotiations. It is therefore crucial for \r\nthe entire membership of the Assembly to agree first on \r\nthe principles and criteria of the negotiations vis-à-vis \r\nthe five negotiable clusters and their relationship. \r\nAccordingly, in seeking progress on the reform process, \r\nwe must at this stage endeavour to reach an agreement \r\non how to move forward and reconcile the outcomes \r\nset out in the various documents produced during \r\nthe sixty-ninth, seventieth and seventy-first sessions, \r\nwith a view to forming the basis for the work of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during this session. \r\nWhat is of critical significance in guiding the reform \r\nprocess is the acknowledgement of the interlinkages \r\namong the five negotiable clusters.\r\nWe cannot talk about the size of an enlarged \r\nSecurity Council without talking about the categories of \r\nmembership, since enlargement of the Council in both \r\nthe permanent and the non-permanent categories will \r\ndefinitely affect its size. Also, the size of an enlarged \r\nCouncil will affect the cluster on equitable regional \r\nrepresentation. In other words, in order to correct the \r\ncurrent imbalance in the Security Council, we must \r\nenlarge its size, which must also take into account the \r\nneed to redress the protracted historical injustice done \r\nto Africa in terms of representation in the Council. That \r\ntherefore explains the need for a comprehensive reform \r\nof the Security Council, as opposed to a piecemeal and/\r\nor intermediate procedural reform of the Council.\r\nConsidering the present international landscape, it \r\nis unacceptable that Africa is the only continent not to \r\nbe represented in the permanent category of Council \r\nmembership, while it is also underrepresented in the \r\nnon-permanent category. We will therefore continue to \r\ndemand the allocation of no less than two permanent seats \r\nto Africa, with all the prerogatives and privileges of the \r\npermanent members, and a total of five non-permanent \r\nseats. The selection of such representatives will be done \r\nby our regional organization, the African Union, which \r\nhas enviable credentials in selecting its candidates \r\nto serve in multilateral organizations, including the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThat demand, which is a continent-wide aspiration, \r\nis aimed at ensuring Africa’s right to fair and equitable \r\ngeographical representation on the Security Council. \r\nThe need to adhere to that demand and to address \r\nthe grossly unjust scenario is fundamental. A delay \r\nwould mean further perpetuating and compounding \r\nthe existing injustice and, concomitantly, denying the \r\nregion its rightful place in the major decision-making \r\norgan of the Organization. We are therefore pleased that \r\na considerable number of Member States support the \r\nenlargement of the Security Council to reflect equitable \r\nregional representation.\r\nOur continued participation in this debate is firmly \r\nrooted in our commitment to the Common African \r\nPosition, articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and \r\nthe Sirte Declaration. We remain firmly convinced \r\nthat the Common African Position continues to \r\nenjoy the broadest support of the majority of the \r\nmembership and that it remains a viable option in the \r\nreform process. Africa therefore continues to urge all \r\ninterest groups and stakeholders and the wider United \r\nNations membership to demonstrate their commitment \r\nto correcting the historical injustice by concretely \r\nsupporting the African position, which will clearly lead \r\nto reforming the Council so that it can become a more \r\ninclusive, democratic and effective organ.\r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n4/29 17-36269\r\nIn conclusion, we keenly look forward to the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the seventy-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly, We hope that \r\nthe session will build upon the progress made so far \r\nand will accelerate the pace in attaining concrete gains \r\ntowards fulfilling the forthright vision of our leaders at \r\nthe 2005 World Summit. Africa is very much committed \r\nto the important issue of reform. We therefore look \r\nforward to working with you, Mr. President, and the \r\ngeneral membership within the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations for a comprehensive reform, as stipulated \r\nunder Assembly decision 62/557. We will remain \r\nopen to working alongside and/or together with any \r\nother initiative that takes into account the level of \r\ncommitment and support that the Common African \r\nPosition has gained so far. We continue to call for \r\nmore frank debates, which will generate the necessary \r\npolitical will, leading to the much-needed reform \r\nof the Security Council in order to better reflect the \r\ngeopolitical realities of the twenty-first century.\r\nMr. Almunayekh (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the Group of \r\nArab States.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to highlight the support \r\nof the Arab Group for your efforts, Mr. President, at \r\nthe helm of the General Assembly during this session. \r\nIn that regard, our Group welcomes the appointment of \r\nAmbassador Kaha Imnadze, Permanent Representative \r\nof Georgia, and Ambassador Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, \r\nPermanent Representative of the United Arab Emirates, \r\nas co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiation \r\nprocess on the reform of the Security Council. I cannot \r\nfail to commend the efforts of the co-Chairs at the \r\nprevious session, namely, Ambassador Mohamed \r\nKhaled Khiari, Permanent Representative of Tunisia, \r\nand Ambassador Ion Jinga, Permanent Representative \r\nof Romania. I would like to thank them for having \r\nbrought the points of views of the groups and countries \r\ncloser together in the context of those negotiations.\r\nThe reform of, and equitable representation in, the \r\nSecurity Council are among the main principles of a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations, given \r\nthe major challenges that the international community \r\nfaces. Those challenges make us even more determined \r\nto step up efforts to strengthen the role of the Security \r\nCouncil so that it can better deal with the challenges \r\nit faces in a transparent and credible way. Four years \r\nafter the start of the negotiations to expand the \r\nnumber of Security Council members and to improve \r\nits working methods, during which several initiatives \r\nwere presented by countries and groups of countries, \r\nincluding the Arab Group, it has become important \r\nto move forward with Security Council reform and to \r\nseek to achieve consensus-based decisions based on \r\nagreement among countries on the principles of change \r\nand reform, in particular given the significant changes \r\nthat have taken place in the world since the United \r\nNations was established in 1945. However, we do not \r\nnecessarily need to set a timeline that would prevent the \r\nfinding of a comprehensive solution to reform.\r\nIn that regard, the Arab Group reiterates once \r\nagain that the intergovernmental negotiations within \r\nthe General Assembly represent the only way to find \r\na solution, in line with decision 62/557, in the five \r\ncategories of reform, namely, membership, the veto \r\npower, regional representation, the size of an enlarged \r\nSecurity Council and the working methods of the \r\nCouncil, and the relationship between the Council and \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThe Arab Group also underscores that all of those \r\nissues are closely linked. The various negotiations need \r\nto take into consideration all those issues in order to \r\nachieve comprehensive reform. The Arab Group also \r\nwishes to reiterate that restarting the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during the seventy-second session should \r\ninclude all positions and proposals put forward by \r\nMember States during the negotiations. There is no \r\ndoubt whatsoever that such a basis should guide the \r\ntwo co-Chairs as they seek to reopen the negotiations \r\naimed at achieving consensus among Member States \r\nand making progress in that regard. The Arab Group \r\nreaffirms its position to preserve the consistent \r\nposition of the Security Council and not to obstruct the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in any way by imposing \r\nmeasures that are not consensus-based.\r\nWe face numerous challenges, including the veto \r\npower. The arbitrary use of the veto by some Member \r\nStates has harmed the credibility of decision-making \r\nwithin the Security Council. That has sometimes led \r\nto the Security Council being unable to shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities. The Council has therefore been unable \r\nto take the necessary measures to maintain international \r\npeace and security. The use of the veto power by \r\npermanent members has shown that those countries \r\nprotect their national interests or the interests of their \r\nallies. It is true that, in recent years, the veto power has \r\nnot been used as often as in previous times. However, \r\nit has shown itself to be an effective way to prevent \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 5/29\r\nsome countries from shouldering their responsibilities. \r\nOver the past 20 years, the veto was used 27 times to \r\nprotect Israel from the consequences of its practices in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories.\r\nIt is crucial that we improve the Security Council’s \r\nworking methods so as to make it more effective \r\nand more transparent. At the same time, we need to \r\nreach agreement on standing rules of procedure, as \r\nthe ones we have now are provisional. Similarly, the \r\nnumber of plenary Security Council meetings needs \r\nto be increased, thereby strengthening the role of the \r\ncountries affected by the issues being discussed by \r\nthe Council. Such meetings would provide concrete \r\nopportunities for non-members of the Security Council \r\nto participate in its debates. Moreover, the number \r\nof closed meetings needs to be reduced and should \r\nbecome the exception rather than the rule. Decisions \r\nand statements available to the Council need be made \r\nreadily accessible. Consultations with countries \r\nconcerned by the issues being discussed by the Security \r\nCouncil need to be increased in accordance with Article \r\n31 of the Charter of the United Nations. The subsidiary \r\nbodies and committees of the Security Council need \r\nto make information concerning their work available. \r\nFurthermore, the Security Council needs to show \r\ngreater respect for its mandate.\r\nThe position of the Group of Arab States with \r\nregard to the reform of the Security Council is well-\r\nknown, namely, that its member States are asking for \r\npermanent Arab representation, as well as proportional \r\nrepresentation in the non-permanent member category. \r\nUltimately, the Arab Group is committed to participating \r\nconstructively in the next round of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations with a view to reaching consensus that \r\nwill allow us to comprehensively and effectively reform \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nMr. Bessho (Japan): I have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the Group of Four: Brazil, Germany, India and \r\nmy own country, Japan.\r\nI would like to express our sincere appreciation \r\nto you, Sir, for convening this important and timely \r\ndebate. I welcome your intention “to promote a credible \r\nprocess to address the reform of the Security Council”, \r\nas you mentioned in the general debate in September \r\n(A/72/PV.3, p.6), as well as this morning. You can \r\ncount on our full support in making this a credible \r\nprocess. I would also like to congratulate Ambassador \r\nKaha Imnadze of Georgia and Ambassador Lana \r\nZaki Nusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates on their \r\nappointment as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. The Group of Four stands ready to support \r\nthem in undertaking their important role.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is long overdue. \r\nIf we truly seek to preserve the credibility of the \r\nworking of the General Assembly, and indeed of the \r\nentire United Nations, there is no more time to lose. \r\nThat is the first message that I would like to convey \r\nto everyone today. To underline the urgency of making \r\nreal progress, let me just name a few milestones in the \r\nlong history of efforts to reform the Security Council.\r\nFirst, in 1979, a request was submitted for the \r\ninclusion of an item entitled “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council” on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly. Secondly, this year marks the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of resolution 47/62, in \r\nDecember 1992, which requested the Secretary-General \r\nto invite Member States to submit written comments on \r\nthat issue. Thirdly, the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\nclearly called on Heads of State and Government to \r\nsupport early reform of the Security Council. Lastly, \r\nat the end of the current session, it will have been 10 \r\nyears since the General Assembly adopted decision \r\n62/557 to initiate the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nSadly, despite all those efforts, we are still very far \r\nfrom where we should be.\r\nNonetheless, we were encouraged to hear you say, \r\nSir, upon your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly last spring that,\r\n“[t]here is a high degree of accord that the time \r\nis ripe to transform the Security Council into a \r\ntwenty-first century body” (A/71/PV.83, p.3).\r\nThe Group of Four fully agrees. The Group will \r\nspare no efforts to translate those words into action \r\nunder your able leadership, Sir, and in cooperation with \r\nother Member States.\r\nMy second message is the following: text-based \r\nnegotiations should be initiated immediately. That is \r\nprecisely the process that we use to translate words into \r\naction here in the United Nations. Out of 193 Member \r\nStates, an overwhelming majority of 164 support \r\nbeginning text-based negotiations. The Group of Four \r\nalready underlined that fact in a statement delivered on \r\nits behalf by the representative of Germany to the General \r\nAssembly last July (see A/71/PV.92). I also appreciate \r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n6/29 17-36269\r\nthe initiative that the Permanent Representative of \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines took on behalf of the \r\nL.69 group to submit a letter that clearly articulates that \r\nsame fact and sets the record straight with regard to the \r\noverwhelming view of the Assembly.\r\nThe time for simply repeating statements and \r\nemphasizing differences is over. With that in mind, I \r\nrespectfully ask the President of the General Assembly \r\nto grant the co-Chairs his full support for initiating text-\r\nbased negotiations without further delay. That is not \r\nmerely the request of a particular group of countries, \r\nbut a necessity in order to ensure the credibility of the \r\nprocess. After all, what other negotiations in the history \r\nof the United Nations have continued for decades without \r\na text? The positions and proposals of Member States \r\nare reflected in the framework document and its annex, \r\nwhich provide a basis for negotiations. Additionally, \r\nthe paper issued by the previous co-Chairs during the \r\nseventy-first session of the General Assembly, entitled \r\n“Elements of commonality and issues for further \r\nconsideration”, can also serve as a reference. The \r\nnecessary and logical next step is to prepare a concise \r\nand operational negotiation text — preferably in the \r\nform of a draft resolution. We need to launch text-based \r\nnegotiations now, indeed as early as possible during \r\nthe current session, so as to allow sufficient time for \r\nmeaningful progress to be made during the remainder \r\nof the session.\r\nLastly, I would like to emphasize that an early \r\nreform of the Council is needed in order to make it \r\nmore legitimate, effective and representative, thereby \r\nreflecting the realities of the twenty-first century. In \r\norder to achieve that goal, increasing representation in \r\nboth the permanent and the non-permanent categories \r\nis required. There is broad support from Member \r\nStates for that method of expanding Security Council \r\nmembership. Its enlargement should consider the \r\ncontribution of Member States to the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. It also needs \r\nto enhance regional representation in the Security \r\nCouncil by ensuring that the concerns and aspirations \r\nof unrepresented or underrepresented regions are \r\nadequately taken into account. In particular, the \r\nhistorical injustice that Africa has suffered should be \r\nredressed through representation in both the permanent \r\nand non-permanent categories.\r\nSecretary-General Guterres is taking bold and \r\nnecessary steps to reform the United Nations across its \r\nthree pillars, in order to render it fit for the twenty-\r\nfirst century. The Group of Four supports his efforts. \r\nAnother indispensable element of reforming and \r\nstrengthening the United Nations must be reform of \r\none of its principal organs, the Security Council. In the \r\nSecretary-General’s own words, reform of the United \r\nNations will not be complete without reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. Progress in Security Council reform \r\nis critical, and all the elements are present. If we can \r\nput them together, we can succeed. We must succeed. \r\nThe legitimacy, effectiveness and representativeness \r\nof the Security Council are at stake and, with them, \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nAs President Mandela said, it always seems impossible \r\nuntil it is done.\r\nMr. Lambertini (Italy): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Uniting for Consensus (UFC) group. I \r\nwould like to thank you, Mr. President, for convening \r\nthis annual debate on Security Council reform. We \r\ncommend your commitment to a reform process that is \r\ncredible, transparent and inclusive. Building on those \r\nsame principles, the Uniting for Consensus group looks \r\nforward to cooperating with the new co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform, Ambassadors Nusseibeh and Imnadze. We \r\nwarmly welcome them in their new capacity and wish \r\nto express our full support for them in the upcoming \r\nintergovernmental negotiations session.\r\nThe credibility of a membership-driven process \r\nsuch as the intergovernmental negotiations depends \r\non its transparency and inclusiveness. Only through a \r\ntransparent process that takes into account the voices of \r\nall Member States can we jointly define the consensual \r\npath that the Uniting for Consensus group believes is \r\nthe key to making concrete progress. All we have to do \r\nis avoid the obstacles that have so far prevented us from \r\nachieving our common goal and work in a true spirit of \r\nf lexibility and compromise.\r\nOver the years, the Uniting for Consensus group \r\nhas consistently pointed out that the main roadblock to \r\nreform is the demand for an increase in the number of \r\npermanent members on the Council. At the same time, \r\nwe have offered a compromise solution consisting of \r\nlonger-term non-permanent members with the possibility \r\nof an immediate re-election, coupled with a more \r\nequitable distribution of seats among regional groups. \r\nLonger-term seats would fulfil the legitimate desire of \r\nsome Member States to make a greater contribution \r\nto the work of the Council. That reform model would \r\nenhance regional representation as follows. Africa \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 7/29\r\nwould constitute the largest group on the reformed \r\nCouncil, while the Asia-Pacific region would have the \r\nhighest percentage increase and the representation of \r\nboth Latin America and Eastern Europe would double. \r\nOur proposed distribution would also enable cross-\r\nregional groupings such as the Group of Arab States \r\nto have greater, more stable representation. At the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations meeting on 8 May we \r\ndistributed a chart with a breakdown of our regional \r\nrepresentation proposal. A copy of it is available on \r\nPaperSmart, attached to my statement.\r\nOur initiative is the fruit of an inclusive vision that \r\nwe are firmly convinced would bring about a more \r\nrepresentative, democratic, accountable, transparent \r\nand effective Council. So we were taken aback by the \r\nopposition that some delegations expressed last year to \r\nthe principles of democracy and representation. On the \r\none hand, it revealed the true underlying reasons for \r\nthe current stalemate. On the other, it showed us how \r\nurgently we need a serious discussion of the principles \r\nunderpinning Security Council reform. Without clarity \r\non what we are aiming for, we will never reach our \r\ndestination. We expect Member States to finally be \r\ngiven the opportunity to engage in just such a discussion \r\nduring this session, paving the way for the next steps \r\nbefore us, including text-based negotiations.\r\nLast year the whole United Nations membership \r\nagreed that — and I quote the co-Chairs’ final document,\r\n“The intergovernmental negotiations process \r\nshould build on the work done in previous years, \r\nso that convergence will increase gradually \r\nwith a view to garnering the widest possible \r\npolitical acceptance.”\r\nThis document enables us to say unequivocally that \r\nall Member States agree with the idea of expanding \r\nthe number of non-permanent seats on the Council. \r\nAll Member States agree that such an increase should \r\nfavour countries belonging to the underrepresented \r\nregions of the world. To that, we should add that a \r\nsignificant and growing number of Member States are \r\nopposed to an expansion of the veto and indeed support \r\nlimitations on its use.\r\nIf we are to truly build on the work of previous \r\nyears, then the middle ground for a compromise \r\nsolution leading to Security Council reform can be \r\nmapped out only on the basis of these three broad \r\nareas of agreement. They are the pillars of our new \r\nCouncil, which we all want to reflect the reality of the \r\ncontemporary world. But the reality of the twenty-first \r\ncentury is constantly evolving, with new regional actors \r\nand new global challenges continuing to emerge in a \r\nchanging reality to which the Council must constantly \r\nadapt. There is no better guarantee of that adaptability \r\nthan regular elections, which would also make the \r\nSecurity Council more democratic, accountable and \r\ninclusive by offering all Member States, rather than a \r\nselect few, the opportunity to make a greater and more \r\nfrequent contribution to the Council’s work.\r\nAfter almost 25 years of focusing on demands \r\nfor new permanent seats, which would benefit only \r\na handful of Member States, it is high time to give a \r\nconcrete chance to all Member States and offer real \r\nprospects to the groups of States and regions of the \r\nworld that are underrepresented on the Council. We \r\nsee no possibility that adding new vetoes could make \r\na new Council more effective, more responsive to \r\ninternational crises or better able to cope with today’s \r\nglobal challenges.\r\nThe Uniting for Consensus group stands ready \r\nto cooperate with you, Mr. President, with the new \r\nintergovernmental negotiations co-Chairs and the whole \r\nmembership to advance this process, with the common \r\ngoal of increasing the Council’s legitimacy in the eyes \r\nof both the general membership and international \r\npublic opinion, thereby enhancing its authority and, \r\nultimately, its effectiveness. We are willing to redouble \r\nour efforts to achieve reform without delay, building on \r\nthe many existing convergences among Member States \r\nto arrive at a comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil that will garner the broadest possible consensus \r\nby enlarging the Council with new elected members \r\nand a more balanced and equitable representation of \r\nregional groups.\r\nMr. Ten-Pow (Guyana): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the 14 States \r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) as \r\nour contribution to today’s debate on the question of \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nCARICOM would like to thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor your decision to appoint Ambassadors Lana \r\nNusseibeh, Permanent Representative of the United \r\nArab Emirates, and Kaha Imnadze, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Georgia, as co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations for the current session. \r\nWe would also like to express our appreciation to \r\nthem for accepting the appointment. CARICOM looks \r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n8/29 17-36269\r\nforward to working with them and with Member States \r\nto advance the Assembly’s work under this agenda \r\nitem, and we reiterate our full support for the process. \r\nWe would also like to thank Ambassadors Ion Jinga \r\nof Romania and Mohamed Khaled Khiari of Tunisia \r\nfor their able stewardship of this process during the \r\nseventy-first session.\r\nIn your address to the First Committee on \r\n2 October (see A/C.1/72/PV.2), Mr. President, you \r\ncalled on Member States to summon the political will \r\nto do more in the context of our work on disarmament \r\nand international security. Today CARICOM extends \r\nthat call to Member States in the context of their work \r\non reform of the Security Council, as we believe that \r\npolitical will is crucial to achieving forward movement \r\non this long-standing issue. It is incumbent on all of us \r\nto demonstrate our commitment to the goal of reform, \r\nas it is the Member States themselves that must work to \r\nachieve it.\r\nIn 1993, when the General Assembly established \r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question \r\nof Equitable Representation on and Increase in the \r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters \r\nrelated to the Security Council to consider matters \r\nrelated to Security Council reform, that decision was \r\nbased on its recognition of the need to\r\n“review the membership of the Security Council \r\nand related matters in view of the substantial \r\nincrease in the membership of the United Nations, \r\nespecially of developing countries, as well as the \r\nchanges in international relations” (resolution \r\n48/26, third preambular paragraph).\r\nTwo and a half decades later, that need has not been \r\ncomprehensively addressed, although we have had \r\nlimitless opportunities to work to restructure the Council \r\nin order to bring it into line with current realities.\r\nCARICOM wants to see progress on the issue, and \r\nwe believe that it is possible, given the tremendous \r\nnumber of ideas that have been generated since the \r\nstart of our debates on the question of Security Council \r\nreform. We are conscious, however, that progress \r\nrequires putting those ideas to work, and many Member \r\nStates, including the members of CARICOM, have \r\nput forward proposals and articulated their positions \r\non how to achieve progress on the issue. Beyond \r\nthat, Member States have agreed on the forum within \r\nwhich that progress is to be pursued, namely, the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nWe have heard the arguments against having a \r\nnegotiating text. After two and a half decades of very \r\nlittle progress, CARICOM believes that our discussions \r\nmust zero in on those fundamental issues that divide us \r\non the basis of clearly laid-out positions and proposals. \r\nI will again allude to your 2 October address to the First \r\nCommittee, Mr. President, when you urged Member \r\nStates to be constructive and reach across the aisle. \r\nCARICOM is prepared to engage constructively, as we \r\nhave always done, and we are hopeful that this session’s \r\nintergovernmental negotiations will indeed build on \r\nwhat has been achieved so far.\r\nIn conclusion, CARICOM remains committed \r\nto the goal of reform of the Security Council as soon \r\nas possible. As a group of small island and low-lying \r\ncoastal developing States, CARICOM believes that \r\nsmall island developing States have a critical stake in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nand are therefore well positioned to contribute to the \r\nwork of the Council. We stand ready to work with all \r\nMember States for speedy reform of the Council.\r\nMs. Stener (Norway): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Nordic countries — Denmark, Finland, \r\nIceland, Sweden and my own country, Norway.\r\nI would like to begin by thanking the previous \r\nco-Chairs and all who have done a great job in laying \r\nthe groundwork for this discussion. Let me also thank \r\nyou, Mr. President, for initiating today’s debate and \r\nfor appointing the Permanent Representatives of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates and Georgia to lead us in our \r\ndiscussions. We are in good hands.\r\nI reaffirm the commitment of the Nordic countries to \r\nengaging in the collective efforts to reform the Security \r\nCouncil. Given the global and geopolitical challenges \r\nfacing the United Nations, ensuring the effectiveness \r\nof the Security Council is more important than ever. \r\nWe are encouraged by the momentum for reform that \r\nis currently energizing the work of the Secretariat and \r\nMember States, and we look forward to listening to and \r\nworking with other Member States from all regions in \r\nsupport of reform.\r\nThe Security Council must become more \r\ntransparent, effective, accountable and representative \r\nthan it is now. That requires reform. An important and \r\ndesirable step forward would be negotiations, based \r\non a text. The Nordic countries support a balanced \r\nexpansion of the Security Council. The aim must be \r\nto better reflect current geopolitical and economic \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 9/29\r\nrealities and ensure enhanced representation of \r\ndeveloping countries, including both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent seats for Africa. In our view, it is also \r\nimportant to ensure that small States can serve regularly \r\nas elected members of the Council.\r\nI would like to assure the Assembly that the Nordic \r\ncountries will contribute to a constructive dialogue \r\namong Member States, with a view to achieving further \r\nprogress during this session of the General Assembly.\r\nMs. King (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): I \r\nhave the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of \r\nthe L.69, a diverse group of developing countries from \r\nAfrica, Latin America and the Caribbean and Asia \r\nand the Pacific that are united by the common cause \r\nof achieving lasting and comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIn your acceptance speech (see A/71/PV.83) after \r\nyour election to preside over the Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session, Mr. President, you acknowledged that \r\nthe most widely mentioned topic related to United \r\nNations reform is reform of the Security Council. You \r\nfurther underscored that there is broad agreement that it \r\nis time to transform the Security Council into a twenty-\r\nfirst-century body, and you expressed your intention to \r\nwork closely and consult widely with Member States \r\non how to move forward the agreement that our leaders \r\nreached at the 2005 World Summit.\r\nWe would like to begin by congratulating you, Sir, for \r\ncontinuing that process and for your letter of 30 October \r\nencouraging Member States to move forward, building \r\non progress achieved in previous sessions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We welcome the appointment of our \r\ndistinguished colleagues Ambassadors Kaha Imnadze \r\nof Georgia and Lana Zaki Nusseibeh of the United Arab \r\nEmirates, and wish them every success in their efforts \r\nto move the process forward at a critical juncture. I \r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to assure you \r\nand the co-Chairs, Mr. President, of our group’s full \r\nsupport and cooperation during this session.\r\nThe United Nations has come a long way since \r\n1945. In 1979, just 14 years after the first expansion of \r\nthe Security Council, a request for a second expansion \r\nwas made to the General Assembly. The initiation of \r\nthe process for considering the agenda item relating \r\nto Security Council reform in the Assembly finally \r\nbegan in 1992. On 11 December this year, we mark the \r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the Assembly’s adoption in \r\nDecember 1992, of resolution 47/62, which requested \r\nthe Secretary-General to invite Member States to \r\nsubmit, not later than 30 June 1993, written comments \r\non a possible review of the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil. It also requested the Secretary-General to \r\nsubmit for the Assembly’s consideration at its forty-\r\neighth session a report containing comments by Member \r\nStates on the subject and decided to include on the \r\nprovisional agenda for its forty-eighth session an item \r\nentitled “Question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council”.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations process started \r\nin 2008, more than three years after our leaders at the \r\n2005 World Summit clearly stated that speedy reform \r\nof the Security Council was necessary. While the \r\ncommencement of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprovided new hope to people around the world, 10 \r\nyears later we are at a crucial juncture. Will we elect to \r\ncontinue with these so-called negotiations, which are at \r\nvariance with the way we do business here at the United \r\nNations and are a glaring exception to internationally \r\naccepted norms? The L.69 group is of the view that it \r\nis the responsibility of the entire membership of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and you, Mr. President, to prevent \r\nthat dysfunctional process from continuing. In that \r\nconnection, we welcomed your expressed intention at \r\nthe opening of the general debate in the seventy-second \r\nsession to promote a credible process to address reform \r\nof the Security Council.\r\nIf we are serious about the credibility of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, we must, with a sense of \r\nurgency, introduce standard United Nations negotiating \r\npractices into their mode of operation. Failure to do so \r\nwill not only put the entire process at risk but will also \r\nallow a minority to appropriate the process by using \r\nit as a vehicle for maintaining the status quo. That \r\nis not the purpose for which the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations were mandated. On the contrary, its \r\nmandate is to seek a solution that can achieve general \r\nagreement on the question of the Security Council’s \r\nequitable representation and increased membership. \r\nWe therefore favour a solutions-based approach to the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process.\r\nWe would like to draw the Assembly’s attention \r\nto document A/72/510, which contains a letter that the \r\nL.69 group submitted to the President of the Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session. Annexes I and II to the letter \r\ndetail the wide support for the initiation of text-based \r\nnegotiations from 164 Member States. In response to \r\nan assertion that only a few countries have engaged in \r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n10/29 17-36269\r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations process, we showed \r\nthat more than 180 have engaged in the process since \r\nit began. We have also seen attempts by some to use \r\nthe arguments for text-based negotiations to discredit \r\nother groups’ positions. The call for a negotiating text \r\nis not a demand but reflects a shared responsibility. The \r\nrequirement for a progressive and normalized process \r\nis not an achievement in and of itself, but a practical \r\nnecessity. Without a text to guide that process, without \r\na text to track the evolution and distillation of positions, \r\nwe have seen how this abnormal process can hinder the \r\nearnest attempts of Member States to engage. During \r\nthe last intergovernmental negotiations we saw how this \r\npeculiar approach creates the potential for unnecessary \r\nconfusion and inadvertent misrepresentation or \r\nmisunderstanding of Member States’ positions by \r\nvirtue of the fact that there are no records of how their \r\npositions have evolved over time.\r\nOver the years, we have discussed the five key \r\nissues ad nauseam. We have gathered and discussed \r\nand heard positions and proposals from all groups and \r\nindividual Member States many times over. Where do \r\nwe go from here? That is the question we must answer \r\nbefore we reflexively commence our next round of so-\r\ncalled negotiations on that important issue.\r\nFinally, Mr. President, you have made focusing on \r\npeople your mantra, and rightly so. We were sent here \r\nto advocate on behalf of our people. Our engagement in \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations is not an intellectual \r\nexercise. We are accountable to our taxpayers for \r\nthe use of their hard-earned dollars. In the spirit of \r\ntransparency and openness, it is time for us to at least \r\nlet the world see what we have been discussing for so \r\nmany years. They have a right to know where we are \r\nand whether we are any closer to achieving our goals. \r\nIf we are making progress, the people should see it. If \r\nwe are not, they should also be made aware of what is \r\nhindering our progress. That is the minimum that we \r\nowe to our constituents, the people of the world. In that \r\nregard, it is our young people, in particular, whose lives \r\nwill be shaped by the decisions taken by the Assembly.\r\nOur group believes that expansion in both \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership is imperative in order to better reflect \r\nthe realities of the contemporary world and achieve \r\na more accountable, representative, transparent and, \r\nmost importantly, relevant Security Council. In that \r\nregard, the issue of Africa’s representation in both \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories must be \r\naddressed by the Assembly in line with the African \r\ncommon position.\r\nIn conclusion, Mr. President, I hope that under your \r\nguidance and active engagement we will, as per your \r\nown words, move the process forward. We believe that \r\nthe measure of that commitment will be manifested \r\nby the formulation of a negotiating text that serves to \r\nre-energize the intergovernmental negotiations process \r\nand lays a basis for speedy and meaningful reform.\r\nMr. Akbaruddin (India): I would like to begin by \r\nthanking you, Mr. President, for your sterling opening \r\nremarks articulating your commitment to putting in \r\nplace a meaningful and credible reform process. They \r\nhave set the stage for our consideration of agenda item \r\n122, on the question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered earlier by the Permanent Representatives of \r\nJapan, on behalf of the nations of the Group of Four, \r\nand Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, on behalf of the \r\nL.69 group of developing countries. I would like to add \r\nsome remarks in my national capacity.\r\nWe meet for the annual consideration of this \r\nagenda item for the twenty-fifth consecutive time, even \r\nas we witness accelerating change all around us. A \r\nfuturist cataloguing change in the twenty-first century \r\nconcluded that between 2000 and 2014, the total of the \r\nchanges affecting our lives was equivalent to that of \r\nthe entire twentieth century. He also predicted that \r\naccording to his law of accelerating returns, another \r\ntwentieth century’s worth of change will happen in half \r\nthat time, by 2021. Of course, it appears that he forgot \r\nto study the practice and pursuit of this agenda item, \r\nwhich has remained unchanged for years before 2000 \r\nand years since 2014. This agenda item is indicative of \r\nthe lack of even incremental change in our approach to \r\nissues of importance, oblivious of the pace of change \r\nall around us. As multilateral diplomats, we are indeed \r\nused to punishing processes, but never has a process \r\nitself become a punishment, as in this case.\r\nIf that is the new normal, it does not bode well for \r\nmultilateralism. Never have the normative foundations \r\nof multilateral cooperation been shown to be weaker \r\nthan in this instance. If the most representative of \r\nexisting multilateral institutions can only muddle \r\nalong, holding meetings and issuing reports that are not \r\neven minor stabs at marginal improvement, and if the \r\ngap between the demand for global governance and the \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 11/29\r\nshortage of responses provided by existing multilateral \r\ninstitutions is growing, we need to ponder if what \r\nwe are witnessing is the symptoms of a recession of \r\nmultilateralism. There is no more vivid reflection \r\nof that deepening crisis of multilateralism than the \r\ndysfunctional Security Council, which no longer \r\nreflects contemporary realities and hence faces a crisis \r\nof legitimacy and credibility. Similarly, there is no \r\ngreater example of the institutional inertia that resists \r\nconstructive adaptation than the inability to translate \r\ndiscussions into a text for negotiations, despite 10 years \r\nof so-called intergovernmental negotiations authorized \r\nby the General Assembly and the Assembly’s own \r\nannual consideration of the agenda item, which has \r\ncontinued since 1993.\r\nAt a time when proliferating transnational threats, \r\ndeepening economic interdependence and worsening \r\nenvironmental degradation all call for effective \r\nmultilateral action, we have fallen short of a substantive \r\nresponse on an issue as important as reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. That is a sign that the ageing pillars \r\nof the established multilateral order are creaking and \r\ncrumbling all around us, unable to meet the need \r\nfor change.\r\nIt is axiomatic that reforms tend to generate \r\nreforms. This year, the Secretary-General has drawn up \r\na broad set of reform proposals, including in the area \r\nof peace and security. No reform of the United Nations \r\npeace and security architecture will be complete \r\nwithout reform of the Security Council. It would not \r\nbe wrong to say that an unreformed Council could in \r\nfact undermine progress that could be made in other \r\nareas of that continuum. The time is therefore ripe \r\nfor progress on Security Council reform as part of a \r\nwide-ranging agenda of reform during this session of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nSo what should we specifically do to avail ourselves \r\nof this opportunity? First, as a French Prime Minister, \r\nGeorges Clemenceau, once said, war is too important \r\nto be left to the generals. In the modern era, perhaps, \r\ndiplomacy seems to have become too important to be \r\nleft to the diplomats. That need not be a bad thing. \r\nModern challenges demand the concerted efforts not \r\nonly of Governments but of whole societies. So society \r\nmore generally could be more involved in the diplomatic \r\nprocess. Perhaps we should consider options whereby \r\nwe open up the process so that others are aware of what \r\nis stopping the current discussions from even beginning \r\non the path of a negotiating text. Transparency in the \r\nwork of diplomats is a useful adaptation that we can \r\nconsider as a pathway to progress in this changing world.\r\nSecondly, the differences between those who \r\nadvocate change and the defenders of the status quo are \r\na recurring pattern in the history of any reform effort. \r\nThe annexes to document A/72/510 detail the critical \r\nmass that is available for initiating a normal reform \r\nprocess. Having a negotiating text is not only a demand \r\nof the majority but, as the Permanent Representative \r\nof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has just said, the \r\nresponsibility of all the membership. A normalized \r\nprocess does not guarantee results by itself. It expresses \r\nthe good faith and sincerity of the entire membership. It \r\nis time to have a normal process, with a text and records \r\nof who said what, so as to help all of us understand one \r\nanother’s positions with greater clarity and respect.\r\nThirdly, I congratulate you, Mr. President, on \r\ncommencing your stewardship of that process with the \r\nwelcome appointment as co-Chairs of our colleagues \r\nAmbassadors Imnadze of Georgia and Nusseibeh of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates. We wish them success in \r\ntheir efforts. We hope that under their leadership we \r\nwill courageously move the process forward. We have \r\nhad more than our share of routines, continuity and \r\nstatements and too little of initiatives, f lexibility and \r\nresults. We call on the co-Chairs to replace routines with \r\ninitiatives, continuity with f lexibility and statements \r\nwith results. Only then will we diplomats be able to \r\ndo what the philosopher Edmund Burke paraphrased \r\nas those things that men of intelligence and goodwill \r\nwould wish, five or 10 years hence, had been done. \r\nThat opportunity lies within our grasp. As always, the \r\nchoice is ours to make.\r\nMs. Bird (Australia): I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank Ambassadors Jinga and Khiari for \r\nably leading the Security Council reform process during \r\nthe previous session and, Mr. President, to warmly \r\nwelcome your appointment of Ambassadors Imnadze \r\nand Nusseibeh as co-Chairs to take the process forward \r\nduring the seventy-second session. We wish them the \r\nbest of luck. They will need it.\r\nWhile I hesitate to start on a negative note, I \r\nmust express disappointment that there has not been \r\ngreater progress on reforming the Council. Over the \r\nprevious three sessions, we have taken constructive \r\nsteps towards the ambitious and important reforms that \r\nare needed. Discussions in that regard have provided \r\na useful foundation for reaching mutual understanding \r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n12/29 17-36269\r\nand for finding common ground. However, we have not \r\nbeen able to proceed to concrete reform on the key issue \r\nof membership.\r\nAustralia’s position on Security Council reform is \r\nwell known. We have advocated reform of the Security \r\nCouncil for many years. Reforming the Security \r\nCouncil, like reform of other elements of the United \r\nNations, is about ensuring that it is fit for purpose. It \r\nshould be seen as a necessity, not an optional extra. \r\nTo be relevant and effective, the Council should \r\nbetter reflect contemporary geopolitical realities, \r\nwith greater representation for Asia, Africa and Latin \r\nAmerica. We support expansion in the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. Such expansion should \r\nnot inhibit the Council’s ability to act swiftly and \r\ndecisively but should take place within limits and \r\nbe accompanied by improvements to the Council’s \r\nworking methods. Australia has long held that the \r\nCouncil’s working methods should reflect greater \r\ntransparency, better coordination with the General \r\nAssembly and better consultation with troop- and \r\npolice-contributing countries.\r\nAustralia also urges all Member States, especially \r\nthe permanent five, to commit to the code of conduct of \r\nthe Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group \r\nand the complementary French-Mexican declaration, \r\nwhich calls for restraint in the use of the veto in \r\nsituations of mass atrocity. Those two related initiatives \r\nhave formed one of the few welcome concrete steps \r\ntaken towards Council reform in recent years.\r\nWe welcome the practical measures identified in \r\nthe paper entitled “Elements of convergence on two \r\nkey issues of Security Council reform: the relationship \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly, and \r\nthe size of an enlarged Security Council and working \r\nmethods of the Council” and the subsequent paper \r\nentitled, “Elements of commonality and issues for \r\nfurther consideration on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters”. We now \r\nurge Member States to move towards implementation \r\nwithout delay. That includes moving to text-based \r\nnegotiations, which would build momentum and \r\ndemonstrate our commitment to delivering these \r\nreforms. If we collectively fail to take this next step, \r\nand simply reiterate well-known positions again, it \r\nwill bring this reform process into question. If the end \r\nproduct of our deliberations is yet another “Elements” \r\npaper, the credibility and relevance of the process will \r\nbe in doubt.\r\nThe Security Council must uphold its mandate \r\nto maintain international peace and security. We \r\nacknowledge that it can act effectively when necessary. \r\nWe note in particular its response to the recent \r\nprovocations by North Korea. But the Security Council, \r\nlike other parts of the multilateral architecture, must \r\nbe able to adjust to changes in the global landscape. \r\nIt cannot operate in a vacuum. It is necessary for the \r\ncredibility of the United Nations that we undertake \r\nmeaningful reform of the Council, especially on the \r\ncrucial issue of membership.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): Deteriorating \r\nhumanitarian situations threaten regional and \r\ninternational stability. The possible atrocity crimes in \r\nMyanmar, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere demand unified \r\naction by the Security Council to provide peace, \r\nsecurity and accountability. The Council, one of the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, is equipped with \r\npowerful tools to alleviate human suffering and enforce \r\npeace and stability. But it frequently fails to live up to \r\nthe expectations that people around the globe have for \r\nit. All too often, it is unable to use the powerful tools \r\nit was given under the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThat undermines perceptions not just of the Council \r\nitself but of the United Nations as an organization.\r\nThe pressing need for Security Council reform is \r\nbeyond dispute. We have all said that time and again, \r\nincluding at the highest political levels. In the area \r\nof enlargement, however, there can be no prospect of \r\nprogress as long as the deeply entrenched views on the \r\nopposing sides of the discussion prevail. Without any \r\nindication of f lexibility, it is hard to imagine a way \r\nforward. Indeed, we must challenge the fundamentals \r\nof the process we are engaged in. We thank our \r\ncolleagues from the United Arab Emirates and from \r\nGeorgia for taking up the difficult challenge of leading \r\nour discussions. We will give them our full support, \r\nand we hope that they will be innovative and bold in \r\ntheir work.\r\nAs is well known, we have suggested an enlargement \r\nmodel that we hope could provide a middle ground \r\nin the discussion, adding long-term Council seats of \r\neight to ten years with the possibility of immediate \r\nre-election. The other main elements of our proposal \r\nare no new veto powers, a strong review clause and a \r\nf lip-f lop clause that bars Member States that have lost \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 13/29\r\nan election for long-term seats from running for short-\r\nterm seats.\r\nEnlargement of the Council does not equal reform. \r\nWho serves on the Council is certainly an essential \r\nquestion for how it is perceived and its credibility. \r\nHow the Council goes about its daily business and \r\ncarries out its functions is no less important. Together \r\nwith like-minded States, we have worked consistently \r\nto help the Council do better in that respect, and we \r\nhave achieved significant results. The creation of an \r\nombudsperson for the Al-Qaida and Taliban sanctions \r\nregime, for example, was an initiative that had its \r\norigins outside the Security Council.\r\nAnother key initiative in that respect is the code of \r\nconduct on Council action on mass atrocity crimes. We \r\nhad the honour to lead the efforts of the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency group that led to the \r\ncode of conduct, which so far has been embraced by \r\n114 States, all of which are committed to taking action \r\nto end and prevent atrocity crimes when serving as \r\nCouncil members. They will do so by committing to \r\ntaking action to that effect and also by not opposing \r\ncredible proposals suggested in the Council to that end. \r\nRecent situations of relevance to this issue include those \r\nin Myanmar, South Sudan and Yemen, to name just a \r\nfew. We have been gratified to see that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has submitted relevant information to the \r\nSecurity Council for action. The Council, however, \r\nhas been frustratingly slow to respond. We believe \r\nthat subscribing to the code of conduct is the minimum \r\ncommitment we should be able to expect from any \r\nCouncil member. In future, therefore, we will support \r\ncandidatures for the Security Council only from States \r\nthat have signed the code of conduct. We also call on \r\nall States that have not yet done so to join the code of \r\nconduct as soon as possible.\r\nMr. Inguanez (Malta): Malta aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered earlier by the representative \r\nof Italy on behalf of the Uniting for Consensus group. \r\nI would like to add the following remarks in my \r\nnational capacity.\r\nWe would also like to join others in thanking \r\nyou, Mr. President, for initiating this debate, \r\nand in congratulating the new co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform for this session. We would like to assure them \r\nof Malta’s support and constructive engagement in \r\nthe process.\r\nReform of the Security Council is a delicate and \r\nsensitive dossier. We are under no illusion as to the \r\nmagnitude of the challenge. There is no doubt that \r\nstrategic interests are at stake, which renders the \r\nprocess slow and wearing. That is inherent in the \r\nissues of reform under consideration, but we should not \r\nbe deterred from taking an inclusive and transparent \r\napproach. On the contrary, that is perhaps even more \r\nessential. The more we debate, the more we explore \r\nideas and the more we come to realize the short- and \r\nlong-term implications of what we are talking about. \r\nWe hold that it is not here or through a text that we will \r\nhave the opportunity and the time to truly understand \r\nthe effects, operational difficulties and implications of \r\nthe proposals on the table. It is not here that we will \r\nhave the time to analyse the repercussions of our ideas \r\nin depth. Rather, it is only through time itself that \r\ntrue, calm and objective reflection can take place on \r\nthe complexities involved and their potential future \r\nimpact. It is time that will enable the discussions to \r\nevolve and reach maturity. It is time that will enable \r\nMember States to reflect on and comprehend how \r\nmultilateral diplomacy will unfold in the years to come \r\nby supporting one option over another.\r\nIn the meantime, in a positive and constructive \r\nspirit, the Uniting for Consensus group has sought to \r\ndevelop over the years a proposal that takes a consensus \r\napproach. It has tried to reach out to all States and include \r\ntheir concerns, while not prejudicing what we believe to \r\nbe the essential principles of reform. The reform process \r\nis a Member State-driven exercise and a painstaking \r\none. Malta acknowledges that what we discuss in the \r\nprocess reflects on the United Nations membership \r\ncollectively and individually. Besides that, we affirm \r\nthat what we discuss here affects and goes beyond \r\nMember States’ interests and positions. It is therefore \r\nimportant to ensure that in the quest for ways to make \r\nthe Organization reflect today’s realities, we do not \r\nneglect the fundamental aims of reform — optimizing \r\nits organic democracy, accountability, transparency, \r\neffectiveness and representation. This reform exercise \r\nis about sowing the seeds, whether we agree on them \r\nor not, for a new multilateral order. Only in that \r\nway can we recalibrate the system without creating \r\nnew imbalances.\r\nMalta believes that the aim of our reform \r\nshould be first and foremost an equitable increase in \r\nrepresentation with respect to Member States within \r\nan enlarged Council, bearing in mind today’s new \r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n14/29 17-36269\r\nrealities. But in doing so, we should also recalibrate \r\nwith regard to the whole of the United Nations \r\nmembership — big, medium-sized and small States. \r\nSmall States have a particular interest in seeing to it \r\nthat future multilateralism leaves enough ground for \r\nthem. Small States have an interest in seeing that the \r\nmultilateral framework will not end up composed of a \r\nwider, if stronger, core and a weaker periphery. Small \r\nStates want to play their part, but not on the fringes. \r\nWe are cognizant of the difficulties involved. However, \r\nwe remain full of hope that pragmatism will win over. \r\nNothing can hinder us from working to find out in \r\npractical terms what we can achieve together, what we \r\ncan improve and to what extent we can do that. With that \r\nin mind, we look forward to this year’s negotiations.\r\nMr. Ja Song Nam (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): I would first like to express my appreciation \r\nfor the efforts of the representatives of Romania and \r\nTunisia as last year’s co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform.\r\nThe issue of Council reform is an important and \r\npressing matter, given the currently complicated \r\ninternational situation, and we need it if we are to build \r\na world of peace and stability. Today, the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international relations — equality, \r\nsovereignty and mutual respect — as laid down in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations are being seriously \r\nviolated. Sovereign States are being openly subjected \r\nto interference, military intervention and massacres \r\nin the international arena. Under the pretexts of \r\nso-called non-proliferation and counter-terrorism, \r\nState-sponsored terrorism and plots against sovereign \r\nStates are becoming more blatant. Terrorist forces are \r\nbeing formed on a global scale, and the catastrophic \r\nconsequences of that are leading to a disastrous \r\nrefugee situation.\r\nSituations such as these, which seriously affect \r\nworld peace and security, are caused by the United \r\nStates, which uses its privileged position as a permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council and its political clout to \r\nimplement its strategy for world dominance. The United \r\nStates, the biggest nuclear Power in the world, has \r\ncontinued to make historically unprecedented nuclear \r\nthreats against the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea and has denounced the security measures \r\nwe have taken as a threat to international peace \r\nand security while it continues to impose unlawful \r\nsanctions and resolutions one after another. Even more \r\nserious, the Security Council, which is responsible for \r\nworld peace and security, has turned a blind eye to \r\nthe nuclear threats and nuclear-war exercises that the \r\nUnited States has conducted against the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea for half a century, and has \r\nnot taken a single measure to ensure peace and security \r\non the Korean peninsula.\r\nI also strongly condemn the remarks just made by \r\nthe representative of Australia about the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. That country merely plays to \r\nthe tune of the United States without knowing anything \r\nof the reality of the situation on the Korean peninsula.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea insists on total Security Council reform. We \r\nclarify our principled position as follows. First, reform \r\nof the Security Council should focus on ensuring \r\nimpartiality, objectivity and democracy. Activities \r\nsuch as the adoption of resolutions that justify and \r\nlegitimize the aggression of certain countries against \r\nothers, in violation of truth and justice, should no \r\nlonger be tolerated.\r\nSecondly, Security Council reform should ensure \r\nthe full representation of members of the Movement \r\nof Non-Aligned Countries (NAM), as well as of \r\ndeveloping countries. There can be no question that the \r\nmore than 120 NAM and developing countries, which \r\nrepresent a majority in the United Nations, should \r\nhave full representation on the Security Council. As \r\nwe can see from the results of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, although 10 years have passed since the \r\nissue of expanding the Security Council was first \r\naddressed, the situation remains unchanged, owing \r\nto various countries’ conflicting views. Under these \r\ncircumstances, the only way to adjust the imbalance in \r\nthe Council is to increase the number of non-permanent \r\nseats on it.\r\nJapan’s efforts to achieve permanent membership \r\non the Security Council should never be tolerated. \r\nJapan is a major criminal State, having militarily \r\ninvaded many Asian countries and committed heinous, \r\nunimaginable crimes against humanity and crimes of \r\nsexual slavery in particular. The fact that Japan, which \r\nis denying such inhumane crimes and is now showing \r\ntendencies towards militarism, is seeking a permanent \r\nseat on the Council is grotesque and an open affront to \r\nthe international community.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea has thus clarified its principled position on \r\nSecurity Council reform and expresses the hope that \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 15/29\r\nthe international community’s protracted efforts to \r\nreform the Security Council will bear fruit in future.\r\nMr. Skinner-Klée Arenales (Guatemala) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): At the outset, I would like to warmly \r\ncongratulate the Permanent Representatives of Georgia \r\nand the United Arab Emirates on their appointment \r\nas co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We are confident that under \r\ntheir leadership and given their abilities, we will be \r\nable to make progress in reaching consensus on this \r\nvital issue. I would of course also like to express our \r\ngratitude for the good work done previously by the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Tunisia and Romania \r\nand for the elements of consensus that they were able to \r\nprovide in past negotiations.\r\nMy delegation renews its commitment to ensuring \r\nthat the Security Council reform process is participatory, \r\nexhaustive, transparent, equitable and, above all, viable \r\nand adaptable to today’s world and its challenges. \r\nInstitutions cannot remain static or paralysed at this \r\nhistoric time. Rather, they should be prepared for \r\nchange and for evolving effectively in order to face \r\nthe circumstances and the challenges to which they \r\nmust respond. Without question, the global political \r\nand economic reality of 1945 is not commensurate with \r\nthe current reality; nor is that of 1965. It is therefore \r\nappropriate and urgent that we review the structure and \r\nfunctioning of the Council. We believe the Council must \r\nhave sufficient f lexibility and the capacity to respond \r\nto current challenges and that it must be efficient, \r\nrepresentative and transparent. If we want the Council \r\nto maintain its validity and legitimacy and to carry out \r\nthe responsibilities assigned to it under the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, we must be willing to accept that \r\nmaintaining the status quo is not an option.\r\nIn that connection, the main goal of the reform \r\nshould be to ensure that the Security Council can respond \r\nappropriately to any threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity in the current global situation. However, inertia \r\nand paralysis prevail, thereby exposing the Council to a \r\nprogressive loss of relevance and revealing its obstinate \r\nfailure to act in the face of the normative power of the \r\nfacts — the realpolitik — which poses a greater threat \r\nto the world order.\r\nThat paralysis has become increasingly evident, \r\nfor example, with the use or threat of use of the veto \r\nby the permanent members of the Security Council. \r\nFar from supporting the defence of the collective \r\ninterest with arguments that facilitate consensus, \r\nthe non-acquiescence of the permanent members \r\nhas obstructed and distorted the common interest, \r\nwhich in turn foments division among the members \r\nof the Council, leading to an abdication of the serious \r\nresponsibilities that fall to it. Moreover, over time \r\nwe have found that the concerns expressed by many \r\ndelegations during the San Francisco Conference in \r\n1945 regarding the veto were completely valid and \r\njustify further consideration of that issue. That is \r\nwhy Guatemala questions whether the veto should be \r\nallowed at all, even if other States seek that power \r\nwithin the framework of Security Council reform. One \r\napproach to circumvent the veto problem can be found \r\nin the proposals of France and Mexico with regard to \r\na declaration to restrict the use of the veto, with the \r\nadditional guidance of a code of conduct regarding the \r\naction that the Security Council should ideally take in \r\ncases of genocide, crimes against humanity and war \r\ncrimes. We believe that the contribution made by those \r\ndelegations represents a valuable alternative.\r\nWe know that any change is difficult, and that is \r\nwhy we believe that the intergovernmental negotiation \r\nprocess should seek to make gradual progress in a \r\nprogressive reform process that includes the membership \r\nand working methods of the Security Council. Only \r\nwith the commitment and political will of all Member \r\nStates, without impositions, can we achieve that goal. \r\nOur collective approach must be aimed at achieving \r\na viable and practical agreement through a process in \r\nwhich we are all willing to be f lexible and transparent. \r\nOnly that would allow the Security Council to adapt to \r\ncurrent and future circumstances.\r\nMr. Vieira (Brazil): Brazil associates itself with \r\nthe statement made by the Permanent Representative \r\nof Japan on behalf of the Group of Four, and by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines on behalf of the L.69 group, and would like \r\nto add the following comments in its national capacity.\r\nThis session’s debate on this agenda item is \r\nparticularly timely, as it takes place during broader \r\ndiscussions of reforms that the Secretary-General \r\nwishes to implement within the United Nations. The \r\nneed to modernize the United Nations and put it in a \r\nbetter position to address current challenges underlies \r\nthose proposals. We expect that those reforms will \r\ninclude a democratization of the United Nations system, \r\nwhich will not be achieved unless the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council takes place. We were pleased that this \r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n16/29 17-36269\r\nJanuary, in Addis Ababa, Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres reiterated the assessment by his predecessor \r\nKofi Annan that “no reform of the United Nations will \r\nbe complete without the reform of the Security Council”. \r\nAny attempt to reform the United Nations and bring its \r\nstructures in line with current realities cannot overlook \r\nthe reform of the Security Council.\r\nIn this year’s opening meeting of the general \r\ndebate, President Michel Temer also underscored \r\nthe imperative of reforming the United Nations. He \r\nhighlighted that\r\n“it is particularly necessary to enlarge the Security \r\nCouncil to adapt it to the realities of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. It is urgent that we listen to the will of the \r\noverwhelming majority of the General Assembly.” \r\n(A/72/PV.3, p.7).\r\nBrazil was not alone in underlining the urgent \r\nneed for Security Council reform in the general debate. \r\nA significant number of countries also expressed \r\nconcern about the outdated structure of the current \r\ncomposition of the Council and mentioned the need \r\nto adjust it to contemporary realities. Many pointed \r\nto its inefficiency and paralysis in dealing with the \r\nmost pressing challenges to peace and security. That \r\nposes a great risk to its credibility and legitimacy. \r\nIt is noteworthy that the vast majority of such \r\nstatements come from developing countries, which are \r\nunderrepresented in the most powerful decision-making \r\norgan of the United Nations. It is past time to redress \r\nthat underrepresentation — especially that of African \r\ncountries, the only continent not to have a permanent \r\nseat in the Council.\r\nWe welcome your commitment, Sir, at the opening \r\nof this session’s general debate to “promote a credible \r\nprocess to address the reform of the Security Council” \r\n(A/72/PV.3, p.6). Brazil congratulates the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Romania, Ambassador Ion Jinga, and \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Tunisia, Ambassador \r\nMohammed Khaled Khiari, on their work as co-Chairs \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform during the previous session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and welcomes the appointment of \r\nAmbassadors Kaha Imnadze of Georgia and Lana Zaki \r\nNusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates as co-Chairs \r\nfor the current session. As always, they can count on \r\nBrazil’s full support in their endeavour.\r\nBrazil expects the General Assembly at the \r\ncurrent session to build on the progress made during \r\nthe sixty-ninth, seventieth and seventy-first sessions. \r\nThe documents produced by the co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during those sessions \r\nform a solid basis for text-based negotiations, which \r\nis the next logical step in the process. The previous \r\nyears’ exercises showed that convergence is possible \r\nand helped us to identify where the widest gaps remain. \r\nWe should not refrain, however, from drafting a concise \r\ndocument that also reflects competing views. That is \r\nprecisely what negotiation is about: an attempt to find \r\ncommon ground on areas where we do not necessarily \r\nconverge. We expect to see text-based negotiations \r\nlaunched during the current session with a view to \r\nleading the intergovernmental negotiations towards a \r\nlong-overdue concrete outcome.\r\nMs. Azucena (Philippines): We wish to thank \r\nyou, Mr. President, for convening this plenary debate \r\nto discuss the important question of reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. The Philippines supports the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s reaffirmation of its central role \r\nin that matter and its resolve to continue negotiations \r\nimmediately. We count on your leadership to ensure \r\ncontinuity with the progress that has been achieved \r\nover the past years.\r\nWe also wish to take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Georgia and the United \r\nArab Emirates for having been appointed recently as \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We are confident that they \r\nwill exert every effort to carry the negotiations forward \r\nfor the benefit of all Member States.\r\nI would like to reiterate the support of the Philippines \r\nfor an enlarged Security Council with an increase in the \r\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent, or elected, \r\nmembers of the Security Council. The Philippines \r\nsupports the proposal to increase the number of \r\nCouncil members to up to 27. We believe that a broader \r\nmembership would better reflect twenty-first century \r\ngeopolitical realities and contribute to the pursuit of \r\nthe Council’s mandate to maintain international peace \r\nand security.\r\nCritical to an enlarged Security Council is the \r\nbalance in geographical representation, taking into \r\naccount the size of the populations of regional groups. \r\nWe must ensure that the Council is the one venue where \r\nthe voices of all peoples of the world are heard. In that \r\ncontext, I wish to highlight the situation of the Group \r\nof Asia-Pacific States. The Group accounts for almost \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 17/29\r\n60 per cent of the total population of all States Members \r\nof the United Nations. Moreover, with 54 Member \r\nStates, it accounts for 28 per cent of the total United \r\nNations membership. In peacekeeping operations all \r\nover the world, the Asia-Pacific countries contribute \r\nabout 40 per cent of the total human resources needed \r\nto run those operations. Yet in the Security Council the \r\nGroup accounts for only 20 per cent of the total number \r\nof seats, that is, only three seats — one permanent, two \r\nelected — out of the 15 seats. We should address that \r\nunderrepresentation so as to ensure that the Security \r\nCouncil is truly representative of the interests of the \r\npeoples of the world.\r\nAn equally critical challenge that an enlarged \r\nSecurity Council has to tackle is how to remain \r\neffective and efficient. An enlarged Council must be \r\nable to act swiftly and decisively, with the highest \r\nstandards of accountability, coherence, transparency \r\nand fidelity to the trust accorded to it by the greater \r\nUnited Nations membership. While any expansion could \r\npose challenges to the effectiveness and efficiency of \r\nthe Council, my delegation believes that prioritizing \r\nkey issues, particularly the reform and improvement of \r\nthe working methods of the Council, could provide an \r\nantidote to any of those concerns.\r\nThe Philippines also reiterates its view that the veto \r\npower has no place in a twenty-first century Security \r\nCouncil. No Member State should be granted the special \r\nprivilege to exercise the veto power, as that is in direct \r\ncontravention of the principle of the sovereign equality \r\nof all Member States, as enshrined in the Charter. We \r\nappreciate that the question of the veto is the most \r\nformidable challenge in our work to reform the Security \r\nCouncil. While the abolition of the veto continues to be \r\nour aspiration, we should all be prepared to take small \r\nsteps that will hopefully bring us closer to that goal. To \r\nthat end, the Philippines is open to considering ways to \r\nrationalize the use of the veto power by the Council’s \r\npermanent members. We support the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency Group’s code of conduct \r\nand the French-Mexican initiative, which spells out \r\nexceptions to the right to use the veto power. We \r\nalso support the proposal that the extension of the \r\nright of the veto to new permanent Council members \r\nwill be decided upon in the framework of a review. \r\nWe understand that to mean that the new permanent \r\nmembers shall not exercise the veto until such review \r\nis concluded.\r\nOver the years, there has already been a significant \r\namount of work undertaken on Security Council reform. \r\nIt is about time that our serious efforts lead to concrete \r\nresults. The Philippines believes that the immediate \r\ncommencement of text-based negotiations, as called for \r\nby many Member States, is a step in the right direction. \r\nWe see it as a way to attain our aspiration for a truly \r\nrepresentative and effective Security Council.\r\nMr. Masuku (Swaziland): Here we are at yet \r\nanother session of many in which the item before \r\nus today is under discussion. I applaud the General \r\nAssembly for consistently keeping this matter under its \r\nfocus, and I also commend the previous co-Chairs of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform for the work they have done so far to achieve \r\nprogress in the debate on the issue. In the same vein, we \r\nwelcome the incoming co-Chairs, and we pledge our \r\nsupport as they take on their monumental task.\r\nWe align ourselves with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of the Republic of Sierra Leone on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States, and we welcome \r\nthis opportunity to elaborate further on the matter in \r\nour national capacity.\r\nThe Security Council plays a key role in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. It \r\nis the arm of the United Nations that has been given \r\nimportant and far-reaching powers to act on behalf \r\nof the broader membership of the United Nations. \r\nIt acts on our behalf and is meant to represent the \r\ninterests of all. It is therefore crucial that the Security \r\nCouncil be reformed so that it can reflect the realities \r\nof the twenty-first century, which would make the \r\nCouncil more democratic, legitimate, representative, \r\nresponsive and transparent in its working methods \r\nand decision-making processes. In that vein, I wish to \r\nreiterate the commitment of my delegation to this very \r\nimportant issue. We look forward to working with all \r\nMember States in building on the gains made thus far \r\nand to achieving consensus on the issues before us.\r\nNotwithstanding the regrettably prolonged \r\nnature of the reform process, the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform have helped \r\nto illuminate the various positions that have been held \r\nby the various groupings of Member States. Certain \r\nareas where there is a convergence of views have been \r\nidentified and, conversely, areas of divergence have \r\nalso been highlighted. However, no matter how brilliant \r\nthose views may be, they require further deliberation so \r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n18/29 17-36269\r\nas to ensure progress towards inclusivity. It is therefore \r\nincumbent upon us to find the means to move from the \r\ncurrent position of seeming deadlock and give fresh \r\nimpetus to the reform process.\r\nTo that end, we reiterate the position of the Group of \r\nAfrican States as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus \r\nand Sirte Declaration. It is only reasonable for Africa \r\nto be represented in the permanent-member category of \r\nthe Security Council. Not only is the Council’s agenda \r\nmainly concentrated on Africa, but such representation \r\nwould also be a true expression of democratic practice. \r\nFor a continent with 54 Member States, that is only fair. \r\nIn spite of the fact that there are some who are at odds \r\nwith that claim, we appeal to their moral sensibilities \r\nto consider the right thing. Is it fair to say that some \r\nare of no concern in the face of the injustice of history? \r\nA bit of empathy does not compromise anything. \r\nThe principle of regional representation should rule \r\nsupreme in this matter, in particular for the simple \r\nreason that the Security Council should resemble the \r\ncharacter of the General Assembly, an Assembly that \r\nreveres the Charter, made famous by its statement, “We \r\nthe peoples of the United Nations”.\r\nIt is also our resolve to stand behind the increase \r\nof membership in the non-permanent category. It is \r\nimmaterial how big the expansion is, but the details \r\nshould reflect the geopolitical realities of the world \r\ntoday. The Security Council cannot be a dogmatic \r\nbody, and the stature of its current membership brings \r\ninto question the modernity and credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWith regard to the allocation of veto privileges, \r\nwe fully subscribe to the prescription in the African \r\nCommon Position. The veto should be extended to all \r\nnew members in the permanent category as long as \r\nthat power exists. Alternatively, we are comfortable \r\nwith its abolition. However, to put everything into \r\nperspective, it is the feeling of my delegation that the \r\nveto is not in itself harmful; however, it is so within its \r\ncurrent operational confines. In recent years, decorum \r\nhas prevailed, but we are also mindful and similarly \r\nfearful of a once-in-a-century obstinacy rearing its \r\nhead. Do we then curtail or re-engineer the use of the \r\nveto and prescribe certain operational parameters? \r\nDoes it still retain its name after that? Those and other \r\nquestions require further probing. In conclusion, we \r\npray for a way forward sooner rather than later, and \r\nwill endeavour to be progressive in the discussion of \r\nthe matter. We call upon all our fellow Member States \r\nto adopt a similar approach.\r\nMr. Skinner-Kleé Arenales (Guatemala), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nMr. Sukhee (Mongolia): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to join many others in expressing our sincere \r\nappreciation for the convening of this important \r\nmeeting and in welcoming the appointment of \r\nAmbassador Nusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates and \r\nAmbassador Imnadze of Georgia as the new co-Chairs \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations. I wish to assure \r\nthem of our delegation’s full support and cooperation \r\nwith the aim of moving that process forward in our \r\nshared endeavour to reform the Security Council. My \r\ndelegation aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nearlier by Ambassador King of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines on behalf of the L.69 group and wishes to \r\nadd a few remarks in its national capacity.\r\nMy delegation shares the view that we should \r\ncontinue moving the process forward through \r\nnegotiations, building on the work of previous sessions \r\nand the framework document and its annex, as well \r\nas the elements of convergence paper on two key \r\nissues of the reform. Mongolia also believes that the \r\nSecurity Council should be reformed to make it more \r\naccountable, representative, transparent, efficient and \r\neffective. It is therefore important that, based on those \r\ncommon elements and positions, we begin the process \r\ntowards the path of text-based negotiations.\r\nIn a Member State-driven process, the call by \r\nMember States to have all views respected and reflected \r\nin a negotiating text is something that can be addressed \r\nonly with a clear road map for progress in that process \r\nand a structured approach aimed at concrete results. As \r\nsuch, the intergovernmental negotiations process has \r\nan important role to play, and we join others today in \r\ncalling for the commencement of text-based negotiations \r\nwithout further delay, taking into account the fact that \r\nan overwhelming majority supports expansion in both \r\nthe permanent and the non-permanent categories of the \r\nmembership of the Security Council.\r\nI would also like to reaffirm our principled position \r\nconcerning the reform of the Security Council on three \r\nkey issues. Regarding the categories of membership, \r\nMongolia has consistently stood for a just and equitable \r\nexpansion in both the permanent and the non-permanent \r\ncategories. Our stance in favour of an enlargement of \r\nboth of the current categories is guided by and based on \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 19/29\r\nthe composition set forth in the Charter of the United \r\nNations and is reflective of contemporary realities, as \r\nwell as the principles of justice and equality, in order \r\nto ensure the greater and enhanced representation \r\nof developing countries, particularly the non- and \r\nunderrepresented regional groups.\r\nWith respect to the question of the veto, it is our \r\nview that the veto should be abolished. We could also \r\nsupport the restricted use of the veto power in the \r\nSecurity Council, in particular with regard to decisions \r\nrelating to Chapter VII of the Charter. So long as it \r\nexists, the veto power should be extended to all new \r\nmembers in the permanent category of the Security \r\nCouncil, which must enjoy all the prerogatives and \r\nprivileges of the current permanent membership.\r\nOn the key issue of regional representation, \r\nadequate representation of all regions, particularly \r\nnon- and underrepresented, in both of the categories \r\nof the Security Council must be duly considered. \r\nThe solution should to be fair and just. We therefore \r\nattach high importance to the criterion of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution, with an emphasis on the non- \r\nand underrepresented groups, particularly Africa, Asia \r\nand the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States. \r\nAs to the non-permanent category, strengthening a fair \r\nand equitable rotation system within a geographical \r\nregional group is an important issue for my delegation. \r\nIn that respect, my delegation also supports the addition \r\nof seats to the current regional groups, specifically \r\nwith a view to ensuring the representation of small \r\ndeveloping States.\r\nIn conclusion, it is our firm belief that only \r\nthrough genuine text-based negotiations will we find \r\nconvergences and bridge our differences so as to achieve \r\na meaningful and early reform of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Gafoor (Singapore): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident for convening this plenary meeting early \r\nin his presidency and for giving priority to the issue \r\nof Security Council reform. We welcome the active \r\nengagement of the President in that important process.\r\nI join previous speakers in congratulating \r\nAmbassador Kaha Imnadze of Georgia and Ambassador \r\nLana Zaki Nusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates \r\non their appointment as the new co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. We are confident that they will continue to lead \r\nthe work of the intergovernmental negotiations in an \r\ninclusive, transparent and efficient manner, and that we \r\nwill make progress under their leadership.\r\nWe would also like to place on record our \r\nappreciation to the former co-Chairs, Ambassador Ion \r\nJinga of Romania and Ambassador Mohamed Khaled \r\nKhiari of Tunisia. Their excellent work during the last \r\nround of intergovernmental negotiations culminated in \r\nan important paper on the elements of commonality and \r\nissues for further consideration. I commend both of them \r\nfor their leadership and hard work. The paper that they \r\nprepared builds on the work of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations over the past two years. Together with the \r\nframework document and the elements of convergence \r\npaper, their latest paper provides a good foundation for \r\nour work in the intergovernmental negotiations at the \r\nseventy-second session of the General Assembly.\r\nAs we resume another year of negotiations under the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process, it is important \r\nto keep in mind a few facts. The intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations started to function in 2009. Before the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process, the open-\r\nended working group was launched in 1993. In \r\nother words, we have been discussing the issue for a \r\nquarter of a century, as many previous speakers have \r\nmentioned. No one expects that such a difficult issue \r\ncan be resolved overnight. But nor is it reasonable or \r\ncredible to expect the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess to continue for another quarter of a century \r\nwithout any results to show.\r\nAllow me to put it starkly — is the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process a help or hindrance to the \r\nreform process? The answer depends on whether \r\nthat process is able to deliver concrete progress. If \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations process is able to \r\ndemonstrate progress, it will be regarded with respect \r\nand credibility. However, if it is not able to, there will \r\nbe serious questions as to the value of continuing the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process.\r\nIf we are serious about reforming the Security \r\nCouncil, we need to inject a greater sense of urgency \r\ninto our work and aim to reach a real negotiating \r\nprocess. We cannot treat that process as an annual \r\nritual that serves merely to keep delegations busy \r\nand preoccupied. Ultimately, Security Council reform \r\nis the key to maintaining the relevance and credibility \r\nof the United Nations system as a whole. If the Security \r\nCouncil continues to operate in a business-as-usual \r\nmanner, it will be unable to deal effectively with \r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n20/29 17-36269\r\nthe intractable challenges that we all face in today’s \r\ncomplex global environment.\r\nAs a small State, Singapore has always been a firm \r\nadvocate and defender of a rules-based, multilateral \r\nsystem. The role of the Security Council is critical in \r\nsuch a system. We therefore attach great importance to \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations process, because we \r\nwant a transparent, accountable and effective Security \r\nCouncil. As a small State, Singapore does not stand to \r\nbenefit directly from any particular model of reform \r\nor Security Council expansion. What we seek is the \r\nstrengthening of the multilateral system. Singapore’s \r\nposition on Security Council reform is clear.\r\nFirst, we believe in making the Council \r\nmore representative and inclusive. We support an \r\nexpanded membership in both the permanent and \r\nthe non-permanent categories of membership in the \r\nCouncil. That is necessary, in our view, if we are to \r\nensure that the composition of the Council embodies \r\nthe diverse membership of the United Nations as it \r\nexists today.\r\nSecondly, reform should make the Council more \r\naccountable, transparent and inclusive for all Member \r\nStates. In particular, the reform process should not \r\ndisadvantage small States in their efforts to seek election \r\nto the Security Council. For many small countries like \r\nSingapore, that factor is important, as we do not have \r\nmany opportunities to serve in the Council.\r\nThirdly, our work must make the Council more \r\neffective in dealing with the many challenges that it \r\nfaces today. All that Singapore needs and expects of \r\nthe Security Council is that it be able to act swiftly and \r\ndecisively when confronted by global crises. What we \r\ndo not want is a Security Council that is paralysed by \r\npolitical divisions or prevented from acting by the use \r\nof the veto.\r\nAs we embark on the current session of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, we need to build on the \r\nexcellent work of the previous co-Chairs and sustain \r\nthe momentum for progress. The paper prepared \r\nby the co-Chairs at the previous intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations session was an important outcome, as \r\nit identified in one consolidated document the key \r\nelements of commonality on all five clusters of issues \r\npursuant to decision 62/557, and it also listed other issues \r\nthat merit further reflection and discussion. We need to \r\nuse that paper to take our work forward. Allow me, in \r\nthat connection, to make some suggestions, which may \r\nhelp to guide our work during the upcoming session.\r\nFirst, we need to look anew at the elements of \r\ncommonality and identify areas in which we can take \r\nadvantage of the progress already made. For example, \r\nsome of the elements of convergence relating to the \r\nworking methods of the Security Council and its \r\nrelationship with the General Assembly are already in \r\nthe process of being implemented, such as an increase \r\nin the number of open meetings of the Council, the \r\nregular meetings between the Presidents of the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, and the submission \r\nof annual reports by the Security Council.\r\nIn that regard, we welcomed the adoption of the \r\nrevised Security Council presidential note S/2010/507, \r\nwhich builds on previous Security Council efforts \r\nto improve the Council’s working methods and to \r\nenhance its efficiency and transparency, as well as the \r\ninteraction and dialogue with non-Council members \r\nand bodies. There is scope for the General Assembly to \r\nacknowledge and formalize those improvements so that \r\nthey become standard work procedures, rather than ad \r\nhoc, informal measures taken by the Council. In our \r\nview, there are some practical steps that we can take \r\nnow, without making any amendments to the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, with a view to improving the \r\npractices of the Security Council.\r\nSecondly, we should continue our discussions \r\non issues that have been identified for further \r\nconsideration. There will naturally be differing points \r\nof view and perspectives, but that should not prevent \r\nus from having an open and frank discussion of the \r\nissues. We should attempt to narrow differences, try to \r\nbroaden the elements of commonality, and hopefully \r\ninclude new areas of convergence. In that regard, we \r\nwould support entering into substantive negotiations \r\nby putting ideas and proposals on paper and having a \r\nfocused debate on those ideas and proposals.\r\nThirdly, we should revisit some of the issues \r\nthat enjoyed strong support but were not ultimately \r\nincluded in the paper prepared by the co-Chairs last \r\nyear as points of commonality. One issue that could \r\nbe considered for inclusion as a point of commonality \r\nis the growing support for the limitation of the use of \r\nthe veto in cases involving mass atrocities. A majority \r\nof Member States support that proposal, and, as far as \r\nwe recall, no delegation expressly objected to it at the \r\nprevious intergovernmental negotiations session. In our \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 21/29\r\nview, we should take an inclusive approach and work \r\nto improve the co-Chairs’ paper with new points of \r\ncommonality, particularly when there is strong support \r\nfor them.\r\nThe suggestions that we have just made are aimed \r\nat advancing the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess. As we have said many times, the imperative \r\nfor Security Council reform remains more real than \r\never before. We need to accelerate the pace of our work \r\naimed at achieving early and meaningful reforms. My \r\ndelegation will work with the President of the General \r\nAssembly as well as with the two new co-Chairs and \r\nother delegations to advance the reform agenda and \r\nmake the Security Council more open, accountable, \r\neffective, and inclusive.\r\nMs. Mejía Vélez (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for convening this meeting, \r\nwhich I consider to be of the utmost importance as it \r\naddresses one of the most controversial issues within \r\nthe Organization, namely, undertaking the reform of \r\nthe Security Council. Undoubtedly, as the President \r\nsaid this morning, this may very well be an opportunity \r\nfor all of us to finally to move towards a consensus \r\nthat would enable us to progress consistently within \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. I would like to \r\njoin my colleagues who spoke before me in thanking \r\nAmbassadors Ion Jinga of Romania and Mohamed \r\nKhiari of Tunisia for their successful and very \r\nconstructive work guiding the discussion process of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations during the previous \r\nsession. I also take this opportunity to welcome \r\nAmbassadors Kaha Imnadze of Georgia and Lana Zaki \r\nNusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates for taking the \r\nreins as the new co-Chairs.\r\nThe reform process is one that requires the entire \r\nmembership to continue moving forward in identifying \r\nthose points that bring us closer together in discussions, \r\nso that we can finally count on a Security Council that \r\nreflects the current geopolitical reality, its various \r\nnuances and the need for greater accountability and \r\ntransparency in the Council’s work. On behalf of my \r\ncountry and in aligning myself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Italy on behalf of the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group, I would like to highlight several \r\nelements that we consider to be of key importance for \r\nthe beginning of the current session.\r\nFirst, the moment is undoubtedly ripe for advancing \r\nthe process with new vigour, as the President said in his \r\nstatement this morning. To achieve that, it is important, \r\nin our view, to reiterate once again that — for the \r\nUniting for Consensus group — the fundamental \r\ndifference with respect to other proposals lies only in \r\nour firm conviction that a Council of more democratic \r\nand inclusive nature would result from the participation \r\nof a greater number of elected members. We would also \r\nseek to prevent the expansion of privileges such as the \r\nright of the veto.\r\nWe believe that, as the most representative \r\nOrganization at the global level, the United Nations must \r\nlead by example — which should be manifest particularly \r\nin the body that is fundamentally responsible for peace \r\nand international stability. Attaining that goal rests on \r\ntwo fundamental pillars: regional representation and \r\nthe accountability emanating from regular elections. In \r\nthat context, the document produced by the co-Chairs \r\nat the seventy-first session of the General Assembly \r\nmade it clear that all Member States, without exception, \r\nwish to reform the Security Council.\r\nWe understand that after the several decades \r\nsince the previous reform and the 10 years of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, the issue of expanding \r\nthe Council has assumed the utmost importance if we \r\nwish to improve the representation of the regions and \r\ngroups that are underrepresented, such as Africa and \r\nmy own region, Latin America and the Caribbean, \r\nto give just two examples — as was made clear in \r\nSierra Leone’s statement on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States.\r\nBy adopting the proposal of the Uniting for \r\nConsensus group, we could finally achieve a \r\nmembership size that is fair in relation to the weighting \r\nof issues on the Council’s agenda and geopolitical \r\nrepresentation. Inclusivity and democracy in the reform \r\nof the Council will not be achieved by perpetually \r\nextending the privileges of a few with regard to \r\npermanent membership and the right to veto, as has \r\nbeen reiterated by a number of delegations that have \r\nalready made their statements.\r\nOn the other hand and in line with the proposal of \r\nthe Uniting for Consensus group, we must insist that \r\na process of regular elections and fair geographical \r\nregional distribution is the way to ensure a strengthened \r\nSecurity Council. Furthermore, as explained by \r\nAmbassador Inigo Lambertini of Italy, longer \r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n22/29 17-36269\r\nmembership terms would strengthen the inclusive \r\nnature of the system, allowing the Council to become \r\na more representative, transparent and effective space, \r\nwith sufficient legitimacy for the permanent fulfilment \r\nand implementation of its mandates.\r\nFor Colombia, it is important to stress that \r\nexpanding the membership of the Security Council \r\nmust respect the principle of sovereign equality, as \r\nenshrined in Article 2 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. That is why it is our duty to work in such a way \r\nas to ensure that the United Nations is ready to face the \r\nchallenge of a world that demands that everyone play \r\nan active role in building a peaceful and increasingly \r\ninclusive society.\r\nMr. Kafle (Nepal): Nepal commends President \r\nLajčák’s initiative in holding this debate on the \r\nimportant agenda item of Security Council reform. I \r\ncongratulate the Permanent Representative of Georgia \r\nand the Permanent Representative of the United Arab \r\nEmirates on their being appointed co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process. My delegation \r\nbelieves that the negotiations process will soon resume \r\nunder their able leadership and dedication to steer it \r\nwith active and participatory consultations. I wish every \r\nsuccess to the co-Chairs and pledge my delegation’s \r\nfull cooperation. I would also like to compliment \r\nthe important leadership of the past co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nWe must acknowledge the unanimity among \r\nMember States on the urgent need to reform the Security \r\nCouncil. However, the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nhave become increasingly complex and slow moving, \r\nwith far too limited progress. The challenge ahead \r\nis to build on the progress made so far and exhibit \r\nthe political will to move forward. My delegation \r\ncommends the elements of convergence that have \r\nemerged on two key issues, namely, the relationship \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly and the \r\nsize of an enlarged Security Council and its working \r\nmethods. We must continue to build on that progress, \r\nwhile combining synergies and the strongest sense of \r\ncooperation for the next steps.\r\nWe live in a world that has undergone significant \r\nchanges. The global political landscape has changed \r\ndramatically, and the contours of the balance of power \r\nare being redefined. The United Nations has expanded \r\nfour-fold since its creation, while the Security Council \r\nhas experienced just one limited expansion. Reform \r\nis essential in order to ensure that the Council will be \r\nable to handle the challenges of the modern era and \r\nthe emerging realities. The current state of affairs is, \r\ntherefore, not an option, and Nepal calls for f lexibility \r\nfrom Member States to reach convergence on other \r\nremaining clusters so that we can move forward in the \r\nreform process.\r\nNepal has been a long-standing partner in United \r\nNations peacekeeping and civilian protection around \r\nthe world and is honoured to have served twice so far \r\nin the Council. As far as Security Council reform is \r\nconcerned, Nepal does not belong to any group and \r\nfrom its national perspective merely wishes to reiterate \r\na number of points. The expansion of the number of both \r\npermanent and non-permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil must reflect the contemporary geopolitical \r\nreality. In short, Nepal underscores the need for greater \r\nrepresentation in the Council for Asia, Africa, Latin \r\nAmerica and other regional groups. The expansion of \r\nthe permanent member category should correct that \r\nhistorical error and ensure the representation of Africa, \r\namong others.\r\nLikewise, it is essential to ensure the equitable \r\nrepresentation of developing countries. In that \r\nconnection, Nepal understands the merit of the \r\naspirations of the Group of Four to join the Council \r\nas permanent members. Nepal believes in the fair \r\nand judicious principle of rotation on a regional and \r\nsubregional basis. In particular, the contribution to \r\ninternational peace and security should be given due \r\nrecognition during nomination and election, especially \r\nwhen the contributing countries are relatively small \r\nand face special situations, such as the landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries or countries emerging from \r\nconflict. In fact, the landlocked developing countries \r\nshould be represented as a special constituency \r\nin the Council, based on their special permanent \r\nfeature of a geographical hardship with serious \r\nsecurity implications.\r\nNepal supports the total elimination of the right \r\nto veto, in conformity with the principle of sovereign \r\nequality. Nevertheless, until we reach the state of the \r\nabsolute abolition of the right to veto, Nepal supports \r\nexercising restraint on the use of the veto. There \r\nshould be no new tier of members introduced, such as \r\npermanent members with or without veto. The expansion \r\nof membership should ensure equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation and should enhance inclusiveness in the \r\ndecision-making process of the Security Council. Any \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 23/29\r\nenlargement of the Security Council should take into \r\naccount the concerns of the smaller countries.\r\nThe Council should neither be so big that its \r\nefficiency is seriously compromised, nor so small that \r\nit fails to be representative. Therefore, the size of the \r\nSecurity Council should be expanded to 24, ensuring \r\nthat each non-permanent member of the Council \r\ncan hold the presidency at least once during its two-\r\nyear term. The intergovernmental negotiations are a \r\nMember State-driven process. We stress the need for \r\na democratic, representative, transparent, inclusive, \r\neffective, efficient and accountable process to make \r\nthe Council fit for purpose in fulfilling the mandate of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nNepal affirms that the Council should not encroach \r\non the authority and work of the General Assembly \r\nand other organs. While we welcome the increased \r\nexchange of information between the Presidents of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, we would \r\nalso like to see an enhanced level of coordination and \r\nconsultation between the two bodies so as to maintain \r\naccountability, transparency and coherence in the work \r\nof the Council.\r\nIn order to enhance transparency there should \r\nbe more briefings and information-sharing for \r\nnon-members about the decisions of the Council. While \r\nwelcoming the Council’s open meetings, which enable \r\nnon-members to be heard, the Council should also seek \r\nto ensure that all important ideas are taken on board \r\nin the decision-making process. In conclusion, only \r\nthe strong political will and f lexibility for convergence \r\namong Member States with regard to the much-needed \r\nSecurity Council reform will contribute to enabling the \r\nCouncil to fulfil its goal of maintaining international \r\npeace and security and creating a peaceful world. \r\nSooner rather than later, all Member States should kick-\r\nstart their efforts in that direction.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): Pakistan aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by Italy on behalf of the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group. My delegation also congratulates \r\nthe Ambassadors of the United Arab Emirates and \r\nGeorgia on their appointment as co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process. We assure \r\nthem of our full support in moving this process forward.\r\nOver the years, we have become accustomed \r\nto hearing a litany of complaints from a handful of \r\ndelegations about the slow pace of reform. They argue \r\nthat the intergovernmental negotiations process has \r\nbecome a means to perpetuate the status quo, rather \r\nthan a vehicle of change; and that in time the process \r\nhas become an end in itself.\r\nTaken at face value, that view has merit, but we \r\ncannot but marvel at those delegations for liberally \r\nblaming others when the responsibility for the impasse \r\nlies squarely on them. These countries seek a privileged \r\nand unequal status for themselves, anchored in \r\npower politics, which is in sharp contradiction to the \r\ndemocratic spirit of our times. Even more telling, while \r\nthey remain firmly wedded to their positions, they ask \r\nothers to be f lexible. It is equally disingenuous for them \r\nto invoke the majority principle in seeking membership \r\nof the Council, when they deny the same principle to \r\nthe larger membership of the United Nations when \r\nthey are being held to account. It is not a lack of will \r\non the part of the many, but a lack of will on the part \r\nof a few that remains the most persistent stumbling \r\nblock in the way of achieving a more representative, \r\ntransparent, accountable and effective reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nDecision 62/557 lays the overarching framework \r\nand mandate for intergovernmental negotiations — a \r\nmembership-driven process with the aim of achieving \r\ncomprehensive reform on the five equally important and \r\ninterlinked issues, which are to be facilitated in good \r\nfaith, with mutual respect and in an open, inclusive and \r\ntransparent manner, with the objective of achieving the \r\nwidest possible political acceptance on the part of the \r\nmembership. Those are not just noble aspirations, but \r\nagreed parameters for reform.\r\nYet what we have seen, unfortunately, is the repeated \r\ntendency by some to sidestep consensus through quick \r\nfixes and procedural manoeuvres. Such attempts not \r\nonly turn the process into a majority-minority calculus \r\nand undermine mutual trust, but they also betray a lack \r\nof common understanding over the fundamentals of the \r\nissue. Seeking to introduce a text into such a chasm will \r\nnot bridge our differences, it will accentuate them. We \r\nwould be better served by not chasing such a chimera. \r\nWhat is required is not to set artificial deadlines, but \r\ninstead, to heed the call for f lexibility and readiness \r\nto find common ground. The Uniting for Consensus \r\ngroup has lived by that ideal, calibrating its position \r\nto reflect the interests and aspirations of all Member \r\nStates — small, medium-sized and large. It is time for \r\nothers to show the same spirit of compromise and the \r\nsame spirit of f lexibility.\r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n24/29 17-36269\r\nPakistan’s views on Security Council reform are well \r\nknown. We are firmly opposed to the creation of new \r\npermanent seats, as they are contrary to the universally \r\nagreed principles of democracy, accountability and \r\ntransparency. After all, permanent membership remains \r\nat the core of much that is f lawed about the existing \r\nSecurity Council. It is therefore counter-intuitive, in \r\nour view, to advocate an expansion in the Council as a \r\nmeans to address its inherent dysfunctionalities. That \r\ncould, at best, be a measure to promote the self-serving \r\ninterests of a few who deride the permanent membership \r\nas an anachronism, yet stand ready to embrace it in the \r\nsame breath. It cannot become the rationale for a well-\r\nmeaning and comprehensive reform effort. An enlarged \r\npermanent membership of the Security Council would \r\nalso compromise its efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nAt a time when growing and complex challenges \r\nto global peace and security warrant firm and clear \r\naction by the Security Council, an enlarged permanent \r\nmembership, operating on the basis of the least \r\ncommon denominator, would erode the standing of \r\nthe Council and not strengthen its role, as some would \r\nhave us believe. On the other hand, expansion in the \r\nnon-permanent category of membership, based on \r\nequitable geographic distribution and a system of fair \r\nrotation, a solution that my country favours, is both \r\nfair and just and is supported by all Member States \r\nand groups. That should serve as a natural point of \r\ndeparture for any reform of the Security Council.\r\nIt also speaks to the imperative of reflecting \r\ncontemporary realities. As contemporary realities \r\nare tied to the present, how can a permanent status \r\nbe bestowed upon a transitory, impermanent state. \r\nThat inconsistency can be answered only by longer-\r\nterm non-permanent seats with possible re-election. \r\nSimilarly, an expansion in the non-permanent category \r\nwill foster a wider and fairer rotation within regional \r\ngroups. What is needed are seats for the regions, not \r\nseats merely claimed on their behalf.\r\nOn the issue of regional representation, we fully \r\nrespect the Common African Position, which voices \r\nthe demand of an entire continent, as being inherently \r\ndifferent from the demand for permanent seats in \r\npursuit of narrow national ambitions.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reaffirm that Pakistan remains \r\nsteadfast in its commitment to comprehensive reform \r\nof the Security Council. Anything less would be a \r\ngreat disservice to the United Nations and the inspiring \r\nvision that it espouses for all our collective humankind.\r\nMr. Jürgenson (Estonia): At the outset, allow me \r\nto thank the President for convening today’s debate on \r\nthis crucial topic. We are all convinced that the United \r\nNations has to be fit for purpose and that Security \r\nCouncil reform should help to make the United Nations \r\nmore credible and stronger. The Security Council \r\nneeds to have the capacity and readiness to adequately \r\nrespond to all the challenges in the world and live \r\nup to its primary responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. But that has not, \r\nunfortunately, always been the case.\r\nBefore turning to some elements most important \r\nto Estonia regarding the reform, I would like to thank \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Romania and Tunisia \r\nfor their hard work leading the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations in the previous session and wish the very \r\nbest for the Permanent Representatives of Georgia and \r\nUnited Arab Emirates in their endeavours during the \r\nseventy-second session.\r\nNow, let me highlight the most important issues \r\nfor Estonia in the Security Council reform process. We \r\nhave had to witness, on numerous occasions, how some \r\nmembers of the Council have used or threatened to use \r\nthe veto, leaving the Council paralysed and unable to \r\nreact to situations where action is needed the most. \r\nEstonia has expressed before and continues to highlight \r\nits position that permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil should voluntarily and collectively commit \r\nthemselves not to use their veto to block Council action \r\naimed at preventing or ending situations involving \r\nmass atrocity crimes.\r\nAs a member of the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency group, Estonia also supports the group’s \r\ncode of conduct calling for all members of the Council \r\nnot to vote against credible Security Council resolutions \r\nthat are aimed at preventing or ending genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and war crimes. We welcome the \r\nwide support expressed by 114 Member States for the \r\ncode of conduct. Hopefully, more countries will be \r\nlending their support to the code in the near future. \r\nEstonia has also reiterated its support for the initiative \r\nby France and Mexico on the use of the veto. We believe \r\nthat those two initiatives are complementary and share \r\na common goal.\r\nLet me also highlight another issue important \r\nto Estonia regarding the expansion of the Security \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 25/29\r\nCouncil. The United Nations must adapt to the realities \r\nof current times. Estonia believes that every country, \r\nsmall or big, should have the opportunity to be \r\nrepresented in the Council, but it is absolutely vital that \r\nsmall nations have a stronger voice.\r\nFinally, let me emphasize that small steps in \r\nimproving the working methods of the Security Council \r\ncan bring about a positive effect with much wider \r\nreach. Estonia would like to see greater accountability, \r\ncoherence and transparency of the Council’s activities \r\nthrough increased inclusiveness and targeted action. \r\nThese principles are key in governing our State. We \r\nconsciously apply them, as we believe they will make \r\nour governance more effective and easier to understand \r\nby people. We believe that the same principles would \r\nhave an even greater effect at the regional or global \r\nlevel and therefore should be embraced and used by \r\ndifferent international organizations, including the \r\nUnited Nations. As a body representing all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, the Security Council \r\ncould also benefit from these principles.\r\nWe also need better communication between \r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly. The \r\nSecurity Council should be kept accountable by all \r\nMember States by ensuring more transparency in its \r\nactions and more cohesiveness in resolutions and \r\ndecisions. It is a shortcoming of the Council that its rules \r\nof procedure are still provisional. It is very much up to \r\nCouncil members to make use of existing procedures \r\nand the Council’s different outreach formats to achieve \r\na better outcome for their work.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm Estonia’s \r\ncommitment to engaging constructively in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the seventy-\r\nsecond session to continue moving the reform \r\nprocess forward.\r\nMr. Hahn Choonghee (Republic of Korea): I thank \r\nthe President for his initiative in convening this annual \r\ndebate on Security Council reform. I also extend a warm \r\nwelcome to the co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, Ambassador Nusseibeh of the United \r\nArab Emirates and Ambassador Imnadze of Georgia. \r\nI have every confidence in their ability and leadership. \r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nAmbassador Jinga of Romania and Ambassador Khiari \r\nof Tunisia for their contributions as co-Chairs last year.\r\nAt the outset, the Republic of Korea aligns itself \r\nwith the statement made by the representative of Italy \r\non behalf of the Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group.\r\nWe all have agreed on the imperative of reforming \r\nthe Security Council, and the reason why we have been \r\npursuing this agenda is quite clear. Facing the complex \r\nchallenges of today, we are now feeling an increased \r\nsense of urgency to transform the Security Council \r\ninto a more effective entity that is better able to fulfil \r\nits primary responsibility of maintaining international \r\npeace and security.\r\nHowever, we have unfortunately not seen any \r\nmeaningful progress since we started our discussions \r\nmore than 25 years ago. But make no mistake: the \r\nlack of progress, I believe, is not due to our inaction \r\nor a weak sense of urgency. If anything, this situation \r\nreflects the degree of sensitivity and gravity required \r\nin this discussion, which will lead to a sea change \r\nin the international geostrategic landscape and the \r\narchitecture of global governance and will eventually \r\naffect all people around the world. In this regard, let us \r\nremind ourselves that it is high time to think about the \r\nbasics and purposes of our discussion and to redouble \r\nour efforts aimed at working together.\r\nWhen we pursue the reform of the Council, I \r\nbelieve that the most important factors are, first, the \r\nprinciples of the reform; secondly, the process of our \r\ndeliberations; and, thirdly, the actual outcomes. With \r\nrespect to these three underlying factors, the Republic \r\nof Korea has very clear positions and views.\r\nFirst and foremost, we have repeatedly \r\nsuggested that the reform must be based on clear \r\nprinciples, namely, a democratic underpinning, \r\nrepresentativeness, transparency, accountability and \r\neffectiveness. I am pleased to see that, over the most \r\nrecent intergovernmental negotiations meetings, we \r\nhave been narrowing, rather than widening, the gaps \r\nof our understanding on these principles. Without any \r\nhesitation, Korea firmly believes that the UfC position, \r\nwhich is highlighted by a new category of long-term \r\nre-electable seat, is the best fit for all our principles, \r\nsuch as being democratic, representative, accountable \r\nand effective.\r\nSecondly, our entire deliberative process should \r\nbe, as decision 62/557 articulates, aimed at seeking a \r\nsolution that can garner the widest possible political \r\nacceptance by Member States. However, there must \r\nbe more to the phrase “the widest possible political \r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n26/29 17-36269\r\nacceptance” than just a number. Indeed, a spirit of \r\nworking together towards a more expanded and robust \r\nconsensus will be needed, particularly in an agenda as \r\ncomplicated as this one. At this moment, I believe that \r\nthere is still a fundamental and philosophical difference \r\nof views between the expansion of permanent seats and \r\nthe expansion of non-permanent seats with longer-term \r\nrenewable terms.\r\nThirdly, Security Council reform is urgent, but the \r\nreform should be right and just. It must also be sustainable. \r\nConsidering that the dynamics of international politics \r\nhave been, and will constantly be, in a state of f lux, it is \r\nof paramount importance to come up with a sustainable \r\nand democratic mechanism in the Council that works \r\nin the long term. Through such a mechanism, aspirant \r\ncountries, including African States, should be given \r\nappropriate opportunities — now and in the future — to \r\nplay an enlarged role in the Council.\r\nI am confident that only through the creation of \r\nthe longer-term re-electable seat could any country \r\napply for this seat at any time — now or in future, \r\nwhen that country feels that it is ready to do so. This \r\nprocess, based on the election of a candidate, will \r\nensure open competition and equal opportunity for all \r\nMember States.\r\nTo achieve our vision for a principled, sustainable \r\nand most widely acceptable reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, the Republic of Korea, along with other \r\nmembers of the Uniting for Consensus group, has \r\nproposed to establish a new category of longer-term \r\nre-electable non-permanent seats. Our suggestion \r\nis based on the clear conviction that reform cannot \r\nbe accomplished by just following the concepts of \r\npermanency and veto, which was a system reflecting \r\nthe unique situation and context after the Second World \r\nWar. Further, a merely enlarged version of the current \r\nCouncil will eventually exacerbate the very problems \r\nthat vex us today rather than solve them. Instead, we \r\nbelieve that increasing the number of democratically \r\nelected non-permanent seats, including longer-term \r\nseats, will alone offer a clear way forward. Moreover, it \r\nwill avoid the problems of the veto altogether.\r\nThe permanency of seats and the veto represent a \r\nsingle issue — two sides of the same coin. Therefore, if \r\nwe consider expanding the number of permanent seats, \r\nwe will get entangled with the veto issue because the \r\nveto is inextricably linked to the concept of permanency; \r\nthe problem lies in its very nature.\r\nThe Republic of Korea sincerely hopes that the \r\nseventy-second session of the General Assembly \r\nand the coming intergovernmental negotiations will \r\nproduce tangible results as we strive to achieve the long-\r\noverdue reform of the Council. I assure the General \r\nAssembly that the Republic of Korea stands ready to \r\nconstructively work with others to formulate a solution \r\nthat can garner the support and understanding of the \r\nentire membership, and one that the general public and \r\nthe people of the international community can fully \r\nbelieve in and welcome.\r\nMr. Cortorreal (Dominican Republic) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): First of all, I appreciate the convening of \r\nthis meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\nrelated matters. We welcome the appointment of our \r\ncolleagues Ambassador Nusseibeh of the United Arab \r\nEmirates and Ambassador Imnadze of Georgia to \r\nco-chair the intergovernmental negotiations on this \r\nissue. We also thank Ambassador Jinga of Romania \r\nand Ambassador Khiari of Tunisia for their efforts in \r\ncontinuing to find points of convergence on the subject \r\nof Security Council reform.\r\nSince the creation of the United Nations, the world \r\nhas changed. The Security Council finds it increasingly \r\ndifficult to prevent conflicts, consolidate peace and \r\nstop atrocities. In this context, Security Council \r\nreform becomes increasingly critical. We believe that \r\nsuch reform would guarantee the sustainability of the \r\ncommunity of nations and global causes. We believe \r\nthat the Security Council must live up to the demands \r\nof today’s world and that of the future.\r\nThe Dominican Republic has been endorsed by the \r\nGroup of Latin American and Caribbean States to take \r\na non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the \r\nperiod 2019-2020, in the elections to be held in June \r\n2018. If we receive the mandate from the members of \r\nthe General Assembly, our main objective will be to \r\nredouble our efforts aimed at revitalizing the role of \r\nthe Security Council, thereby enabling this important \r\norgan to face the new challenges that currently exist for \r\nsmall island developing States, such as climate change, \r\nenvironmental degradation and the increased frequency \r\nof natural disasters.\r\nI would like to briefly recapitulate our position on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We reiterate our support for \r\nthe expansion of both categories of seats — permanent \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 27/29\r\nand non-permanent — in the Council. In this regard, \r\nwe call for an improved representation of Africa, Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean and other regions, thereby \r\nlending due consideration to the adequate representation \r\nof the small and medium-sized Member States, which \r\naccount for the vast majority of the membership of the \r\nUnited Nations. Likewise, we consider it necessary to \r\nreform the working methods of the Security Council \r\nwith a view to increasing transparency and efficiency. \r\nWe support the commitment to carrying out negotiations \r\non the basis of decision 62/557, which the General \r\nAssembly adopted in September 2008.\r\nWe already have a fairly comprehensive historical \r\nrecord of the progress made during this cycle of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, in particular the \r\nframework document prepared by the Ambassador of \r\nJamaica in 2015, as well as the important contribution \r\nrecorded in the last two sessions. We believe that, \r\nto achieve concrete results in and due respect for \r\nnegotiation processes in the United Nations, political \r\nwill is required.\r\nFinally, the Dominican Republic would like to \r\nreiterate its willingness and commitment to continuing \r\nto constructively participate in all initiatives \r\nundertaken with the objective of creating a Security \r\nCouncil that reflects the diversity of the United Nations \r\nmembership, which calls for the broadest f lexibility \r\nin negotiations. We believe that such steps would \r\nincrease the legitimacy, transparency and inclusiveness \r\nof the Organization. The role played by the General \r\nAssembly in the process of selecting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral demonstrated that all Member States can and \r\nmust contribute to strengthening the work of the United \r\nNations, thus updating and expanding the democratic \r\ncharacter of global governance.\r\nMr. Mlynár (Slovakia): I thank the President for \r\nconvening this important plenary meeting and inviting \r\nus to speak. My delegation appreciates the fact that \r\nthe President has decided to advance Security Council \r\nreform as one of his priorities for the seventy-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly and for his leadership \r\non this important issue.\r\nInternational cooperation, understanding and \r\ngenuine dialogue are increasingly necessary if we are \r\nto meet contemporary global challenges. A United \r\nNations system that is fit for purpose is needed to \r\nsupport this cooperation. All Member States seem to \r\nagree in principle on the fundamental idea of reforming \r\nthe United Nations in order to make it stronger and more \r\nresponsive to the people it serves. Security Council \r\nreform is an essential part of the comprehensive reform \r\nof the United Nations, and Slovakia continues to be \r\ncommitted to finding a favourable outcome in terms of \r\nCouncil reform so as to make the organ more broadly \r\nrepresentative, efficient and transparent.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Kaha Imnadze, Permanent Representative \r\nof Georgia, and Ambassador Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, \r\nPermanent Representative of the United Arab Emirates, \r\non their respective appointments as co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. I would like to assure \r\nthem of my delegation’s full support and cooperation \r\nin the forthcoming negotiations. We would also like \r\nto express our sincere appreciation to the former \r\nco-Chairs, Ambassador Jinga and Ambassador Khiari, \r\nfor their dedication and hard work.\r\nWe welcome the intensified efforts undertaken \r\nduring previous General Assembly sessions to bridge \r\nproposals and identify ways to move the work forward. \r\nWe should continue and accelerate the process of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations based on the results \r\nreached by the end of the sixty-ninth, seventieth and \r\nseventy-first sessions. I should like to note that my \r\ndelegation joins other countries in calling for the start \r\nof text-based negotiations on Security Council reform \r\nthat would give the intergovernmental negotiations a \r\nsubstantive meaning and take us to the next stage in \r\nthis important process.\r\nThe position of my delegation on the possible \r\nreview of the membership of the Security Council is \r\nconsistent and well documented. Slovakia supports the \r\nexpansion of membership in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories and calls for an increase to \r\nno more than 25, representing geographical balance. \r\nThe new members of the Council should, as a principle, \r\nhave the same responsibilities and obligations as the \r\ncurrent ones. I wish to underscore that a reformed \r\nCouncil should include one additional non-permanent \r\nseat for the Group of Eastern European States.\r\nWe welcome the developments in the direction \r\nof enhancing the Council’s working methods. We \r\nhope that further improvements can be achieved on \r\nissues such as peacekeeping, conflict prevention, \r\npeacebuilding and peace enforcement. Similarly, \r\nwe welcome positive movements towards improving \r\nthe Council’s relationship with other United Nations \r\nA/72/PV.41 07/11/2017\r\n28/29 17-36269\r\norgans, such as the General Assembly, the Secretariat \r\nand the Peacebuilding Commission, inter alia, as well \r\nas regional and subregional organizations, especially \r\nthe African Union, the European Union and others. \r\nThese efforts should continue.\r\nThe five key reform issues set forth in decision \r\n62/557 remain the guiding principles of our work in \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. While divergent \r\nopinions remain about all five issues, we should \r\nexplore them again in greater detail, giving special \r\nconsideration to the following: first, how best to address \r\nthe wide political acceptance of the common African \r\nposition; secondly, how best to reflect the changing \r\nglobal reality in an updated Security Council; thirdly, \r\nhow to effectively translate the universal agreement \r\non the expansion of the two-year non-permanent-\r\nmember category into practice, given that more than \r\n60 States Members of the United Nations have never \r\nbeen members of the Security Council to date; and \r\nfourthly, how we can all move together to the next stage \r\nof negotiations.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation looks forward to \r\nengaging in open, transparent, inclusive and results-\r\noriented negotiations, with a view to moving the \r\nprocess forward during the seventy-second session of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I thank the President for having organized \r\nthis meeting. I wish to take this opportunity to thank \r\nAmbassadors Jinga of Romania and Khiari of Tunisia for \r\ntheir skilful work as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations at the previous session of the General \r\nAssembly. I also wish to congratulate Ambassador \r\nImnadze of Georgia and Ambassador Nusseibeh of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates for their respective appointments \r\nas co-Chairs for this session. They can count on the full \r\nsupport and cooperation of my delegation in working \r\nconstructively on the issue that we are being asked \r\nto consider.\r\nArgentina endorses the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Italy on behalf of the Uniting for \r\nConsensus group. Nevertheless, I wish to make a \r\nnumber of points.\r\n Once again, today we are tackling the work before \r\nus aware of the need to be f lexible and find agreement. \r\nWe are profoundly committed to multilateralism \r\nbecause such a commitment is the only guarantee of \r\nsuccess. Argentina trusts that all delegations will \r\ndemonstrate similar f lexibility because only through \r\nmultilateralism, based on concrete actions and leadership \r\ncapability, will they be able to uphold the interests of all \r\nnations and bring about a Security Council that is more \r\ndemocratic, truly inclusive and efficient, and which \r\ncould adequately fulfil the responsibilities assigned to \r\nit by the Charter of the United Nations.\r\n Argentina was dismayed by the outcome of the \r\nlast  round of intergovernmental negotiations because \r\nwe saw a group of countries stating that there was no \r\nagreement on the principle of democracy as a principal \r\nguide in the reform of the Council. The principle of \r\naccountability is crucial to ensure a more effective and \r\nefficient Security Council, which is an objective that, to \r\ndate, has not met with disagreement.\r\nIf the Security Council is to be more effective and \r\nefficient, we need to enhance the transparency of its \r\nactions and strengthen its democratic representativeness. \r\nArgentina is therefore convinced that during the next \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process there needs \r\nto be an interest in achieving a more broad political \r\nagreement on Security Council reform and that issues \r\nof principle need to be addressed without delay, leading \r\nto agreements on such fundamental principles as \r\nequitable representation and membership categories, \r\ninter alia.\r\n Based on our experience from this long process of \r\nnegotiation, Argentina continues to be ready and willing \r\nto find innovative and robust ways that will ensure a \r\nmore democratic representation on the Security Council, \r\nimprove the prospects of non-permanent members and \r\nreform the working methods of the Council, making it \r\nmore transparent, interactive and inclusive. The Charter \r\nstates that in order to ensure rapid and effective action \r\non the part of the United Nations, its Members entrusted \r\nthe Security Council with the primary responsibility \r\nof maintaining international peace and security. \r\nIt also recognizes that the Security Council acts \r\non behalf of Members in discharging the functions \r\nimposed by this responsibility.\r\nThe victors of the Second World War assumed \r\nthat responsibility on a permanent basis, but any State \r\nthat sees peace as a key element of its development \r\nwould must actively assume that responsibility as \r\nwell. Argentina therefore supports only an increase \r\nin the non-permanent-member category, because \r\npermanency is intrinsically antagonistic to the notion \r\nof representativeness in a democratic context in which \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.41\r\n17-36269 29/29\r\nthe will of the represented legitimizes and periodically \r\ninforms such representativeness. It is well known that \r\nany legitimate and representative democratic system \r\nworthy of the name is underpinned by the fundamental \r\nelement of elections. Moreover, Argentina believes \r\nthat including new permanent members on the Council \r\nwould not ensure greater participation of the members \r\nthat today are not represented therein and considers the \r\nidea of expanding the permanent-member category in \r\nthe context of today’s extremely complex and evolving \r\ninternational reality to be unpromising.\r\n Since the Organization’s very inception, the \r\nArgentine Republic has explicitly defended the \r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States. Against \r\nthe backdrop of Security Council reform, this \r\nprinciple will be upheld only if we create conditions \r\nin which every Member State has a chance to serve \r\nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council, \r\ngiving greater prominence to regional representation \r\nby adjusting the relative proportions of regional group \r\nto bring about more equitable representation. The \r\nproposal of the Uniting for Consensus group takes \r\nthis concern into account and is the only proposal of \r\ncommitment presented in recent years to address in a \r\nbalanced and fair manner the aspirations of the different \r\ngroups that have participated in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation process.\r\nImproving the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil is of the utmost relevance for Argentina. We \r\nhave taken every opportunity to encourage the Council \r\nto work in a transparent and open fashion and be \r\naccountable for all its actions before the Organization \r\nas a whole.\r\n In conclusion, Argentina reiterates and reaffirms \r\nits willingness to continue working with an open mind \r\non all proposals which, respecting the principles granted \r\nby the General Assembly, would bring positions closer \r\nwith a view to implement the necessary democratic \r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker for this morning’s meeting on \r\nthis matter. I wish to thank the interpretation service \r\nfor its commitment and patience.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Before \r\nclosing this meeting, I wish to remind members that the \r\nconsideration of agenda item 73, entitled “Strengthening \r\nof the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance of the United Nations, including special \r\neconomic assistance” (including sub-items (a), (b) and \r\n(c)), which was to take place in a meeting scheduled \r\nto take place on Thursday, 7 December, has been \r\npostponed to Friday, 8 December at 3 p.m.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
