" \r\nUnited Nations A/72/PV.42\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n42nd plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 7 November 2017, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Hilale \r\n(Morocco), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 122 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand other matters related to the Security Council\r\nMr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ncountry aligns itself with the statements delivered by the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Sierra Leone and Kuwait \r\non behalf of the Group of African States and the Group \r\nof Arab States, respectively (see A/72/PV.41). I would \r\nlike to add the following points in my national capacity.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the President \r\nfor convening today’s plenary meeting on the question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and other related \r\nmatters, as well as for the importance he has attached \r\nto expanding and reforming the Security Council, as \r\nconfirmed in his remarks at the opening of this year’s \r\ngeneral debate (see A/72/PV.3).\r\nI would like to commend the efforts of the various \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nespecially Mr. Ion Jinga, Permanent Representative \r\nof Romania, and Mr. Mohamed Khaled Khiari, \r\nPermanent Representative of Tunisia, who co-chaired \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations during the seventy-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly. I would also like \r\nto welcome the appointment of our two colleagues, \r\nMr. Kaha Imnadze, Permanent Representative of \r\nGeorgia, and Mrs. Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Arab Emirates, as the \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations during \r\nthe current session, which shows that the President \r\nis aware of the need to strengthen Member States’ \r\nconfidence in the negotiations process with a view to \r\nbuilding the widest possible consensus.\r\nEgypt is fully aware of the need for a real and \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council as part \r\nand parcel of reforming the United Nations system so as \r\nto promote the purposes and principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and allow the Organization to \r\naddress new and emerging international challenges. \r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations should continue \r\nin a transparent and inclusive manner and be Member-\r\ndriven in order to reach an agreed solution that would \r\ngarner the widest possible political acceptance. These \r\nnegotiations should focus on the five interrelated issues \r\nset forth in decision 62/557. We hope that these aspects \r\nwill guide the work of the new co-Chairs during the \r\ncurrent negotiations.\r\nOver the past two years, Egypt has been honoured \r\nto serve on the Security Council as one of the three \r\nelected African members and as the only Arab \r\nmember of the Council. The experiences that we have \r\naccumulated during this period have strengthened a \r\nnumber of our long-standing beliefs. As our term on the \r\nCouncil nears its end, I would like to recall a number \r\nof these beliefs, as they might contribute to success \r\nin our common efforts, within the framework of the \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n17-37015 (E)\r\n*1737015*\r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n2/29 17-37015\r\nintergovernmental negotiations, aimed at ensuring a \r\nreal and comprehensive reform of the Security Council.\r\nOne of our beliefs is that there can be no real \r\nreform of the Security Council without addressing the \r\ndysfunction within the Council, namely, the hegemony \r\nthat permanent members wield over the work of the \r\nCouncil through their monopoly of the right to veto. \r\nThis situation underlines the relevance of the Common \r\nAfrican Position, which gives voice to the principle \r\nthat the right to veto should be eliminated. Until the \r\nveto right is eliminated, however, all new permanent \r\nmembers of the Council should be granted the same \r\nprerogatives and privileges as the original permanent \r\nmembers so as to ensure fair representation, which is \r\none of the main goals of the reform process.\r\nIn the same vein, we reject any piecemeal approach \r\nthat would focus only on increasing the number of \r\nnon-permanent seats or the number of categories of \r\npermanent seats without addressing the right to veto in \r\na manner that would ensure the equal treatment of all \r\npermanent members, whether they be current or future \r\nmembers. Such a piecemeal approach will not lead to a \r\nreal and fair reform of the Security Council; rather, it \r\nwould exacerbate the current imbalances from which \r\nthe Council suffers.\r\nEgypt is fully committed to the Common African \r\nPosition, as set forth in the Ezulwini Consensus and the \r\nSirte Declaration, which is the only position reaffirmed \r\nin numerous African summits. This position provides \r\nfor a comprehensive vision for reforming the Security \r\nCouncil, including eliminating the veto right. The \r\ngrowing support for the Common African Position \r\nproves that an increasing number of Member States \r\nare aware of the need to address the historic injustices \r\nperpetrated against the African continent, which \r\ncontinues to be underrepresented in both the permanent \r\nand non-permanent categories. The African continent \r\nshould be allowed to contribute to the work of the \r\nCouncil, particularly with respect to agenda items \r\npertaining to Africa. That is especially true given that \r\nthe Council frequently addresses Africa-related items \r\non its agenda.\r\nIn closing, after many attempts throughout past \r\nsessions to produce documents and papers, I hope that \r\nefforts during the current session will be focused on \r\nbuilding a common will to make real progress and build \r\nconsensus among different countries and groups with \r\na view to reaching an acceptable solution. We stress \r\nthe need to reach a consensus on the principles and \r\nstandards of reform as an important step in this regard \r\nand in a way that would strengthen Member States’ \r\nconfidence in the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nEgypt stands ready to cooperate with all Member States \r\nso as to ensure comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil in a manner that would allow the Council to \r\ncarry out its effective role in maintaining international \r\npeace and security.\r\nMr. Lapouge (France) (spoke in French): First \r\nof all, I would like to commend the appointment of \r\nAmbassadors Lana Zaki Nusseibeh and Kaha Imnadze \r\nas co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We know that we can count \r\non their dynamism and their resolve, as well as on their \r\nability to bring the views of delegations together in \r\nthe framework of constructive dialogue. France will \r\nprovide them with its full support so as to ensure the \r\nsuccess of their mission.\r\nThe discussions on Security Council reform \r\nwithin the General Assembly have been going on for \r\nalmost two decades, and we are still far from reaching \r\na successful conclusion. The process is long, difficult \r\nand frustrating in many ways. Nonetheless, even if the \r\nprogress made can legitimately be seen as insufficient \r\nin the eyes of many delegations, including my own, such \r\nprogress still exists. It is therefore necessary to build on \r\nthese achievements during the seventy-second session.\r\nUnder the leadership of Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, the work carried out at the sixty-ninth session \r\nof the General Assembly resulted in an initial concrete \r\noutcome with the drafting of a framework document \r\nlikely to act as a basis for global negotiations. This \r\ndocument has received the support and contributions \r\nof a large majority of Member States. The subsequent \r\nwork carried out during the seventieth session, under \r\nthe leadership of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, made it \r\npossible to identify elements of convergence on two \r\nkey points of the reform. This year, in work conducted \r\nat the seventy-first session led by Ambassadors Khaled \r\nKhiari and Ion Jinga, revealed common ground on \r\ncertain elements of the reform.\r\nFrance hopes that the result of all this work will \r\nserve as a basis for the cycle of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations that is beginning in this session in order to \r\nachieve decisive progress. Such progress is necessary, \r\nas the Secretary-General has embarked on the ambitious \r\nprocess of reforming our Organization with regard \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 3/29\r\nto the pillars of peace and security, development and \r\nthe management of the United Nations. The General \r\nAssembly must show an equally resolute commitment \r\nto reforming the Security Council.\r\nIn order to achieve this decisive progress, my \r\ndelegation believes — as do a very large majority of \r\ndelegations, especially those in the Group of Friends \r\non Security Council Reform — that it is now necessary \r\nto begin negotiating a text as soon as possible. We \r\nare counting on the new co-Chairs to work in this \r\ndirection. This reform is indeed crucial: the Security \r\nCouncil must better reflect the realities of today’s world \r\nwhile preserving its executive and decision-making \r\ncharacter, thereby bolstering its ability to fully shoulder \r\nits responsibilities in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.\r\nFrance’s position is unwavering and well known in \r\nthat respect. We hope that the Council will take into \r\naccount the emergence of new Powers that are willing \r\nand able to assume responsibility for a permanent \r\npresence in the Security Council and, in accordance \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations, are able to make \r\nan important contribution to the work of the Council. \r\nTo this end, France supports the candidacy of Germany, \r\nBrazil, India and Japan as permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council, as well as a strengthened \r\npresence of African countries among permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members.\r\nAs President Emmanuel Macron stated in his \r\naddress to the General Assembly in September (see \r\nA/72/PV.4), we need a Security Council that can make \r\nappropriate and efficient decisions, without being \r\nhindered by the exercise of the veto when mass atrocities \r\nare being committed. It is in this spirit that, since 2013, \r\nFrance has proposed that the five permanent members \r\nof the Council voluntarily and collectively commit \r\nthemselves not to resort to the veto in the event of mass \r\natrocities. This voluntary approach does not require \r\na revision of the Charter but a political commitment. \r\nFrance voiced this position through the President of the \r\nRepublic from this rostrum in 2015 (see A/70/PV.13).\r\nToday, the initiative that we put forward jointly \r\nwith Mexico is supported by nearly 100 countries. In \r\nthe same spirit, the code of conduct developed by the \r\nAccountability, Coherence and Transparency group, \r\nwhich France supports, has also received widespread \r\nsupport. Based on this dynamic, we hope that we will \r\nbe able to convince other Member States to join us in \r\nthis endeavour. It is indeed in the common interest of \r\nall Member States for the Security Council to fulfil its \r\nmandate and fully play its role, particularly in situations \r\nof mass atrocities.\r\nThese initiatives on the regulation of the veto, which \r\nlook towards a more just and more responsible Council, \r\nare distinct and complementary to the overall reform of \r\nthe Council, of which France is an advocate. It is our \r\ncollective responsibility to take stock of our obligations \r\nin order to change the status quo in the interest of the \r\nUnited Nations. The difficulty of this reform must not \r\ndiminish its imperative necessity.\r\nMs. Bavdaž Kuret (Slovenia): We find ourselves in \r\nthis Hall once again to discuss the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil before we embark on the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. In this context, \r\nwe would first like to thank the Ambassadors of Romania \r\nand Tunisia for their leadership of the process during \r\nthe seventy-first session. We highly appreciate all the \r\ndocuments produced so far, including the elements of \r\ncommonality and issues for further consideration on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation and increase in the \r\nmembership in Security Council and related matters, \r\nprepared during the last intergovernmental negotiations \r\nsession. At the same time, we wish to congratulate the \r\nAmbassadors of the United Arab Emirates and Georgia \r\nand wish them all the best in their efforts to steer the \r\nprocess forward.\r\nSlovenia has been closely following all \r\nintergovernmental negotiations sessions, and we remain \r\ncommitted to continuing the discussions. However, we \r\nbelieve that the time has come to move forward. Early \r\nreform of the Security Council was supported by world \r\nleaders in 2005; some 12 years later, we are still debating \r\nit, so any reform can no longer be considered early.\r\nToday, we wish to make some general remarks on \r\nthe substance of the process. The intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations of the past session showed that there \r\nare a lot of commonalities upon which we can build, \r\nincluding the reconfirmation that such reform is to \r\nmake the Council more broadly representative, efficient \r\nand transparent and to further enhance its effectiveness \r\nand legitimacy in the implementation of its decisions. \r\nWe therefore know what our goals are, and the process \r\nmust continue to be driven by Member States.\r\nIn the past 25 years since resolution 47/62 was \r\nadopted, a lot has happened in the international \r\ncommunity. The world has changed significantly since \r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n4/29 17-37015\r\nthe end of the Second World War and the creation of \r\nthe United Nations, as well as since the latest changes \r\nin the Security Council. As representatives in a major \r\ninternational organization, we, together with the \r\nSecurity Council, which has the supreme responsibility \r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nhave an obligation to the people of the international \r\ncommunity for which the United Nations exists. We \r\ntherefore believe that membership in the Security \r\nCouncil is, above all, a serious responsibility.\r\nOn more concrete issues, Slovenia is in favour \r\nof expanding the membership of the Council in both \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories. When \r\nit comes to the category of elected or non-permanent \r\nmembers, we believe that enlargement would enable \r\na higher rate of rotation and greater democratic \r\nrepresentation in the Security Council. In this regard, \r\nSlovenia places high priority on the allocation of an \r\nadditional non-permanent seat for the Group of Eastern \r\nEuropean States. In the past 25 years, the number of \r\nmembers of the Group of Eastern European States has \r\ndoubled, but its representation in the Security Council \r\nhas remained unchanged — one permanent and one \r\nnon-permanent seat. We also support additional seats \r\nfor African States.\r\nThere is a general agreement that the Security \r\nCouncil’s enlargement would improve the representation \r\nof those that are underrepresented or unrepresented, \r\nguaranteeing fair and democratic representation and \r\nbalancing the principles of responsibility, transparency \r\nand efficiency. Slovenia stands in favour of a Security \r\nCouncil seat allocation based on regional election \r\ngroups. When it comes to the size of a reformed \r\nCouncil, we are of the view that the Council needs to \r\nbe efficient and transparent and that its methods of \r\nwork will naturally have to be changed or adapted. Of \r\ncourse, it will be up to States members of the Council \r\nto deal with this issue, but we think that the majority \r\nof the membership will agree with us in saying that \r\nthe Council’s methods will have to be adapted if we \r\nwant it to be able to deal with the fast-changing and \r\nproliferating factors threatening international peace \r\nand security.\r\nAs a member of the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency group and a supporter of the French-\r\nMexican initiative, Slovenia advocates for a veto \r\nrestriction in cases of atrocity crimes and for maximum \r\nself-restraint in the use of the veto in all other cases.\r\nWhen it comes to the question of relations between \r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly, \r\nSlovenia can fully subscribe to the commonalities \r\nidentified in the intergovernmental negotiations during \r\nthe seventy-first session. The relationship should be \r\nmutually reinforcing and complementary. Slovenia can \r\nfully support the suggestions set out in the document of \r\nthe Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations of July \r\n2016. Resolutions on the revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly can also be taken into account.\r\nThis statement only briefly highlights some of the \r\nissues. We will be able to continue our deliberations \r\nduring future intergovernmental negotiations. However, \r\nlet me take this opportunity to once again express our \r\nstrong support for moving the process forward. We \r\nbelieve that the best way to do this and get out of the \r\ncurrent deadlock is to begin concrete negotiations \r\nbased on concrete text proposals.\r\nMr. Kapambwe (Zambia): I wish to begin by \r\naligning my country with the statement delivered earlier \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone, \r\nthe Coordinator of the African Union Committee of \r\nTen on Security Council Reform, who has articulated \r\nthe position of Africa on this important issue (see \r\nA/72/PV.41).\r\nI thank the President, first, for convening this \r\nround of intergovernmental negotiations and, secondly, \r\nfor appointing our two colleagues, Mr. Kaha Imnadze \r\nof Georgia, and Mrs. Lara Zaki Nusseibeh of the United \r\nArab Emirates, as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during the seventy-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Much will be expected not only \r\nfrom the President and the co-Chairs, but from all of \r\nus during the intergovernmental negotiations process.\r\nIt has been a painfully long time since the General \r\nAssembly began considering this issue. The various \r\nmilestones along the way, which my various colleagues \r\nhave referred to, do not put us in a good light. In \r\nSeptember, we marked the tenth anniversary of the \r\nconclusion of the Open-ended Working Group on the \r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase \r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other \r\nMatters related to the Security Council and the \r\ncreation of the intergovernmental negotiations process, \r\ncourtesy of decision 62/557, which started off as draft \r\nresolution A/61/L.69. Next year will mark the twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary of the establishment of the Open-\r\nended Working Group, which was the precursor to the \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 5/29\r\nintergovernmental negotiations. The year after that, in \r\n2019, we shall mark 40 years since this item was put on \r\nthe General Assembly agenda.\r\nI often hear us blame a lack of political will for \r\nour failure to achieve progress, but whose lack of \r\npolitical will are we talking about? It is certainly not \r\nour leaders who lack political will. In 2000, at the \r\nMillennium Summit, our leaders could not have been \r\nclearer when they gave us the task of expediting the \r\nreform of the Security Council. In 2005, at the World \r\nSummit, when marking the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations, leaders expressed concern at the slow \r\npace of the reform. Therefore, when it is suggested that \r\nthere is a lack of political will, are we implying that our \r\nHeads of State come here, implore us to make progress \r\nand then turn around and give us contrary instructions \r\nwhen they return to our capitals? Or are there other \r\ncustodians of political will above or more powerful \r\nthan the Heads of State? Could it be that this lack of \r\npolitical will exists only at the levels of our Missions \r\nand our administrative bureaucracies at Headquarters?\r\nI have no doubt that we can make progress and \r\nachieve the goals espoused by our leaders within a \r\nreasonable time frame. However, that will happen \r\nonly when we, at the level of our Missions, and the \r\nvarious experts at our administrative headquarters, \r\nactually believe in the process. The starting point is to \r\nbelieve — to genuinely believe — in the United Nations. \r\nWe must all believe that this is our United Nations and \r\nthat it is in all our interests to preserve and protect \r\nthe United Nations and project it forward, now and in \r\nfuture. We need to believe that what is good for the \r\nUnited Nations is good for all of us and that what is bad \r\nfor the United Nations is ultimately bad for all of us. We \r\nneed to believe in the oneness of our world, our oneness \r\nwith each other and our oneness with our world.\r\nI am aware of the fact that today is not the day to \r\nstart the negotiations. Our co-Chairs will advise us in \r\nthat regard in due course. It is, however, never too early \r\nto caution that if we do not make fundamental changes in \r\nthe framework and the process of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, we shall not make any more progress than \r\nwas made before. We must reflect on what has worked \r\nand what has not. More importantly, we must have the \r\ncourage and the determination to change that which \r\nneeds to be changed.\r\nIn my view, one thing needs to be done is to agree \r\non what status we should give to the outcome documents \r\nthat have been issued at the end of each round of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. For the moment, those \r\ndocuments are merely reference papers that we often \r\ncite in subsequent rounds but which bind no one to \r\nanything said in them. Another issue that we need to \r\naddress relates to the way in which we take decisions.\r\nLet me end with a small comment relative to those \r\nwho argue that the veto should not be extended to new \r\npermanent members of the Security Council. Africa \r\nwould have found that acceptable if the argument were \r\nthat the veto should be abolished altogether. That is the \r\nideal position contained in Africa’s Ezulwini Consensus. \r\nBut we also believe that what is good for the goose is \r\ngood for the gander. Africa is not prepared — and I \r\nrepeat, not prepared — to accept the status of second-\r\nclass citizen. The African permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council either will have no veto because the \r\nveto has been abolished for all or they will have the \r\nveto as long as any other permanent member, old or \r\nnew, has a veto. That request is neither unreasonable \r\nnor undeserved.\r\nWe come from a bad history — a history of slavery, \r\ndomination, racial discrimination, colonialism and \r\napartheid. Africa has always been at the bottom or the \r\none left behind. We have no intention of moving into \r\na bad future. Africa cannot and will not accept to be \r\ntreated like a child who cannot be trusted to exercise \r\nthe veto responsibly.\r\nWhen one is not at the table, one is on the menu. \r\nFor too long, Africa has not been at the table. We are \r\ntired of being on the menu.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Maldives): At the outset, I wish \r\nto express my appreciation to the President for having \r\nconvened this important debate to carry forward the \r\ndialogue on Security Council reform. We welcome \r\nhis decision to appoint Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, \r\nPermanent Representative of the United Arab \r\nEmirates, and Ambassador Kaha Imnadze, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Georgia, to steer the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process forward. I also wish to express \r\nour appreciation to Ambassador Ion Jinga, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Romania, and Ambassador Mohamed \r\nKhaled Khiari, Permanent Representative of Tunisia, \r\nthe outgoing co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, for the exemplary manner in which they \r\nconducted the work of those negotiations.\r\nThe past 72 years have witnessed an extraordinary \r\nperiod of relative peace — a long peace that is \r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n6/29 17-37015\r\nunparalleled in human history. The United Nations \r\ncreated the conditions enabling peace to prevail over \r\nwar. The United Nations has grown from 51 countries \r\nat its inception in 1945 to 193 Member States today, \r\nrepresenting the most universal community of nations. \r\nThe Organization has delivered aid, supported peace \r\nand cultivated norms and values the world over without \r\nregard for size or might. Yet, despite its numerous \r\nsuccesses, we have not been able to do full justice to \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations continue to be \r\nnon-representative.\r\nThe United Nations and its Security Council, which \r\nis the only body authorized to deploy troops under the \r\nUnited Nations banner or to take punitive action, were \r\nstructured according to the needs and the realities of the \r\ntime. Yet that reality has changed most profoundly. The \r\nworld has changed. The United Nations has changed. \r\nThe way in which we understand security, the means \r\nto sustain peace, has changed. We have new members, \r\nnew approaches and new dimensions. Yet here at the \r\nUnited Nations, we persist in our old ways.\r\nSince 1979, the Maldives has maintained a consistent \r\nposition on the reform of the Security Council. The \r\nnumber of permanent members on the Council must \r\nbe increased. At the time of its inception in 1945, the \r\nUnited Nations had fewer members. Most countries in \r\nthis Hall were not independent then. But now we are. \r\nAnd we are here to stay. And we deserve our say. We \r\nmust make the permanent membership — those holding \r\nthe veto power — more representative. We believe that \r\nevery continent must have at least one permanent seat, \r\nref lecting the political and the economic realities of our \r\ntime. The principle of equal geographical representation \r\nmust be the underlying principle of our work as we \r\ntry to find a feasible formula for going forward in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nRevising the number and the composition of the \r\npermanent seats is only one aspect of the reform. A \r\nmore important dimension must be to increase the \r\nnumber of non-permanent seats. We believe that the \r\nmembership of the Security Council should come from \r\nboth developing and developed countries, including \r\nsmall island developing States, so as to reflect the \r\ndiversity of the United Nations membership. That is \r\nthe spirit of the formula devised in the Charter, which \r\nsets out two criteria: first, the contribution of Members \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nand to the other purposes of the Organization and, \r\nsecondly, equitable geographical distribution.\r\nLet us consider the first element. Every country \r\ncan bring diversity. Every country can offer unique \r\nperspectives. While traditional concepts of security \r\nstill constitute an important dimension, non-traditional \r\nemerging threats are increasingly gaining traction \r\nacross the world. Those threats include pandemics, the \r\nfrequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the \r\nimpacts of climate change, the scarcity of and associated \r\ncompetition over resources such as food, water and fuel, \r\nand other development challenges. Those are the new \r\nchallenges to international peace and security. Those \r\nare the new frontiers of security.\r\nIn order for the Security Council to be able to \r\nreach those frontiers, we need a diversity of viewpoints \r\nand experiences that can assist us in addressing such \r\ndiverse challenges. There is therefore a need to redefine \r\nold yardsticks for measuring contributions to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We \r\nmay be small, but we have strength in our shoulders and \r\ngrit in our bones to carry the lofty ideals and aspirations \r\nthat define this Organization. Diverse members that can \r\ncontribute to such new, non-traditional understandings \r\nof peace and security must be included.\r\nIt is our firm belief that every country deserves an \r\nopportunity to serve. The second criterion — equitable \r\ngeographical distribution — is the cornerstone of \r\nthe United Nations. Every country, be it mighty or \r\ntiny, rich or poor, deserves to be heard and have a \r\nsay. Yet, that is largely not the case. That imperative \r\nis significantly more valid in the Security Council, \r\nwhere every country must be heard. While new threats \r\nare redefining our conception of security and how we \r\napproach international peace, the countries that suffer \r\nthe most are not represented.\r\nThe Maldives, for example, was the 117th country \r\nto join the United Nations. Of the 116 that joined before \r\nus, 104 have already served on the Security Council. \r\nAfter half a century, we have not had the opportunity \r\nto do so, as is the case with nearly all small island \r\ndeveloping States. We believe that larger countries, \r\nespecially those that have served on the Council, have a \r\nmoral and, indeed, a Charter-based obligation to ensure \r\nthat small countries, especially those that have not \r\nserved before, get a fair chance.\r\nWe believe that every country is determined to \r\nserve, determined to make its contribution in its own \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 7/29\r\nway to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity and determined to uphold the principles of \r\nthe United Nations. And one may ask, what is stopping \r\nthose countries? In theory, every country has the same \r\nopportunity to compete. Any country can put forward \r\nits candidature, run in the election and participate in \r\nthe competition.\r\nBut, I ask the Assembly whether the competition \r\nis fair anymore. For small States, it is not fair. The \r\ncompetition is tough. It is expensive. If a country \r\nwishes to undertake an effective campaign for a seat \r\non the Security Council, that country is expected to \r\nspend enormous amounts of money and resources in \r\norder to secure votes. Even when a country chooses to \r\nnot adopt such campaign practices, it is forced to do so \r\nin order to overcome perceptions about the country’s \r\ncapacity, about the country’s drive or passion, or about \r\nthe country’s seriousness. Countries that cannot afford \r\nto spend a fortune on their campaign for the Security \r\nCouncil lose out.\r\nWe believe that that is most certainly why only eight \r\nsmall island developing States have managed to secure a \r\nseat on the Council since the establishment of the United \r\nNations. Small countries can no longer campaign on an \r\nequal footing. That means that countries that need to be \r\nheard and countries that can bring unique perspectives \r\nand fresh, new ideas never end up on the Council. \r\nEquitable geographical distribution increasingly looks \r\nlike a principle with a financial price tag.\r\nThe Maldives can and will change that. We hope \r\nto get elected to the Council for the term of 2019-2020 \r\nin the election to be held in June 2018. If elected, the \r\nMaldives will, in collaboration with our partners, \r\nbuild a reservoir of hope, trust and credibility that \r\nwill redefine the ordering principle in multilateral \r\ndiplomacy, transforming it into an order in which \r\nright will become might. Yet, that can happen only if \r\nthe General Assembly joins hands in upholding the \r\nobligations of the Charter of the United Nations. We \r\nurge the General Assembly and individual Member \r\nStates to uphold the principles that they agreed to when \r\nthey signed up for the United Nations.\r\nThe General Assembly can do more. It should \r\ndo more. The Assembly can accelerate reforms by \r\ncreating opportunities for every country, by upholding \r\nthe principles of fairness and equitable geographical \r\ndistribution and by joining hands with the Maldives in \r\ncrafting shared solutions for our shared destiny.\r\nMr. Tenya (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): We appreciate \r\nthe convening of today’s meeting, which touches on \r\na central theme for the future of the Organization, \r\nnamely, the issue of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council. \r\nWe welcome the appointment of the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Georgia, Ambassador Kaha Imnadze, \r\nand the Permanent Representative of the United Arab \r\nEmirates, Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, as co-Chairs of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations during the current \r\nsession. I assure them that they have the full support of \r\nmy delegation.\r\nIf anything has been evident during the long process \r\nof the negotiations for the reform of the Security Council, \r\nit is the overwhelming agreement of the membership \r\non the imperative need to adapt the structure of our \r\nOrganization to changes in the international context. \r\nWe continue to observe, unfortunately, the inaction of \r\nthe Security Council in the face of serious violations \r\nof human rights and international humanitarian law, \r\nwhich further affects the perception of international \r\npublic opinion of the Council’s performance, thereby \r\nalso affecting its legitimacy and credibility.\r\nThat is why the time has come to act. We cannot \r\nlimit ourselves to reiterating our well-known national \r\npositions over and over again. We must make the \r\nnecessary concessions and process the available options \r\nto move towards real negotiation work. None of that \r\nwill be possible without a real commitment to obtaining \r\ntangible and balanced results, within the framework of \r\na process that must always be transparent and inclusive.\r\nThe remarkable changes that the international \r\nsystem has undergone in recent decades make it \r\nimperative to increase the number of members of the \r\nSecurity Council. With that said, such an increase \r\nshould be carried out with restraint, since the possible \r\ngains in terms of the representativeness of the Council \r\nshould not be undermined by a loss of efficiency in the \r\nperformance of the Council’s work. In such efforts, it is \r\nessential, in our view, that special emphasis be placed \r\non the expansion of seats for those regions that are not \r\nproperly represented at present. However, as long as the \r\nnecessary consensus is reached to carry out a deeper \r\nand more comprehensive reform of the Council, we \r\nwould like to consider the provisional establishment of \r\nan intermediate category of non-permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council that would perform functions for a \r\nlonger period of time and could be evaluated biennially \r\nand re-elected for successive periods indefinitely.\r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n8/29 17-37015\r\nRegarding the issue of the veto, we wish to recall \r\nthat Peru has consistently supported commitments \r\naimed at limiting the use of the veto, especially in \r\ncases of genocide, crimes against humanity and \r\nsuccessive acts of f lagrant violations of human rights \r\nor international humanitarian law. We reiterate in that \r\nregard our support for the initiative taken by France and \r\nMexico, as well as for the code of conduct submitted \r\nby the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency \r\ngroup, of which my country is a member.\r\nThroughout the previous session there was a healthy \r\nexchange of ideas, presenting contrasting positions, all \r\nof which constituted, in practice, a kind of negotiation \r\nprocess. That convinces us even more of the gains that \r\nwould come from a process that produced a text that \r\nenabled us to initiate formal negotiations. We anticipate \r\nthat the issue will see increasing support, since as of \r\ntoday it has the backing of at least three quarters of \r\nthe membership.\r\nFurthermore, we have also seen in recent months \r\nthe promotion of a closer link between the Security \r\nCouncil and the Secretary-General of the Organization. \r\nA similar trend has been observed in the relationship \r\nbetween the Security Council and the various bodies \r\nof the United Nations, such as the General Assembly \r\nand the Economic and Social Council, with productive \r\nmeetings held by their respective Presidents. Peru, \r\nwhich will join the Security Council as a non-permanent \r\nmember starting in January 2018, will encourage that \r\ntype of effort, as we consider it highly beneficial for the \r\nCouncil to coordinate, integrate and generate synergies \r\nwith other bodies.\r\nTo conclude, Peru reaffirms its full commitment \r\nto continue working towards a lasting and effective \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nMs. Rodríguez Abascal (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe would like to begin by acknowledging the \r\ncommitment of the President of the General Assembly \r\nto the reform of the Security Council. We take this \r\nopportunity to convey to Ambassador Kaha Imnadze \r\nof Georgia and Ambassador Lana Zaki Nussseibeh of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates the full cooperation of Cuba \r\nin the hope that the intergovernmental negotiations can \r\nachieve progress. We commend the efforts made by the \r\nco-Chairs during the previous session, the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Romania and Tunisia.\r\nAll delegations are aware that the consideration \r\nof the question of the Security Council membership \r\nexpansion and other matters, such as its working \r\nmethods, which has had various designations over \r\nthe years, such as consultations, exchanges and, more \r\nrecently, intergovernmental negotiations, has now lasted \r\nmore than 25 years. Lately, some preliminary results \r\nhave been achieved, but, let us be clear, they have been \r\nextremely limited in scope, as they do not address the \r\nfundamental issues, on which there still remain broad \r\ndifferences. If a profound negotiating effort is not made \r\non the salient issues, another 25 years will come and go \r\nat the Assembly without satisfactory results.\r\nThe process of Security Council reform must be \r\ncomprehensive, that is, it must include all substantive \r\nmatters, such as, inter alia, the question of membership, \r\nregional representation, the agenda of the Council, its \r\nworking methods, its decision-making process and the \r\nissue of the veto. The process must also achieve the \r\nwidest possible acceptance by Member States.\r\nThe reform must ensure that the Council’s agenda \r\nreflects the needs and interests of both developing and \r\ndeveloped countries and is characterized by a rational, \r\nnon-selective and non-arbitrary objective. With respect \r\nto regional representation, the size of the Security \r\nCouncil’s expansion and the categories of members, \r\nCuba attaches great importance to the issue of regional \r\nrepresentation, given that the current composition of the \r\nSecurity Council does not reflect geopolitical realities \r\nand needs, therefore, to be rebalanced. There is no doubt \r\nat all that developing countries are underrepresented \r\nin the Council, which undermines the interest in and \r\nthe authority and credibility of the Council. In view of \r\nthe aforementioned considerations, the main goal of \r\nthe expansion of the Council should be to rectify the \r\ninsufficient representation of the developing countries \r\nof Africa, Asia and Latin America.\r\nIn the opinion of the Cuban delegation, the expansion \r\nof the categories should consist of an increase in the \r\nnumber of new permanent members from two African \r\ncountries, two developing countries in Asia and two \r\ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean. We feel \r\nthat the number of non-permanent members should \r\nbe increased to a total of at least 15 members. The \r\nnew permanent members must have exactly the same \r\nprerogatives and rights as the current ones do, without \r\nestablishing selective or discriminatory criteria. Cuba \r\ndeclares that the obsolete and undemocratic right \r\nof the veto must be abolished. If it is not eliminated \r\nimmediately, the new permanent members must also \r\nhave that prerogative.\r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 9/29\r\nIf the representation of developed and developing \r\ncountries in the Council is not expanded, the Council \r\nwill become even less representative and therefore, less \r\nlegitimate and effective. Cuba is not in favour of the \r\ncreation of new categories or subcategories of members. \r\nNew categories would increase existing differences and \r\nstimulate division among the members of the Council, \r\ninstead of contributing to its better functioning.\r\nCuba advocates that the Council should be expanded \r\nto at least 26 members. With that figure alone, the ratio \r\nbetween members of the Security Council and the \r\nMember States of the United Nations would be closer to \r\nthe ratio that it had when the Organization was founded. \r\nCuba will not support any partial or selective expansion, \r\nnor any increase in the composition of the members of \r\nthe Council to the detriment of developing countries.\r\nWith respect to the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil, in particular the presentation of the Council’s \r\nannual report to the General Assembly, Cuba regrets \r\nthat that report remains a mere descriptive account of \r\nthe meetings, activities and decisions of the Council, \r\nwhen the vast majority of the Member States of the \r\nUnited Nations has repeatedly expressed the need for \r\na comprehensive and analytical report on the work of \r\nthat body.\r\nWe reiterate that the Security Council must, in \r\nthe exercise of its duties, of which the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security is its primary \r\nresponsibility, as stipulated by the Charter of the United \r\nNations, act on behalf of all Member States, and it must, \r\ntherefore, comply with the obligations established in \r\nArticles 15 and 24 of the Charter, namely, to submit \r\nspecial reports on its actions for the consideration of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nCuba reiterates its concern over the lack of \r\ntransparency and democracy in the Security Council. \r\nAlthough during the most recent period there has \r\nbeen an increase in the number of public meetings \r\nand unprecedented consultations and exchanges with \r\nMember States during the selection and appointment \r\nprocess of the Secretary-General, the trend persists \r\nfor the Council to work mainly in closed formats and \r\nmake decisions without addressing the concerns of \r\nnon-permanent members. At present, the Security \r\nCouncil is neither transparent, nor democratic, \r\nnor representative.\r\nUrgent changes are required in its working methods \r\nso as to enable real participation on the part of all of its \r\nmembers in its work and decision-making process. To \r\nthat end, its rules and regulations must be formalized, \r\nas they have been provisional for more than 70 years. In \r\nthat connection, Cuba again proposes that closed-door \r\nconsultations in the Security Council be the exception.\r\nIn addition to changing its working methods and \r\ncomposition, the Council must adjust its functions to \r\nfollow its mandate as established in the Charter and \r\nrespect all resolutions of the General Assembly, the \r\nmain deliberative body for the adoption of policies and \r\nthe representation of the United Nations. The Security \r\nCouncil’s tendency to consider issues and assume \r\nfunctions that do not correspond to its mandate, thereby \r\nusurping the role assigned to other bodies, particularly \r\nthe General Assembly, must cease. We underline the \r\nneed to achieve an adequate balance between the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, pursuant to \r\nthe Charter.\r\nA reform of the United Nations, such as the one \r\ncurrently being promoted by the Secretary-General,will \r\nnot be effective or real without an in-depth reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. A truly transparent, representative, \r\ndemocratic and efficient body is urgently needed.\r\nMr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me first of all to congratulate the two new \r\nco-Chairs, my good friends the Ambassadors of \r\nGeorgia and the United Arab Emirates, for having been \r\nassigned the important responsibility of chairing the \r\ninformal intergovernmental negotiations at the current \r\nsession. They are two splendid professionals who will, \r\nI am sure, be able to skilfully and effectively spearhead \r\nthose difficult negotiations. Before beginning my \r\nstatement, I wish to state that I fully endorse the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Italy on behalf \r\nof the Uniting for Consensus group (see A/72/PV.41).\r\nI will attempt to briefly respond to three questions. \r\nThe first of them concerns the main reason for the \r\nstate of gridlock in which the negotiations for Security \r\nCouncil reform have found themselves for so many \r\nyears. The answer is as complex as the story is long \r\nbut, in my opinion, one of the factors that has weighed \r\nmost upon that state of deadlock is the inflexibility of \r\nthe positions of various groups.\r\nNevertheless, in recent years we have appreciated \r\nthe fact that a number of States have insisted on \r\nbroadening the membership of the Security Council in \r\nterms of both permanent and non-permanent members. \r\nIn the world today, at least in my view, it is difficult \r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n10/29 17-37015\r\nto imagine or conceive what the advantages might be \r\nof having a Security Council with more permanent \r\nmembers, instead of a Council in which all members \r\nare elected. I believe the latter would ensure greater \r\nrotation in the Council membership, which would also \r\nmean that a high number of States that have never been \r\nable to participate in the work of the Security Council \r\nwould be able to stand for election. I also believe that \r\nusurping the General Assembly’s power to periodically \r\nelect members of the Security Council — especially if we \r\nbroaden the permanent membership category — would \r\nsignificantly affect levels of representativeness in \r\nthe Council.\r\nMy second question is as to which group has shown \r\ngreatest f lexibility in the negotiation process. The \r\nAssembly is well aware that Spain belongs to the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group — a group that has, on more than \r\none occasion, been termed a group of “spoilers” in the \r\nnegotiations that have taken place in recent years. I \r\nwish to recall here that the Uniting for Consensus group \r\nwas created a number of years ago now with a proposal \r\nto increase the membership of the Security Council to \r\n25, including 10 new elected members for a term of two \r\nyears with the possibility of re-election. The Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group then moved from the proposal to \r\nincrease the number of non-permanent members elected \r\nfor two years to a new proposal circulated during the \r\nprevious intergovernmental negotiations on 8 May to \r\ninclude a category for long-term membership seats. My \r\ndelegation believes that, with that new category, we \r\nwould be able to reach common ground, consensus and \r\nunderstanding on the substantive issue at play in the \r\nnegotiation process.\r\nMy third question is with respect to our overarching \r\ngoal with that proposal. Logically, the first objective \r\nwould be to finalize the negotiations, which have been \r\ndragging on for too long. However, one of the major \r\ngoals of the Uniting for Consensus group’s proposal \r\nwithin a new Security Council is to give a rightful \r\nplace to and satisfy the needs of a region that has been \r\nneglected and maltreated within our Security Council \r\ntoday. I am referring, of course, to the African Group.\r\nWe believe that, with the proposal to have longer-\r\nterm seats and all the details previously outlined by the \r\nAmbassador of Italy, we would rectify that historical \r\ninjustice inflicted upon the African continent. We would \r\nalso allow a large number of small States to stand for \r\nelection to the Security Council. I will not go into any \r\nfurther detail here, as this is a general debate and I think \r\nthat the positions of various delegations — particularly \r\nthat of Spain — are well-known. Nevertheless, I will \r\nconclude with two brief comments addressed to the \r\nco-Chairs of the new process.\r\nFirst of all, we stress the need for transparency. As \r\nthe Assembly is well aware, I believe that it is crucial \r\nthat we embark upon the negotiations in the spirit of full \r\ntransparency in order to ensure that all delegations are \r\nequally apprised of all the details of the reform under \r\nway.\r\nSecondly, the negotiations have to be predictable, \r\ninsofar as the leaps forward that we have managed to \r\nmake in the past have failed to produce tangible results \r\nand States have simply crystallized their positions, \r\nwhich is not ideal. I am convinced that, thanks to the \r\nquality of our co-Chairs, we will see important progress \r\nand be able to build on the major achievements that we \r\nhave previously accomplished.\r\nMr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China \r\nwelcomes the appointment by the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly of Ambassador Imnadze, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Georgia, and Ambassador Nusseibeh, \r\nPermanent Representative of the United Arab Emirates, \r\nas co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform during the current session \r\nof the General Assembly. We applaud the President’s \r\ncommitment to building a credible, transparent and \r\ninclusive intergovernmental negotiation process on \r\nSecurity Council reform, and China actively supports \r\nthe co-Chairs in their work.\r\nDuring the intergovernmental negotiations at the \r\nseventy-first session, in-depth and frank discussions \r\ntook place on the five clusters of key issues concerning \r\nSecurity Council reform, guided by the principle \r\nof having a Member State-led process and the \r\npackage approach. The constructive momentum of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations was maintained. \r\nChina commends those developments and appreciates \r\nthe efforts of the former co-Chairs, the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Romania and Tunisia.\r\nSecurity Council reform affects the immediate \r\ninterests of all Member States and the long-term \r\ndevelopment of the Organization. It also bears on the \r\nfuture of the global collective security system. Security \r\nCouncil reform should be conducive to building a \r\nglobal governance system featuring joint consultations, \r\nextensive participation and shared benefits, which will \r\nhelp elevate the Council’s authority and efficiency and \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 11/29\r\nlead to better delivery on its mandate as enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nChina has always been an active supporter of \r\nthe rational and necessary reform of the Council and \r\nadvocates that, as a priority, greater representation \r\nand voice in the Council should be given to developing \r\ncountries, especially the African States. A wider \r\nmembership, including in particular small and \r\nmedium-sized countries, which make up the majority \r\nof Member States, would enable greater access to \r\nthe Council, allowing such countries to be involved \r\nin its decision-making and play a bigger part in \r\nsafeguarding international peace and security. The \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process is an important \r\navenue through which Member States can exchange \r\nviews on issues concerning Council reform, deepen \r\ntheir understanding and narrow their differences. \r\nThe comments, positions and proposals of the broad \r\nmembership on Council reform form the basis of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nChina supports the co-Chairs in their efforts \r\nto perform their functions and fulfil their duties \r\npursuant to decision 62/557, adhering to the principle \r\nof a Member States-led process and the package \r\napproach and encouraging Member States to engage \r\nin democratic consultations on the five clusters of \r\nkey issues in order to achieve the broadest consensus. \r\nIt is our hope that Member States and the co-Chairs \r\nwill work hand in hand to contribute constructively \r\nto the intergovernmental negotiation process without \r\nartificially setting deadlines for the reform, trying to \r\nrush immature reform proposals through or launching \r\ntext-based negotiations before the right conditions are \r\nat hand.\r\nWe should work together to maintain unity among \r\nMember States. Together with all parties, China stands \r\nready to advance Security Council reform in a way that \r\nserves both the common interest of all Member States \r\nand the long-term interests of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Plasai (Thailand): Once again, we are gathered \r\nhere to remind ourselves that the world today is different \r\nfrom what it was when the United Nations first came \r\ninto being seven decades ago. Today’s geopolitical \r\nlandscape has been transformed. Modern-day conflicts \r\nare different and more complex. That requires us to \r\nadapt. Yet the Security Council, the organ responsible \r\nfor one of the key pillars of the United Nations activities, \r\nnamely, the maintenance of peace and security, is the \r\nvery one that has defied adaptation for the longest time. \r\nToday, we are meeting in a slightly different context. We \r\nare meeting at a specific juncture in time when there is \r\na clear momentum for reform. We have our Secretary-\r\nGeneral to thank for that, and Thailand supports his \r\nreform agenda, in particular his vision to restructure \r\nthe peace and security architecture.\r\nWe must adapt the management, operations and \r\nstructures of the Secretariat to make the United Nations \r\nmore fit for purpose, coherent and properly aligned so \r\nas to prevent conflict and sustain peace. We hope that \r\nthe current momentum for reform is an opportunity \r\nto inject urgency into the Security Council reform \r\nprocess. We are under no illusion that the reform agenda \r\nfor the United Nations and the Security Council will \r\nbe challenging. The latter reform, in particular, will \r\nrequire a constructive, pragmatic and results-oriented \r\napproach from all Member States if we are to realize \r\nany progress. Changes are needed in the composition \r\nand working methods of the Council so as to reflect \r\ncurrent realities. Thailand joins other Member States \r\nin pushing for those changes and has been actively \r\nengaged in the intergovernmental negotiations. We \r\nwelcome the progress made during the previous session, \r\nwhich circulated the food-for-thought document, which, \r\nwe hope, offers an excellent template for text-based \r\nnegotiations in the near future.\r\nI take this opportunity to express appreciation \r\nto Mr. Ion Jinga, Permanent Representative of \r\nRomania, and Mr. Mohamed Khaled Khiari, \r\nPermanent Representative of Tunisia, for their hard \r\nwork and dedication throughout the previous round \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations. We also welcome \r\nthe appointment of Mr. Kaha Imnadze, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Georgia, and Mrs. Lana Zaki \r\nNusseibeh, Permanent Representative of the United \r\nArab Emirates, as the co-Chairs for the upcoming \r\nsession. We wish them every success. In our view, three \r\naspects are key to the reform of the Security Council.\r\nFirst, there seems to be a broad convergence of \r\nviews on the merits of expanding the membership of \r\nthe Council, whether through the expansion of both of \r\nthe existing categories or through the introduction of \r\ninterim or intermediate options. We reiterate our idea, \r\npresented in November 2014, of an interim category of \r\nmembership. Accordingly, aspiring permanent members \r\nwould have the opportunity to prove themselves and \r\nimmediately stand for re-election for a second term. \r\nIf they are re-elected, a review could be conducted on \r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n12/29 17-37015\r\nthe possible expansion of permanent members based \r\non conditions and criteria to be established. In line \r\nwith views expressed by other Member States, we \r\nagree that the size of the reformed Council should be \r\nin the mid-twenties. However, any expansion must take \r\ninto account a greater and a more equitable regional \r\nrepresentation, as well as the varying sizes of regional \r\ngroups. It must also reflect the plurality and evolving \r\nrealities of the United Nations membership.\r\nSecondly, we are of the view that the right of the \r\nveto has been both an important safeguard and an \r\nobstacle to the unity of purpose and decisive action of \r\nthe Council. Thailand continues to support the code of \r\nconduct with regard to the use of the veto, as elaborated \r\nby the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency \r\ngroup. We also support the French-Mexican initiative \r\non the voluntary limit on the use of the veto in cases of \r\nmass atrocities.\r\nThirdly, we support strengthened dialogue and \r\npartnership between the Council and the General \r\nAssembly so as to support and enhance transparency. \r\nEfforts have already been made to strengthen regular \r\nconsultations between the Presidents of the two bodies, \r\nand we commend those efforts. In addition, members \r\nof the Council can do more to engage the wider \r\nmembership of the United Nations, particularly on \r\nissues with broader impact and complexity.\r\nSecurity Council reform remains unfinished. Let \r\nus use the current momentum of the United Nations \r\nreform agenda to inject renewed determination into \r\nthe process. Let us turn stumbling blocks into stepping \r\nstones for a reform that is acceptable to all and aligned \r\nwith the rest of the Organization, so as to achieve \r\ngenuine progress in designing a Security Council with \r\ngreater representation, credibility, legitimacy and, \r\nabove all, effectiveness.\r\nMr. Heusgen (Germany): Germany aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nJapan on behalf of the Group of Four this morning (see \r\nA/72/PV.41). Allow me to add a few remarks.\r\nIn Germany, we have a saying: “The squirrel feeds \r\nitself slowly, but surely.” Everyone might rightfully be \r\nwondering what a squirrel has to do with reforming \r\nthe Security Council. Well, the saying means, first \r\nand foremost, that the squirrel does not give up. It will \r\npersevere and succeed in gathering everything it needs \r\nin time for winter, as all will be able to see once again in \r\nCentral Park this year. Similar to a squirrel collecting \r\nacorns and nuts, one by one, States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations have over the years collected all the \r\nelements necessary for achieving the comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council. The pieces of the puzzle \r\nare all there. However, in order to achieve progress, we \r\nnow have to find the courage to rearrange the pieces \r\nand assemble the puzzle. To be able do that, we need \r\na concise negotiating text that will allow us to finally \r\nbegin concrete, results-oriented negotiations.\r\nLet me be very honest. We all know that there are \r\ndiffering positions in the General Assembly pertaining \r\nto the reform of the Security Council, but, in my view, \r\nthat is in an argument in favour of, rather than against, \r\nembarking on concrete negotiations. For it is in the \r\nframework of negotiations that we will able to narrow \r\ndown differences, and maybe eventually bridge them.\r\nA startling 85 per cent of Member States have \r\nrequested such text-based negotiations. We have just \r\nlistened to our colleague from Thailand, who has \r\nbeen asking for such text-based negotiations, and \r\nour colleague from Spain speaking on behalf of the \r\nUniting for Consensus group (see A/72/PV.41), who \r\nstated that that group has shown itself to be the most \r\nf lexible of all groups seeking Security Council reform. \r\nWe should therefore not lose any more time. Why? \r\nBecause it matters, and it matters that we finally make \r\nprogress. It matters how that central organ responsible \r\nfor maintaining international peace and security is \r\ncomposed. It matters whether that important body \r\nreflects the realities of the twenty-first century. It \r\nmatters in terms of ensuring its future authority and \r\nthe relevance of its decisions. It matters to be able to \r\nface current global challenges to peace and security. \r\nIt matters for our international order and for a strong \r\nUnited Nations at its core, because we need a strong, \r\nlegitimate United Nations that can help us restore \r\nconfidence in global governance and cooperation.\r\nWe very much look forward to working together \r\nwith everyone, in particular with the new co-Chairs \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations, Ambassador \r\nLana Zaki Nusseibeh and Ambassador Kaha Imnadze. \r\nWe congratulate both of them, and we also express \r\nour willingness to work with the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI would like to congratulate the President of \r\nthe General Assembly on his strong commitment to \r\nresponding positively to calls for change. I can only \r\nunderline what the President said this morning — it is \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 13/29\r\ntime for action. Let us bring our nuts and acorns together, \r\nsurvive the winter and ultimately see a luminous spring \r\nthat brings us closer to Security Council reform.\r\nMr. Matjila (South Africa): My delegation and \r\nI welcome the commitment that the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly has thus far demonstrated to the long-\r\noutstanding process aimed at the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. We appreciate that he has identified reform of \r\nthe Security Council as a key priority of his presidency. \r\nI therefore take this opportunity to reassure him of my \r\ndelegation’s unwavering support in that endeavour and \r\ntrust that through his leadership, considerable progress \r\nwill be made in moving the process forward.\r\nAllow me also to congratulate the incoming \r\nco-Chairs, Mrs. Lana Zaki Nusseibeh and Mr. Kaha \r\nlmnadze, the Permanent Representatives of the United \r\nArab Emirates and Georgia, respectively, for assuming \r\nthe co-chairship of the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nSouth Africa urges the co-Chairs to devote all their \r\nefforts to reinvigorating the negotiations process, \r\nwith the aim of achieving the momentum needed to \r\nmove discussions on reform forward. South Africa \r\nfirmly believes that continued, direct and enhanced \r\nengagement by Member States is required.\r\nSouth Africa aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representatives of Sierra Leone, on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States, and of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, on behalf of the L.69 \r\ngroup of developing countries (see A/72/PV.41). I \r\nwish to make the following additional remarks in my \r\nnational capacity.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council remains of the \r\nutmost importance for South Africa. In 2005, with the \r\nadoption of the Ezulwini Consensus, Africa made its \r\nposition clear with regard to the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. The goal is\r\n“to be fully represented in all of the decision-\r\nmaking organs of the United Nations, particularly \r\nin the Security Council, which is the principal \r\ndecision-making organ of the United Nations in \r\nmatters relating to international peace and security”.\r\nThat remains our primary goal. The African \r\nCommon Position is also very clear in its call for \r\nthe expansion of the Security Council in both the \r\npermanent and the non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership in order to address the current inequality \r\nin its composition, and for new permanent members \r\nto be afforded the same privileges as the current \r\npermanent members.\r\nI also wish to stress that, while Africa remains \r\nthe most marginalized continent with regard to the \r\ncomposition of the Council, the underrepresentation of \r\nLatin America and Asia remains a challenge as well and \r\nalso needs to be addressed urgently. The 2005 World \r\nSummit called for the speedy and urgent reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, and South Africa can only express \r\nits concern that 12 years after the Summit, the process \r\nis still in its infancy. Furthermore, my delegation \r\nexpresses concern at the lack of meaningful progress \r\nin the intergovernmental negotiations, and we reiterate \r\nour view that it is only through text-based negotiations \r\nthat progress can be achieved by identifying points of \r\nconvergences and agreement, thereby providing the \r\nopportunity to bridge our differences.\r\nThe framework document that was unanimously \r\nadopted at the sixty-ninth session and the convergence \r\nissues identified at the seventy-first session, as well as the \r\nfood-for-thought document of 2017, entitled “Elements \r\nof commonality and issues for further consideration on \r\nthe question of equitable representation and increase \r\nin the membership in the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”, which was produced during the seventy-\r\nfirst session, all offer a solid basis for text-based \r\nnegotiations. However, in order for those documents \r\nand agreements to produce meaningful results, we need \r\nto adapt the way in which we have been doing business \r\nin the Organization. South Africa is disappointed that \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations have turned into \r\nanother open-ended process with no real urgency to \r\nits work and Member States falling into the practice \r\nof issuing statements and restatements of previously \r\nstated positions.\r\nIt is appropriate to underline the significant \r\nSecurity Council reform efforts that have been \r\nadvanced throughout the history of the United Nations. \r\nThis year marks 72 years since the Security Council \r\nwas established in 1945. It has been 52 years since the \r\nfirst and, sadly, only expansion of the Security Council. \r\nIn little over a month from today, 11 December will \r\nmark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof resolution 47/62, which initiated the process of \r\nconsidering in the General Assembly the agenda item \r\ndealing with the Security Council reform and the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and the increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council.\r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n14/29 17-37015\r\nNext year will mark exactly a decade since the start \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations process, It will \r\nalso mark 13 years since the World Summit of 2005, \r\nwhich produced a unanimous agreement on an early \r\nreform of the Security Council. It is with deep regret \r\nthat, despite those efforts and processes regarding \r\nreform of the Security Council, no significant results \r\nhave been produced. It is for that reason that South \r\nAfrica wishes to propose the following.\r\nFirst, we should discuss and agree on the programme \r\nof work of the intergovernmental negotiations process \r\nduring the current session. We suggest that attention \r\nshould be given to developing a road map with clear, \r\nimplementable time frames for the immediate start \r\nof text-based negotiations. Addressing practicalities \r\nthat are in line with United Nations procedures does \r\nnot undermine the principle of transparency and \r\ninclusivity. It is important to underscore the fact that \r\n164 out of 193 countries of the United Nations want the \r\nimmediate commencement of text-based negotiations. \r\nThat overwhelming number amounts to more than \r\n80 per cent of the membership. The 164 countries \r\nencompass all regions of the United Nations: Africa, \r\nthe Group of Western European and other States, the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean Group, the Asia-Pacific \r\nGroup and the small island developing States, as well as \r\nsome of the members of the permanent five. That vital \r\npoint should not be ignored by anyone.\r\nSecondly, South Africa would welcome the idea of \r\nhaving a block of time — even a week — allocated per \r\nelement. That block of time would allow delegations to \r\nhave sufficient time to engage in interactive discussions, \r\nwhich is the only way to achieve progress.\r\nThirdly, the idea of ending the work of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in June 2018, as has \r\nbeen the case in the previous two sessions, does not \r\npromote the efficient utilization of time and denies the \r\nprocess an adequate opportunity for full discussions. \r\nIt also creates the impression that there is no urgency \r\nto the very important and long-outstanding process of \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my \r\ndelegation’s commitment to working with the President \r\nand other Member States to ensure that the current \r\nsession of the intergovernmental negotiations is a \r\nsuccess. We reiterate our call for the current session to \r\nproduce a fair and progressive outcome, so as to restore \r\nthe credibility and the legitimacy of the Council as one \r\nof the critical organs of the United Nations.\r\nHaving said that, my delegation would like to \r\nemphasize and reiterate the urgent need for the speedy \r\nreform of the Security Council. The world and the work \r\nof the Council have changed over the past 70 years. The \r\nstructure runs the risk of losing legitimacy, credibility \r\nand acceptance should we fail to affect the necessary \r\nand required reforms. The current stalemate in the \r\nCouncil and its glaring failure to carry out its historic \r\nmandate of maintaining international peace and security \r\nare largely attributed to its current configuration. That \r\nis why South Africa calls for urgent practical steps \r\nto be taken during the seventy-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Sandoval Mendiolea (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We thank Mr. Miroslav Lajčák for convening, \r\nduring the seventy-second session of the General \r\nAssembly, this debate on one of the most important \r\npending items of the United Nations: reforming the \r\nSecurity Council to bring it in line with the twenty-\r\nfirst century — a time when democracy, equality and \r\ninclusion must prevail. We welcome the new co-Chairs \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations, Ambassador \r\nKaha Imnadze of Georgia and Ambassador Lana \r\nZaki Nusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates. We \r\nexpress Mexico’s commitment to and cooperation with \r\ntheir efforts.\r\nAs we have reiterated for years, the reform process \r\nmust be carried out under the principles of transparency, \r\nimpartiality, objectivity and inclusion. It must take \r\non board the lessons learned in the previous sessions \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations — in terms of \r\nmanaging to create understandings and the mistakes \r\nmade in the process that have regrettably polarized the \r\nmembership — and thereby try to advance the reform \r\nprocess. Mexico recognizes the interest expressed by \r\nall the negotiating groups in continuing this exchange \r\nof ideas. However, we stress that the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council will require a genuine political will \r\nthat tones down individual interests and seeks in effect \r\nto benefit the Organization as a whole, so that it has the \r\nbroadest support possible.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by Ambassador Lambertini of Italy on behalf \r\nof the Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group. The UfC \r\ninitiative responds to the principles of resolution 62/557 \r\nbecause it was formulated in good faith. It is a proposal \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 15/29\r\nof commitment to attaining a Security Council that is \r\nmore representative, transparent, democratic, effective \r\nand accountable. The UfC has shown great f lexibility \r\nand transparency so as to achieve the greatest levels \r\nof agreement possible among the membership of \r\nthe Organization.\r\nOur proposal is inclusive, since it seeks to provide \r\nopportunities to all Member States and regions, \r\nparticularly those that are underrepresented in the \r\ncurrent configuration of the Security Council, such as \r\nAfrica. The UfC proposal even addresses the ambitions \r\nof some States that legitimately wish to take on greater \r\nresponsibility in the Security Council. In this context, I \r\nwould like to invite the General Assembly to reflect on \r\nthe following points, in the hope that they will also be \r\nuseful for the work to be carried out by the co-Chairs \r\nof the new session of intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nFirst, reforming the Security Council is a great \r\nresponsibility that must not be taken lightly, nor \r\napproached in a fragmented or partial manner. It is in \r\nour hands to improve the capabilities of the Council \r\nso that it functions according to the expectations of \r\ncontemporary international society. We must avoid \r\npreserving the status quo, but we must also avoid a \r\nmeaningless reform that satisfies individual political \r\naspirations, granting privileges in perpetuity to some \r\nStates based on simple short-term reasons and to the \r\ndetriment of the collective interest. That is the worst \r\npossible scenario, one we must not let play out.\r\nSecondly, a Security Council with more privileged \r\npermanent members contradicts democracy, equality \r\nand inclusion. Increasing the number of permanent \r\nmembers goes against the need to reform the Council to \r\nmake it more democratic, equal and efficient. We seek \r\ngreater inclusion in the Organization, more rotation \r\namong countries in decision-making — not more \r\nprivileges granted in perpetuity to selected States.\r\nThirdly, the reform of the Security Council must \r\nnot focus solely on expanding membership, but also \r\nseriously address the improvement of its working \r\nmethods, including the decision-making mechanisms \r\nsuch as the responsibility in the use of the veto. The \r\ncurrent international moment we are living as well as the \r\nhistorical record are full of reasons for the use of veto \r\nto be restricted or withdrawn altogether. The French-\r\nMexican initiative, complemented by the proposal \r\nof the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency \r\ngroup, also shows that most of the States Members of \r\nthe United Nations want a comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council so that it does not lose its relevance to \r\nthe international community.\r\nMr. Andrianarivelo-Razafy (Madagascar), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nFourthly, expanding the category of elected \r\nmembers — the non-permanent members — is the only \r\nissue on which all the regional groups and negotiators \r\nagree. We must focus comprehensively on this aspect \r\nof reform, in addition to the working methods that I \r\nmentioned earlier, rather than concentrating on or \r\neven trying to impose views on the issues that divide \r\nus. The proposal of the Uniting for Consensus group \r\nto create only new long-term non-permanent seats \r\nwith re-election should be a solution that satisfies the \r\nambitions of States seeking broader participation in the \r\nCouncil. This method is the only solution to reform, \r\nand not accepting that is to block progress.\r\nFifthly, we regret that some negotiating groups in \r\nthe previous session have, absurdly, called into question \r\ndemocracy and representativeness. The lack of progress \r\nin the negotiations process is very frustrating, but even \r\nmore disheartening is the notion that in order to move \r\nforward, we must set aside principles agreed on as the \r\nbasis for the reform of the Security Council.\r\nSixthly, the lack of agreement on the central \r\nelements on which the reform should be based is a core \r\nimpediment to beginning negotiations on a text imposed \r\nby a purported majority. Mexico will not support \r\nthe start of negotiations on a text that recommends \r\nprivileges in perpetuity for some States. We are sure \r\nthat the expertise and skill of the new co-Chairs will \r\nguide our work without losing sight of that guiding \r\nprinciple. I reiterate Mexico’s support for achieving \r\nthat end.\r\nMr. Beleffi (San Marino): First of all, I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor convening this annual debate on the reform of \r\nthe Security Council. San Marino aligns itself with \r\nthe statement made by Italy on behalf of the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group. I would now like to make some \r\nremarks in my national capacity.\r\nSan Marino welcomes the decision to appoint two \r\nco-Chairs for the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. I would like to congratulate \r\nthe Ambassadors of Georgia and the United Arab \r\nEmirates for assuming the important responsibility of \r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n16/29 17-37015\r\nbeing co-Chairs. The delegation of San Marino would \r\nlike to ensure them of its full cooperation in all aspects \r\nof the work of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nEven if wide divergences remain on critical \r\nissues, we, the Member States, agreed, in decision \r\n62/557, that credible Security Council reform requires \r\na comprehensive approach and that Member States \r\nmust drive the negotiations. It is now our collective \r\nresponsibility to move the process forward in order to \r\nfind new areas of convergence among Member States.\r\nI would like to briefly remind the Assembly of \r\nthe principles upon which, in our view, the reform \r\nof the Security Council should be based: democracy, \r\ntransparency, accountability and inclusiveness. Those \r\nprinciples should be integrated into any reform of \r\nthe United Nations, not only that of the Security \r\nCouncil. A representative body is democratic if its \r\nmembers are periodically elected. Regular and periodic \r\nelections are possible only by increasing the number \r\nof non-permanent seats. Regular and periodic elections \r\nwould also build a more accountable Security Council.\r\nSan Marino believes that we should work on the \r\nidea of a compromise solution if we want to achieve \r\na comprehensive reform of the Security Council that \r\ncan garner the broadest possible political acceptance \r\nby Member States. We now know quite well each \r\nother’s perspectives on the different aspects of reform. \r\nWe therefore have to show flexibility and a spirit of \r\ncompromise to build a credible process for Security \r\nCouncil reform.\r\nMr. Tiare (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): \r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the President for \r\nconvening this debate on agenda item 122, entitled \r\n“Question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\nmatters related to the Security Council”. The number \r\nof delegations that have already spoken or that have yet \r\nto take the f loor serves to underline the importance of \r\nthis topic.\r\nI join others in congratulating Mrs. Lana Zaki \r\nNusseibeh and Mr. Kaha Imnadze, Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of the United Arab Emirates and \r\nGeorgia, respectively, following their appointment \r\nas co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nWe hope that under their leadership we will achieve \r\ntangible results. To that end, I assure them of my \r\ndelegation’s support and full cooperation in carrying \r\nout their tasks. I also take this opportunity to convey \r\nto their predecessors, the Permanent Representatives of \r\nRomania and Tunisia, Mr. Ion Jinga and Mr. Mohamed \r\nKhaled Khiari, respectively, our gratitude for their \r\nwork during the seventy-first session.\r\nWith regard to this item, my delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Sierra Leone on behalf of the African \r\nUnion (see A/72/PV.41), which clearly outlined Africa’s \r\nstance on the issue. I would now like to make some \r\nobservations in my national capacity.\r\nThe question of Security Council reform has been \r\nconsidered annually by the General Assembly for a \r\ndecade, pursuant to decision 62/557, which outlined \r\nfive points around which the debate should take place.\r\nOn equitable representation in the Security Council \r\nand the increase in the number of its members, my \r\ndelegation wonders whether today we still need to \r\npersuade Member States of that necessity, as obvious it \r\nis, and because both regional groups and those created \r\nby individual Member States support the legitimate \r\ninitiative to adapt the main organ responsible for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security to new \r\ngeopolitical realities. The main body responsible for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nmust be more representative, more responsive, more \r\ndemocratic, more transparent and able to respond \r\neffectively and efficiently to contemporary challenges. \r\nAccordingly, African countries, so far underrepresented \r\nin the non-permanent member category, and the African \r\ncontinent, the only continent with no permanent seat, \r\nhave a role to play in that important body, which would \r\nundoubtedly contribute to righting the historic injustice \r\nagainst Africa and to better establishing the legitimacy \r\nof the Security Council.\r\nWith reference to previous negotiations, Burkina \r\nFaso already welcomed the fact that the majority of \r\nStates agree on the need to increase the number of \r\nmembers, with representation from Africa within \r\nthe Security Council in both categories. That would \r\nenable the continent to participate in decision-making, \r\nparticularly with regard to those affecting the African \r\ncontinent, given that nearly three quarters of the \r\nissues on the Security Council’s agenda relate to \r\nAfrican countries. Burkina Faso therefore reaffirms \r\nits commitment to the Common African Position \r\nenshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \r\nDeclaration, and renewed at the African Union Summit \r\nheld in Kigali in 2016.\r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 17/29\r\nWith regard to membership categories, my \r\ndelegation is in favour of maintaining both existing \r\ncategories, since reform will eventually lead to a \r\nbetter membership balance for both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent seats, while strictly respecting broader \r\ngeographical representation. My delegation also \r\nfavours a balanced enlargement of the two categories, in \r\naccordance with the African stance to which I referred.\r\nWith regard to the right to the veto, Burkina Faso \r\nof course aligns itself with Africa’s position — that new \r\nmember States should enjoy the same privileges and \r\nprerogatives as existing members, including the right of \r\nveto, if it is maintained, of course, and in the interests \r\nof fairness.\r\nWith regard to the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil, it should be noted that they are of paramount \r\nimportance, because they determine the effectiveness \r\nand efficiency of the Council, whose the primary \r\nresponsibility is to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity objectively, impartially and non-selectively. \r\nAlthough we recognize that efforts have been made to \r\nimprove the working methods of the Security Council, \r\nwe must acknowledge that much remains to be done.\r\nOn the relationship between the Security Council \r\nand the General Assembly, progress has been made, as \r\nevidenced by regular meetings between the President \r\nof the General Assembly and the rotating monthly \r\npresidency of the Security Council. However, the \r\nGeneral Assembly is the only deliberative body in \r\nwhich all Member States have an equal voice. It is \r\ntherefore fitting that it should be given special attention \r\nby the Security Council. For that reason, we agree with \r\nthe large majority of delegations that close cooperation \r\nand coordination between the two bodies is essential, \r\nin strict compliance with the prerogatives and tasks of \r\neach body and in accordance with the provisions of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. In the same vein, the \r\nSecurity Council needs to be more transparent in its \r\nrelations with the General Assembly.\r\nAfter more than 20 years of discussions and \r\n13 cycles of intergovernmental negotiations, no \r\ncomprehensive, satisfactory solution has emerged from \r\nthis major undertaking, even though all Member States \r\nagree on the principle of a more representative Security \r\nCouncil that is better adapted to contemporary realities \r\nand able to respond to crises more quickly. How much \r\nlonger should we wait? It is high time, as is felt by \r\nthe majority of Member States, to move towards text-\r\nbased negotiations, which is the only sure way to move \r\ntowards a consensus-based solution accepted by all \r\nMember States. My delegation therefore urges the new \r\nco-Chairs to consider the calls of the majority.\r\nTo that end, the documented progress made during \r\nthe sixty-ninth, seventieth and seventy-first sessions \r\namounted to language that could be used to draft \r\na resolution for Member States to then consider. In \r\nthat same vein, the existing points of consensus and \r\nconvergence among regional and other groups, because \r\nthey have already been presented, are assets that we \r\npossess which, if properly used, will certainly make \r\nit possible to make significant progress in considering \r\nthe issue.\r\nBurkina Faso believes that only balanced \r\nmultilateralism will guarantee success in addressing \r\nthe most serious contemporary problems. It therefore \r\ncalls on all parties to sincerely negotiate with the \r\nresolute will, mutual trust and good faith required to \r\nachieve a reformed Security Council that is able to meet \r\nthe expectations of States and peoples. The unanimous \r\ndemand for reform by all Member States confirms, if \r\nthat were still needed, a legitimate aspiration, because \r\nthe inaction of the United Nations when faced with such \r\na clear-cut situation cannot be convincingly justified.\r\nMr. Djani (Indonesia): Let me first thank the \r\nPresident for convening us here on a very important \r\ntopic. I congratulate both Ambassador Imnadze of \r\nGeorgia and Ambassador Nusseibeh of the United Arab \r\nEmirates on their appointment as the new co-Chairs \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform. We also express our gratitude to the \r\nprevious co-Chairs, Ambassador Ion Jinga of Romania \r\nand Ambassador Khiari of Tunisia, for their important \r\nstewardship and contributions.\r\nThe ability and credibility of the Council are \r\nbeing widely questioned. The Council’s current \r\nstructure, the use of the veto and, at times, its failure \r\nto address conflicts equally and to uphold international \r\nhumanitarian law, international human rights law and \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations are \r\namong the crucial challenges that it faces in fostering \r\ninternational peace. Indonesia calls for a comprehensive \r\nreform of the Council, one that will make it more \r\neffective, accountable, democratic and representative \r\nof the contemporary world’s realities and plurality.\r\nIndonesia, together with many other Member \r\nStates, has contributed actively to helping advance \r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n18/29 17-37015\r\nthe reform process in a results-oriented manner. We \r\nwill continue to play a positive role to that end, but \r\nthe countless reform debates leave us with little doubt \r\nthat overcoming differences on key issues, such as \r\ncategories and the representation of countries, will not \r\nbe easy. Concerned States make arguments according \r\nto their legitimate perspectives, which is of course their \r\nright. However, given the nature of current conflicts \r\nand their grave humanitarian toll, the world cannot \r\nafford to wait for the reform exercise to run its course, \r\nwhich has been long.\r\nThat is why Indonesia advocates for picking the \r\nlow-hanging fruit that can enable the Council to meet \r\nits responsibilities. We are pleased that an increasing \r\nnumber of countries are also emphasizing such an \r\napproach. As a practical measure to prevent inaction \r\nby the Council in the face of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity or war crimes, Indonesia supports initiatives \r\nthat seek to regulate the use of the veto. We hope that \r\nthere will be greater focus on that issue in the upcoming \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nFurthermore, Indonesia is open to the exploration \r\nof all proposals that embrace an intermediate approach \r\nwith regard to categories of members with the addition \r\nof a clear review mechanism. In our view, such an \r\napproach has the potential to garner the widest possible \r\npolitical acceptance and move things forward.\r\nWe firmly believe that today’s many complex and \r\nmultidimensional global challenges cannot be met unless \r\nthe various regional perspectives are also reflected \r\nin the Council’s decision-making. The concerns and \r\naspirations of the developing world and the majority \r\nof its citizens should be reflected adequately. Without \r\ndetailing our position on regional representation, which \r\nhas been presented on many occasions, we support the \r\naddition of at least four non-permanent seats each for \r\nAsia and Africa, along with additional seats for Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean as well.\r\nWe fully support the Secretary-General’s call for a \r\nsurge in political diplomacy and for a strong effort to \r\nset conflict prevention as an overarching priority for the \r\nUnited Nations. Indonesia also stresses the actualization \r\nof the deep interconnection between sustaining peace \r\nand the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nIn that regard, we underscore that the work to reform \r\nthe Security Council also needs to be linked to other \r\nreform processes, particularly General Assembly \r\nrevitalization, the alignment exercise facilitated by \r\nAustralia and Argentina to enhance synergy between \r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil so as to advance the 2030 Agenda, and the \r\nrestructuring of the peace and security architecture, as \r\nwell as other United Nations management reforms.\r\nWhile the Council must be reformed so that it can \r\nfulfil its responsibility under the Charter of the United \r\nNations, sustainable peace will have the greatest chance \r\nof occurring when all three pillars — namely peace and \r\nsecurity, development and human rights — work in \r\nunison and are supported firmly by everyone.\r\nReform should also mean that more work is done \r\non the working methods of the Security Council. Better \r\ncommunication and coordination are needed among all \r\nrelated bodies of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, including the organs of the Secretariat. We \r\nwould love to see better consultations with members, \r\nparticularly with the troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries (TCCs/PCCs), which put their young men \r\nand women in harm’s way. That is what we mean by \r\nconcrete contributions. I also believe that small and \r\nlarge Member States alike deserve to have a place in the \r\nSecurity Council based on their concrete contributions.\r\nBuilding on Indonesia’s track record of diplomacy, \r\nreconciliation and peaceful conflict resolution, and \r\nas one of the top 10 contributors of TCCs and PCCs \r\nin peacekeeping efforts, as well as a candidate for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nterm 2019-2020, Indonesia is keen to assist the Council \r\nin meeting its responsibilities. Indonesia is determined \r\nto play its role fully in helping the Council achieve its \r\nCharter aims and to facilitate global peace, embedded \r\nin a holistic, synergized and practical approach.\r\nI would also like to support the comment made \r\nby my colleague the Permanent Representative of San \r\nMarino on the need for all of us to be f lexible and to \r\nachieve consensus. Let us not dilly-dally while the \r\nworld awaits our action.\r\nMs. Argüello González (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We are grateful for the convening of this \r\nimportant meeting on the negotiating process regarding \r\nthe question of equitable representation in the Security \r\nCouncil, including increasing its membership. \r\nWe congratulate Ambassadors Kaha Imnadze of \r\nGeorgia and Lana Zaki Nusseibeh of the United Arab \r\nEmirates on their appointment as co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the topic before us. \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 19/29\r\nWe are confident that their leadership will maintain the \r\ndynamism and impetus that the negotiation requires.\r\nNicaragua aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, Ambassador Rhonda King, on behalf of \r\nthe L.69 group (see A/72/PV.41).\r\nAfter 72 years, the Organization has not managed \r\nto comply fully with the objectives set out in its \r\nCharter. Faced with that unfortunate situation, the \r\ncall for reinvention is an urgent one. To that end, we \r\nmust promote the indispensable transformations of the \r\nOrganization so that it can better serve the interests \r\nof humankind.\r\nWe wish to emphasize that, during his presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly in 2008, Father Miguel D’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, Nicaragua’s Minister of Peace and \r\nDignity, developed and fought for such a reinvention \r\nuntil the end, laying the foundations for the discussion \r\nof such transformations. It is imperative to carry out \r\nthe reform of the Security Council so as to ensure that \r\nits composition and function reflect the geopolitical \r\nand economic realities of the international community \r\nof the twenty-first century, for which the expansion \r\nin the membership categories, including permanent \r\nand non-permanent members of the Security Council, \r\nis essential.\r\nIt is urgent that the negotiations enter a more \r\ndynamic phase. It is urgent that a negotiating text be \r\nprepared so as to achieve the necessary convergences \r\nand proceed with reforms during the seventy-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We consider it vital to \r\nnegotiate on the basis of a text, so that we can carry out \r\nreal negotiations with sincere efforts by all interested \r\nparties. After many years of participation in the \r\nnegotiations, we are ready and prepared to negotiate. \r\nIt is time for concrete results. At least 180 States have \r\ndeclared their positions since 2009, and at least 164 of \r\nthem support negotiations based on a negotiating text. \r\nWe cannot ignore those numbers, hence the urgent need \r\nfor a basic draft text to help us achieve the required \r\nconvergences and proceed with the reforms.\r\nNicaragua will continue to support efforts to \r\nreform the Security Council. The vast majority of \r\nthe international community has underscored that \r\nthe status quo is not an option. We cannot continue \r\nto obstruct a final decision in the reform process. We \r\nhope that the leadership on the part of the co-Chairs \r\nwill be decisive in overcoming the labyrinth that has \r\nconsumed so many years. They can count on the full \r\ncollaboration of Nicaragua in their noble task. There \r\nis every need to have an open and in-depth reflection \r\nprocess aimed at the crucial transformation, reinvention \r\nand democratization of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Hilale (Morocco) (spoke in French): At \r\nthe outset, on behalf of my delegation, I would like \r\nto congratulate Mr. Kaha Imnadze and Ms. Lana \r\nNusseibeh, the Permanent Representatives of Georgia \r\nand the United Arab Emirates, respectively, on their \r\nappointment as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the question of equitable representation \r\non and increase in the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and other matters related to the Security \r\nCouncil. My delegation assures them of our full support \r\nas they carry out their work.\r\nWe would also like to commend the outstanding \r\nwork carried out by the previous co-Chairs, \r\nMr. Ion Jinga, Permanent Representative of Romania, \r\nand Mr. Mohamed Khiari, Permanent Representative \r\nof Tunisia. That work culminated in the drafting of a \r\ndiscussion paper that takes stock of the convergences \r\nand divergences in the positions of Member States on \r\nthe question of Security Council reform.\r\nMy delegation endorses the statements (see A/72/\r\nPV.41) made by the representative of Sierra Leone \r\non behalf of the Group of African States and by the \r\nrepresentative of Kuwait on behalf of the Group of \r\nArab States.\r\nDuring the General Assembly at its seventy-first \r\nsession, we witnessed an increasingly urgent call from \r\na large majority of delegations to continue negotiations \r\non Security Council reform. Nevertheless, in our view, \r\nit is crucial to prevent the process from being never-\r\nending. We must reach agreement on specific modalities \r\nwith a clear timetable for further work.\r\nWe agree that it is time for the international \r\ncommunity to ensure that the Security Council \r\ndemonstrates effectiveness, representativeness, \r\naccountability and transparency in its work, and that \r\nit is a Security Council that underscores its ability to \r\nreflect the concerns of all Member States. Everyone \r\nagrees that the reform of the Council should be \r\ncomprehensive and not gradual, and that it should take \r\ninto account the five key elements with no exceptions \r\nand without distinctions.\r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n20/29 17-37015\r\nThe way in which the Security Council currently \r\noperates has led to a situation where for years now \r\nseveral voices within the international community \r\nhave been calling for its revision and its improvement \r\nthrough a tangible expansion that would improve \r\nits transparency and effectiveness. We call for a \r\nSecurity Council that is more representative, but we \r\nbelieve that any expansion of the Council should not \r\nbe at the expense of its effectiveness, efficiency and \r\naccountability. For us, the expansion of the Council in \r\nboth categories is an absolute necessity. However, that \r\nis a thorny issue, one that must be carefully considered \r\nand managed.\r\nHowever, the injustice done to Africa in the \r\ndesign of the Security Council is apparent to us all. It \r\nmeans that we should address that without further ado. \r\nStrengthening Africa’s presence within the category of \r\nnon-permanent members and ensuring its representation \r\nin the permanent-member category would deliver justice \r\nto our continent and would provide a positive response \r\nto the request put forward, nearly unanimously, by the \r\nvast majority of Member States.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations designates the \r\nSecurity Council as the principal organ responsible for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nThat is a clear, unequivocal mandate with no ambiguity. \r\nAny support of the General Assembly in matters \r\npertaining to peace and security can be seen as positive \r\nonly if it is in line with the respective mandates of those \r\ntwo bodies.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my \r\ndelegation’s support to the two co-Chairs. I hope that \r\nduring this session the intergovernmental negotiation \r\nprocess — the real platform for dialogue and \r\nconstructive exchanges — will make it possible to iron \r\nout the points of divergence and reconcile the positions \r\nin order to ensure that the reform of the Council to \r\nwhich we aspire actually materializes.\r\nMr. Mažeiks (Latvia): I thank the President for \r\nconvening this annual debate on Security Council \r\nreform. Since the 2005 World Summit, the call for an \r\nearly reform of the Security Council has been made \r\nmany times, just as there have been many appeals to \r\nmake the Council more representative, efficient and \r\ntransparent in order to reflect the political realities of \r\nthe twenty-first century. Security Council reform is \r\nlong overdue, and we should all seek to strengthen the \r\nlegitimacy of that important body.\r\nThis is the tenth year of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. We note \r\nthat some progress was achieved during the past three \r\nsessions of the intergovernmental negotiations, each \r\nresulting in an outcome document that clarifies the \r\npositions of Member States regarding various aspects \r\nof Security Council reform. First, the 2015 framework \r\ndocument reflected the positions of more than half of \r\nthe Member States. A year later, the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations tried to formulate elements of convergence \r\ncovering certain aspects of the reform. At the latest such \r\nsession, the co-Chairs prepared a document entitled \r\n“Elements of commonality and issues for further \r\nconsideration on the question of equitable representation \r\nand increase in the membership in Security Council and \r\nrelated matters”. We appreciate the efforts of all former \r\nChairs of the intergovernmental negotiations to help to \r\ninform its work, just as we appreciate the support of the \r\nformer and current Presidents of the General Assembly \r\nto advance the reform.\r\nLatvia welcomes the decision of the General \r\nAssembly to appoint Ms. Lana Nusseibeh, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Arab Emirates, and \r\nMr. Kaha Imnadze, Permanent Representative of \r\nGeorgia, as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations at this session of the General Assembly. \r\nWe wish them success in that important task, and we \r\nare committed to working with them and with other \r\nMember States in order to facilitate real reform.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations have yet to \r\nproduce the concrete outcome of a true negotiation \r\nprocess. We believe that, rather than entering into \r\nyet another cycle of discussions and restating well-\r\nknown positions, the time is right to take the process \r\na step further and to start text-based negotiations on \r\nthe reform. While we believe that a wide majority of \r\nStates Members of the United Nations share that view, \r\nwe fully trust our distinguished co-Chairs to confirm \r\nsuch an assessment in a way that they find appropriate.\r\nWe do not expect the negotiations to be fast and \r\neasy. The result can be achieved only through careful \r\nconsensus-building and must receive the widest \r\npolitical acceptance. Latvia is ready to take part in \r\nsuch negotiations aimed at achieving long-awaited \r\nSecurity Council reform, which should be the goal of \r\nour deliberations.\r\nMoving on to specific aspects of the reform, in our \r\nview, all regions must be adequately represented in \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 21/29\r\nthe Council so as to ensure its legitimacy. The reform \r\nshould ensure equitable geographic distribution of both \r\npermanent and non-permanent seats in the Council, \r\nincluding the allocation of at least one additional \r\nnon-permanent seat to the Group of Eastern European \r\nStates. We also believe that during the nomination and \r\nelection of non-permanent members of the Council, due \r\nconsideration should be given to adequate representation \r\nof small and medium-sized Member States.\r\nThere is no doubt that the question of the veto \r\nrepresents a very important part of the reform. \r\nDiscussions on the use of that special power in certain \r\ncircumstances should be continued. Yet aspects of the \r\nproblem are by now beyond debate. Blocking the work \r\nof the Council in matters related to mass atrocities is \r\nunacceptable. Council members should refrain from \r\nusing their veto in situations of atrocity crimes. Latvia \r\nhas signed the code of conduct regarding Security \r\nCouncil action against genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes, and we are happy to see that \r\nmore than half of the United Nations membership has \r\ndone so as well.\r\nWe also support improving the Security Council’s \r\nworking methods so as to increase the transparency, \r\ninclusiveness and representativeness of its work. That \r\nwould enhance the Council’s legitimacy and facilitate \r\nthe implementation of its decisions.\r\nIn conclusion, Latvia believes that the United \r\nNations capacity to address the current global \r\nchallenges depends largely on the political will of \r\nMember States to move forward Security Council \r\nreform. That is long overdue, and we should all strive \r\nto strengthen the legitimacy of that important body. It is \r\ntime to move forward and achieve a concrete outcome \r\nin that process. We hope that the upcoming session \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations will achieve \r\nprogress in that regard.\r\nMs. Flores Herrera (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nFirst of all, I welcome the decision of the President \r\nof the General Assembly to convene today’s meeting \r\non agenda item 122, entitled “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership \r\nof the Security Council and other matters related \r\nto the Security Council”. The need to pursue the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the seventy-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly reflects, in no \r\nuncertain terms, the desire of more than 97 per cent of \r\nMember States.\r\nWe commend the President’s appointment of our \r\ncolleagues Mrs. Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Arab Emirates, and \r\nMr. Kaha Imnadze, Permanent Representative of \r\nGeorgia, to serve as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, which represents not only a good choice \r\nbut also demonstrates the commitment that the \r\nPresident has made to try to ensure gender quality in \r\ncarrying out his work. We wish the co-Chairs every \r\nsuccess in facilitating the process, which they will, we \r\nknow, skilfully carry out, and we assure them of our \r\nunyielding support and readiness to work constructively \r\nto achieve the goals ahead. Likewise, we acknowledge \r\nthe commendable work of Ambassadors Khiari and \r\nJinga as co-Chairs during the previous session.\r\nThe Security Council was born as the result of a \r\ncataclysm in the history of humankind — from the \r\nashes and the suffering of a World War. Despite the \r\nchanging nature of our world over the past 72 years, \r\nthe Council has been substantively overhauled only \r\nonce. Although the Security Council has succeeded \r\nin preventing another conflict of a global scale, we \r\nare witnessing today the proliferation of humanitarian \r\ncrises that also know no borders and present great \r\nchallenges to international peace and security, \r\nincluding the protracted and ongoing tragedy of \r\nrefugees, the threat of terrorism becoming the status \r\nquo, and constant challenges to the disarmament \r\nagenda in all its aspects. Those situations, which affect \r\nso many people, in particular the men, women and \r\nchildren whom, in keeping with the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, we made a commitment not \r\nto leave behind. That is more than enough reason to \r\ngive greater impetus to reforming the sole organ of the \r\nUnited Nations whose decisions are binding and strictly \r\nenforceable. The inertia of the Security Council in its \r\ndecision-making is measured in human lives every day, \r\nand the Organization cannot allow that.\r\nThe review of the composition of the Security \r\nCouncil and other related matters is an essential \r\ncomponent in efforts to revitalize the Organization and \r\nmake it more fit for purpose pursuant to the noble agenda \r\nthat we are already implementing. It is a fundamental \r\nissue that concerns the maintenance of peace and \r\ninternational security and is intrinsically linked to \r\nsustainable development. Panama believes that the \r\ntime has come for the reform of the Security Council \r\nto become an effective reality, thereby becoming the \r\nfourth pillar sustaining the comprehensive overhaul \r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n22/29 17-37015\r\nof the United Nations, in addition to the reform of the \r\ndevelopment system, which is the most advanced, the \r\nreform of the peace and security architecture and the \r\nreform of management, which we have entrusted to the \r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe Security Council needs to be revitalized not \r\nonly to reflect the world’s current composition, but \r\nalso in order for it to be effective, transparent and \r\naccountable to the international community. Most \r\nimportant, a successful reform would send a clear \r\nmessage that our common global interests supersede \r\nindividual national interests. By safeguarding the \r\ncredibility of the Security Council with regard to the \r\nresolution of conflicts, we will safeguard the continued \r\nrelevance of the multilateral system for the world. The \r\npractical implementation of the code of conduct on \r\nlimiting the use of the veto in the Security Council will \r\nbring us closer to reforming that body, because it will \r\nprogressively erase the distinctions between permanent \r\nand non-permanent, elected members.\r\nAs we have said before, Panama hopes to see a \r\nSecurity Council that in 2045, which will mark the \r\nUnited Nations centennial, will be composed of 26 \r\nmembers, all on equal standing, elected every three \r\nyears, with the possibility of consecutive re-elections. \r\nThe intended effect is to bring together various \r\npositions around the table, giving a greater voice to \r\nunderrepresented regions in the current composition of \r\nthe Council, such as Africa and small island developing \r\nStates. The intent is to dismantle the paradigm that we \r\nhave been discussing so that we can move forward. \r\nThe paradigm I am speaking of is one composed of \r\npermanent and non-permanent, elected members.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLet me repeat Panama’s vision in English so that it \r\nis absolutely clear. By the time of the United Nations \r\ncentennial in 2045, Panama envisions a Security Council \r\nconsisting of 26 members, all on equal standing, elected \r\nfor three-year terms, with the possibility of consecutive \r\nre-elections.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nOur proposal can be found on PaperSmart.\r\nDuring this session, let us use the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations to move beyond the status quo and come \r\nup with a text on the basis of which we can negotiate \r\ntowards achieving the much-desired reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. Let us move beyond the discussions \r\nthat we began more than 20 years ago about the urgent \r\nneed to reform the Council.\r\nFor its part, the delegation of Panama will continue \r\nto participate actively in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process on reforming the Security \r\nCouncil, in keeping with our mission to build bridges, \r\nwhile trying to bring together those with positions \r\nthat are clearly polarized. We believe that there are \r\nmore elements that unite us than divide us. That is our \r\ncommitment to “We the People” — “We, the peoples of \r\nthe world” — to whom we are duty-bound.\r\nMr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): Let me begin by \r\nexpressing our full support for the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session, and \r\nthe way forward that he has presented for the ongoing \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. I would like also to join \r\nothers in congratulating the Permanent Representatives \r\nof Georgia and the United Arab Emirates on their \r\nappointment as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, and in wishing them every success in moving \r\nforward the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nDuring the previous session of the General \r\nAssembly, we achieved considerable progress in our \r\ndeliberations on Security Council reform, as reflected \r\nin the food-for-thought paper prepared by the previous \r\nco-Chairs, which includes commonalities and issues \r\nfor further consideration. We share the view that \r\ncontinuing our discussions in such a constructive and \r\ncoherent way will help in our efforts to achieve long-\r\nawaited progress in Security Council reform.\r\nMy delegation is ready to discuss all the proposals \r\nalready put forward by delegations during previous \r\nrounds of negotiations, so that we can identify those that \r\nmight receive major support in the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council. The General Assembly \r\nunanimously adopted decision 62/557, calling on us, in \r\nour work on the Security Council reform, to build upon \r\nthe discussions held during previous General Assembly \r\nsessions, including proposals and positions reflected in \r\nthe framework document circulated on 31 July 2015. In \r\nthat regard, we believe that there is already a solid basis \r\nfor beginning text-based negotiations in order to arrive \r\nat a shorter, more precise framework document as the \r\nmost immediate outcome of our deliberations.\r\nI will not go into all the details of our position, \r\nsince it is well known and duly reflected in the \r\nframework document. Yet, as a current elected \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 23/29\r\nmember of the Security Council and as a country that \r\nhas experienced at first hand the shortcomings of \r\nthe Council’s existing working methods and format, \r\nwhich directly influence its record in safeguarding \r\ninternational peace and security, Ukraine deems it \r\nnecessary to reiterate our position on several important \r\naspects of Council reform.\r\nFirst, increasing the representative character of \r\nthe Security Council is one of the top priorities. Yet \r\nit should not be an obstacle to, or in any way delay, \r\nreaching agreement on other areas of the Council’s \r\nreform or the practical implementation of such reform.\r\nSecondly, we strongly believe that any formula \r\nfor the Council’s enlargement should include the \r\nprovision of an additional non-permanent seat for the \r\nGroup of Eastern European States, whose membership \r\nhas more than doubled in size in the past decades. We \r\nare encouraged that, during our intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation discussions, several groups of States, \r\nnot only the Eastern European Group, have clearly \r\nexpressed their support for that approach. We are \r\ntherefore of the view that the addition of one more \r\nnon-permanent seat for the Eastern European Group in \r\nan expanded Council should be considered as one of the \r\ncommonalities as far as regional representation goes.\r\nWe also support the idea that equitable \r\ngeographical distribution should be reflected in an \r\nexpanded Council’s membership. My delegation is \r\nconvinced that any change in the Security Council’s \r\ncomposition should be based on the existing regional \r\ngroups of Member States. At the same time, we think \r\nthat there is merit in exploring the option of allocating \r\na non-permanent seat in the future Council to the small \r\nisland developing States.\r\nThirdly, on the basis of our own current \r\nmembership of the Security Council, we know how \r\nimperative it is that elected members be able to play \r\na more active and effective role in the proceedings \r\nand the decision-making process of the Council. In \r\norder to enhance the transparency, accountability and \r\ninclusiveness of the Council’s work, and with a view to \r\nstrengthening its effectiveness, my delegation considers \r\nit equally necessary to hold broader consultations and \r\nother forms of interaction with non-Council members \r\non a regular basis.\r\nThe Council should also meet, as a general rule, \r\nin a public format and hold frequent, timely and \r\nsubstantive open briefings on the matters discussed \r\nin the Security Council and in its subsidiary organs in \r\nprivate meetings. In that regard, we welcome the so-\r\ncalled wrap-up sessions of the Council, of which there \r\nhave been very few, one of which was held this year \r\nunder Ukraine’s presidency (see S/PV.8038). At the \r\nsame time, we also consider appropriate other public \r\nformats of the Council’s meetings, such as the Arria \r\nFormula, which provides an opportunity for Council \r\nmembers to discuss issues of the utmost importance \r\nnot only with concerned Governments but also with \r\nthe broader United Nations membership, as well as \r\nkey civil-society actors. All those and many other \r\nimportant procedural matters were reflected in the \r\nrecently adopted revised note prepared by the President \r\nof the Security Council in document S/2017/507. That \r\ndecision should now be properly implemented in the \r\nCouncil’s daily practice.\r\nI cannot but stress that, for my country, the need for \r\nSecurity Council reform is as high now as ever before. \r\nThe continued unlawful and aggressive actions of the \r\nRussian Federation in Ukraine, leading to the loss of \r\nthousands of lives, have placed into question not only \r\nthe security of my country but also that of all of Europe. \r\nThe subsequent inability of the Security Council to \r\nreact promptly to that aggression because of the use of \r\nthe right to the veto severely undermines the credibility \r\nof the Council and condones the very aggression that \r\nthe Council was established to rule out.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to reiterate our firm \r\nposition on the need to phase out the right to the veto \r\nas a major obstacle to the Council’s ability to act \r\neffectively in response to challenges to international \r\npeace and security. As one of the signatories to the \r\nFrench-Mexican declaration on the restriction of the \r\nveto power, as well as the related code of conduct, we \r\nbelieve that, while abolishing the veto is a long-term \r\nobjective, all members of the Council — permanent \r\nand elected alike — must voluntarily pledge not to vote \r\nagainst draft resolutions in cases of mass atrocities, \r\ngenocide and crimes against humanity. The same \r\napproach should be implemented in cases of war crimes \r\nand foreign aggression. That is why it is important, \r\nin the course of the Council’s reform, to envisage the \r\nresponsibility of a party to a conflict to abstain from \r\nvoting on a Council decision concerning the resolution \r\nof that conflict.\r\nFinally, let me assure the President and the \r\nco-Chairs of my delegation’s full support for their \r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n24/29 17-37015\r\nchallenging assignment to steer the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process.\r\nMr. Al-khalifa (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\ndelegation of Qatar would like to thank the President \r\nfor having convened this meeting. We express our \r\nappreciation for the commendable efforts of the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Tunisia and Romania, \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations during \r\nthe seventy-first session of the General Assembly. \r\nWe would also like to congratulate the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Arab Emirates and the \r\nPermanent Representative of Georgia as co-Chairs \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations during the \r\ncurrent session.\r\nWe align ourselves with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Group of Arab States (see A/72/\r\nPV.41).\r\nThe international community places great hopes \r\non the reform of the Security Council, because the \r\nCouncil is the primary organ within the United Nations \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security and the only organ within the \r\nUnited Nations that has the authority to adopt binding \r\nresolutions and take collective enforcement measures \r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations. More than 20 \r\nyears after the start of discussions on the reform of the \r\nCouncil, and after the submission of many proposals \r\nand initiatives, despite the difficulties and the obstacles \r\nencountered in that process Council reform continues \r\nto be a priority for Member States. Success in the \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations hinges on \r\nthe reform of the Security Council as one of the pillars \r\nof the United Nations. The delay in that reform calls \r\nfor greater cooperation among the groups and countries \r\ninterested in reform and involves rethinking in order \r\nto accelerate negotiations so that we can agree on a \r\nnumber of proposals that would render the new Council \r\nmore effective in implementing its mandate to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe State of Qatar is committed to the common \r\nresponsibility of States to reach international consensus \r\non issues of interest to the international community \r\nand to provide an opportunity for an informal dialogue \r\nthat would move forward the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. To that end, \r\nin January, my country hosted the Doha retreat on the \r\nreform of the Security Council, in which geographical \r\ngroups and interested countries took part. The Doha \r\ntalks reaffirmed that the reform of the Security Council \r\nis not the responsibility of specific groups of countries \r\nbut that of the entire international community.\r\nThe State of Qatar underscores the interlinkages \r\namong all aspects of the negotiations. There are also \r\nelements of commonality pursuant to decision 62/557, \r\nwhich was adopted by consensus. Any attempt to reform \r\nthe Security Council will therefore not be successful if \r\nit is limited to one aspect and ignores the other aspects.\r\nWe therefore reiterate that the issue of the right \r\nto the veto is a crucial element in the reform of the \r\nCouncil. Experience has shown that it is important \r\nthat the use of the veto should be limited and that \r\nStates should refrain from using it in cases of mass \r\natrocities, war crimes, genocide or ethnic cleansing. \r\nThe arbitrary use of the veto has in many cases \r\nundermined the credibility of decision-making within \r\nthe Security Council. It has also led to the inability \r\nof the Security Council to assume its responsibilities \r\nand take measures to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. In that respect, we reiterate our support for \r\nthe Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group \r\nand the French-Mexican initiative on restraint in the \r\nuse of the veto in atrocity situations. Those initiatives \r\nhave been endorsed by more than 120 States, including \r\nthe State of Qatar.\r\nThere is another issue of interest to the State of \r\nQatar, namely, the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil, which we believe should receive more \r\nattention in negotiations. Limiting ourselves to \r\npiecemeal approaches in addressing the working \r\nmethods of the Council undermines important \r\nnegotiations. The Council’s working methods must be \r\nreviewed and adapted to be in line with international \r\nlaw and the Charter of the United Nations. All States \r\nmust participate in formal and informal meetings of the \r\ninternational community. Periodic analytical reports \r\nshould be submitted by the Council to the General \r\nAssembly, and there must be sufficient coordination \r\namong the Security Council, the General Assembly \r\nand other United Nations organs. Furthermore, the \r\nprerogatives of other organs of the United Nations \r\nshould not be encroached upon.\r\nIn conclusion, the State of Qatar will continue \r\ncooperating and working with Member States to \r\nconstructively and openly address all proposals and \r\nideas arising in the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess aimed at making the Council more effective \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 25/29\r\nand accountable and able to take timely decisions in \r\norder to maintain international peace and security.\r\nMr. Nurudeen (Nigeria): At the outset, let me thank \r\nthe President and the Secretariat for convening today’s \r\nplenary meeting on agenda item 122, which again \r\nprovides us with an opportunity to share perspectives \r\non the question of equitable representation and an \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand other matters related to the Security Council. I \r\nalso thank the President for his insightful introductory \r\nremarks on this crucial issue (see A/72/PV.41).\r\nThe Nigerian delegation welcomes the President’s \r\ndecision to appoint Ambassadors Kaha Imnadze and \r\nLana Zaki Nusseibeh, Permanent Representatives of \r\nGeorgia and the United Arab Emirates, respectively, \r\nas co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations at \r\nthe current session. We assure the co-Chairs of our full \r\nsupport and wish them great success in their efforts to \r\nmove the reform process forward. We also commend \r\nthe outgoing co-Chairs, Ambassador Mohamed \r\nKhaled Khiari of Tunisia and Ambassador Ion Jinga of \r\nRomania, under whose watch significant successes were \r\nrecorded during the seventy-first session of the General \r\nAssembly. We admire the great skill with which they \r\nsteered the intergovernmental negotiations process.\r\nI wish to reiterate the fact that Nigeria aligns itself \r\nwith the statements delivered by the Chairs of the Group \r\nof African States and the L.69 group, respectively (see \r\nA/72/PV.41). Let me, however, make a few remarks in \r\nmy national capacity.\r\nDuring the more than seven decades since the \r\ninception of the United Nations, the world has undergone \r\ntremendous change, ranging from population increase, \r\neconomic growth and technological advancement, \r\namong other things. During that period, new challenges \r\nhave also emerged posing threats to international peace \r\nand security on a scale that has never been witnessed \r\nbefore. The imperative of the new challenges strongly \r\nindicates that the current structure of the Security \r\nCouncil must be reformed in order to reposition \r\nit so as better to respond to issues in a timely and \r\nappropriate manner.\r\nA reform of the Council would entail a \r\nrestructuring and expansion of its membership to take \r\naccount of, inter alia, the increased membership of \r\nthe Organization and the need to reflect the interests \r\nof all the constituent regions. To our delight, previous \r\nsessions of the intergovernmental negotiations have \r\nshown the emergence of broad consensus on the need for \r\nexpansion of the membership of the Security Council in \r\nboth the permanent and the non-permanent categories. \r\nNigeria acknowledges the work already done at previous \r\nsessions and looks forward to working concertedly \r\nwith all concerned to build on the gains made thus far. \r\nWe appreciate the contributions of a large number of \r\nStates whose proposals are contained in the framework \r\ndocument on the subject and, given their quality, we are \r\nconvinced that it is high time to commence text-based \r\nnegotiations on this critical matter.\r\nWe are aware of the challenges that we face in \r\nguiding and moving the reform process forward. Given \r\nthe difficulties experienced in bridging the differences \r\nin the varied positions and in working out the modus \r\noperandi for advancing the process, we urge Member \r\nStates to continue to seek ways of fulfilling the political \r\ncommitment that our leaders made at the 2005 World \r\nSummit, at which time Heads of State and Government \r\nagreed on the imperative need for early reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nNigeria and other emerging nations continue to \r\ndemonstrate the capacity to add value to the work of \r\nall the organs of the United Nations, including the \r\nSecurity Council. For that reason, we must now commit \r\nourselves to accelerating the long-overdue reforms of \r\nthe Council. They will no doubt make the Council more \r\nequitable, more inclusive, efficient, transparent and \r\nmore effective. Nigeria believes that a reformed Security \r\nCouncil with expanded permanent membership would \r\nbenefit from the unique experiences and capacities that \r\nregional representatives could bring to bear on its work.\r\nNigeria has always expressed its support for the \r\nadvancement of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess in an open, inclusive and transparent manner. As \r\nwe prepare to move into the next round of negotiations \r\nduring this session, we thank all delegations that have \r\ncontinued to express their support for the Common \r\nAfrican Position. We would like to take this opportunity \r\nto reaffirm that African Union position on the entire \r\nsubject of Security Council reform, to which we adhere \r\nvery strongly. That proposal is important, as it seeks, \r\ninter alia, to correct the historical injustice done to \r\nthe continent and its continued marginalization over \r\nso many years. For that reason, we wish to underscore \r\nthe overriding need to ensure that the interests of \r\nAfrica continue to be advanced and safeguarded. \r\nAfrican States have offered a coherent, practical and \r\npersuasive blueprint for the Council’s reform. We have \r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n26/29 17-37015\r\ncome up with our Common Position, which asserts \r\nthe right of our continent, which has for so long been \r\nmarginalized, to be fully represented in the Council, \r\njust we recognize the legitimate aspirations of other \r\nregions to be represented.\r\nSecurity Council reform is inspired by the principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations itself. The clear \r\nobjective of that process is based on the sovereign \r\nequality of all Member States and on the need to adhere \r\nto the principles of democratization and inclusiveness \r\nin the United Nations. It is undoubtedly a worthwhile \r\nprocess. We must therefore muster the desired will that \r\ncan lead to the achievement of a reformed Security \r\nCouncil sooner rather than delaying it indefinitely. Be \r\nassured that my delegation will actively participate in \r\nall of the processes relating to Security Council reform. \r\nIn doing so, it is important to stress that all outcomes \r\nshould encompass and take on board the views and \r\ninterests of all Member States.\r\nFinally, what is required of us at this juncture \r\nis to move the process forward through text-based \r\nnegotiations. There should be noticeable progress in \r\nthe forthcoming negotiations, far beyond what we \r\nachieved during the seventy-first session. The demand \r\nis legitimate and credible and made with a full sense of \r\nresponsibility and relevance to the international system, \r\nand it deserves the full support of all Member States. \r\nWe look forward with great optimism to the next stage \r\nof action during the seventy-second session. We assure \r\nthe President of our full cooperation in that respect.\r\nMrs. Pobee (Ghana): I join other delegations \r\nin expressing appreciation to the President for his \r\nleadership in the matter before us today and for the \r\nopportunity to continue the important debate on Security \r\nCouncil reform, which has engaged the attention of \r\nthe United Nations for almost 25 years. During the \r\nhigh-level general debate of the General Assembly in \r\nSeptember, the issue of equitable representation in, \r\nand the enlargement of, Security Council membership \r\nwas raised by several delegations, including the \r\ndelegation of Ghana, thereby reaffirming the need for \r\ninclusive reforms that would reflect the universal and \r\nrepresentative character of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the Permanent Representative of Sierra \r\nLeone on behalf of the Group of African States (see \r\nA/72/PV.41). I shall now make the following remarks in \r\nmy national capacity.\r\nAt the outset, we wish to emphasize the central role \r\nplayed by the General Assembly in this question, and \r\nwe welcome our continued deliberation on this item \r\nin the General Assembly at the current session. We \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Kaha Imnadze, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Georgia, and Ambassador Lana \r\nNusseibeh, Permanent Representative of the United \r\nArab Emirates, on their appointment as co-Chairs of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. We assure them of Ghana’s active engagement \r\nand support in the course of this session.\r\nGhana, like many other delegations, attaches great \r\nimportance to the issue of equitable representation on \r\nthe Security Council, and over the years it has called for \r\nthe enlargement of the Council’s membership, in line \r\nwith the African Common Position as contained in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus. We are committed to efforts to \r\nmake the Council, a vital organ of the United Nations, \r\nmore broadly representative, efficient and transparent \r\nso that we can enhance its effectiveness and legitimacy \r\nin the implementation of its decisions.\r\nIt is more evident now than ever, 72 years after the \r\nfounding of the Organization, that broader political \r\nspace is required within the Security Council so as to \r\nenable it to address today’s challenges and fulfil its \r\nmandate. Our loud call in the General Assembly for \r\nthe reform of the Security Council is well-grounded in \r\nthe changing global landscape and in the face of the \r\ndramatic changes in the nature, scale and complexity of \r\nthreats to international peace and security. The inability \r\nand apparent lack of political will in the Security \r\nCouncil to provide effective leadership in addressing \r\nsome of the most urgent and dire threats to global \r\nsecurity make it imperative for us to intensify efforts to \r\nimprove the structure and functioning of that important \r\nbody. Ghana believes that, if we continue to allow our \r\ncurrent differences to stall progress on Council reform, \r\nit will be to the detriment of the Organization and the \r\nbillions of people we represent.\r\nWith its 54 Member States, Africa accounts for \r\nclose to one third of the membership of the United \r\nNations and 70 per cent of the Council’s work. Many \r\nAfrican countries, including Ghana, contribute troops \r\nto international peacekeeping, not only on the continent \r\nbut also in other regions around the globe. In that context, \r\nsome of our peacekeepers continue to pay the ultimate \r\nprice with their lives in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. It is inconceivable, therefore, that \r\nin the scheme of things today, Africa has only three \r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 27/29\r\nseats in the non-permanent category, and no permanent \r\nseat. Africa’s demand for at least two permanent seats \r\nand two additional non-permanent seats is a matter of \r\naddressing the historical injustice done at the founding \r\nof the Organization, and of ensuring the right to an equal \r\nsay in decision-making on issues of international peace \r\nand security, as well as in modernizing and improving \r\nglobal governance. The same principle should apply to \r\nother underrepresented regions.\r\nAs we all know, multilateralism seeks to ensure \r\ncollective security and inclusion. In our view, continued, \r\nsubstantive and enhanced engagement on the part of all \r\nis necessary if we wish to improve prospects for early \r\nreform. We as Member States must continue to work \r\ntogether, even if we differ in views, in order to move \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiation process forward. \r\nGhana therefore welcomes the elements of convergence \r\nthat were identified during the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-first session, and commends Ambassador \r\nIon Jinga, Permanent Representative of Romania, \r\nand Ambassador Mohamed Khiari, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Tunisia, for their tremendous efforts \r\nin that regard.\r\nWe believe that there is general acceptance of the \r\nneed to enlarge the Council membership so as to make \r\nit more representative and to include more developing \r\ncountries. Progress on other reform issues, such as \r\nmembership categories, the question of the veto, \r\nregional representation, the size of the enlarged Council \r\nand Council working methods, may be complex but \r\ndo not represent an insurmountable challenge. With \r\nabundant f lexibility, goodwill and compromise we can \r\nreach our goal of Security Council reform. We believe \r\nthat the emerging consensus on various aspects of the \r\nreforms must be followed through, and efforts should \r\nbe made to advance the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nto text-based negotiations.\r\nWith regard to the question of the veto and \r\nits impact on the work of an enlarged Council, we \r\nwould need to critically address that aspect of reform \r\nagainst the background of the current impact on the \r\nCouncil’s effective functioning. In the interim, Ghana \r\ncontinues to support the code of conduct proposed \r\nby the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency \r\ngroup aimed at preventing veto use in cases of mass-\r\natrocity crimes.\r\nWe also welcome the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral aimed at restructuring the United Nations \r\npeace and security architecture. We hope that when \r\nthose reform proposals are eventually finalized and \r\nimplemented, the Organization will be better positioned \r\nto coordinate and seamlessly carry out its mandate with \r\na reformed, democratic and representative Security \r\nCouncil working for a secure and peaceful world.\r\nMr. Hickey (United Kingdom): I thank Ambassador \r\nImnadze of Georgia and Ambassador Nusseibeh of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates for taking on the leadership \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform.\r\nThe United Kingdom is a long-standing and firm \r\nsupporter of the need for reform of the Security Council. \r\nWhen the first meeting of the Security Council was \r\nhosted in London, in 1946, there were 11 members. \r\nThat membership increased to its current 15 in 1965. \r\nIn the intervening years, the United Nations has grown \r\nand the world has changed. But the Security Council \r\nhas failed to keep pace with that change. It is right and \r\nfair that the world’s principal organ for the maintenance \r\nof peace and security should be representative of the \r\nworld that it seeks to protect. The United Kingdom \r\ntherefore continues to strongly welcome all efforts to \r\nmove the debate on Council reform forward.\r\nWhen we consider Security Council reform, we must \r\nbe mindful of the need to ensure that its effectiveness \r\nis never compromised — too great an increase in size \r\nrisks a cumbersome and slow decision-making process, \r\nthereby undermining the Council’s ability to respond \r\nappropriately and quickly to issues of international \r\npeace and security. With so many challenges before us, \r\nthat is a risk we cannot take.\r\nBy the same token, we cannot allow the issue of \r\nthe veto to slow our progress on the expansion of the \r\nCouncil. As my Prime Minister made clear in this Hall \r\nin September (see A/72/PV.8), we are proud to have \r\nused the full weight of our diplomacy to ensure that \r\nwe have not had to exercise our veto in a generation. \r\nWe are also proud signatories of the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency group’s code of conduct, \r\nand we are committed to never voting against a credible \r\ndraft resolution on preventing or ending a mass atrocity. \r\nSadly, we have seen others wield their veto through \r\nnarrow self-interest, to the significant detriment of \r\nthe Council’s reputation and, indeed, its responsibility \r\nto those who so desperately need our help. On Syria, \r\nsuch a use of the veto has prevented action against a \r\nA/72/PV.42 07/11/2017\r\n28/29 17-37015\r\ndespicable regime that has murdered its own people \r\nwith chemical weapons.\r\nFor those reasons, we believe that a modest \r\nexpansion in the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories — an increase that balances representation \r\nwith effectiveness — is the approach that we should \r\ncollectively pursue. Members will be aware of our \r\nsupport for permanent seats for Brazil, Germany, India \r\nand Japan, alongside permanent African representation. \r\nThat support is steadfast, and we look forward to \r\nworking through all available avenues in order to reach \r\na more representative and effective Security Council.\r\nMr. Filimonov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We thank the President for convening today’s \r\nmeeting. The issue of the reform of the Security Council \r\nis one of the most important issues on the agenda of \r\nthe global Organization, since it is the organ that, in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nbears the primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWe trust that the work of the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Georgia and the United Arab \r\nEmirates, as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, will be based on the principles of neutrality \r\nand will consider the entire gamut of positions of Member \r\nStates. We thank the representatives of Romania and \r\nTunisia for their work as co-Chairs during the previous \r\nsession of the General Assembly. They performed their \r\nduties in a competent and responsible manner.\r\nToday’s meeting kicks off the start of discussions on \r\nthe reform of the Security Council during the seventy-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly. Discussions \r\non the issue have been ongoing for many years and are \r\ncomplex in nature. To date, there have been 13 rounds \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations. Member States have \r\nmade some slight progress towards reform; However, \r\na universal solution that is able to satisfy the majority \r\nhas not yet been achieved. The approaches of the main \r\nplayers in the reform issue still differ significantly, \r\nand are sometimes diametrically opposed. In such \r\ncircumstances, we do not see any alternative but to \r\ncontinue the painstaking step-by-step work on the \r\nrapprochement of negotiating positions during the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly.\r\nOur stance on the matter is well known. Russia, \r\nas a permanent member of the Security Council, notes \r\nthe need to make the body more representative, first \r\nand foremost by including developing countries from \r\nAsia, Africa and Latin America. However, efforts in \r\nthat direction must not be allowed to affect the ability \r\nof the Council to respond effectively and promptly to \r\nemerging challenges. In that context, we are in favour \r\nof maintaining the compact nature of the composition \r\nof the Security Council — its membership should not \r\nexceed the low twenties.\r\nAny ideas that would lead to the infringement of \r\nthe prerogatives of the current permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council, including the institution of the \r\nveto, are unacceptable to us. We must remember that \r\nthis institution plays a key role in prompting members \r\nof the Council to seek balanced solutions. It would be \r\nwrong, both from a historical and a political point of \r\nview, to encroach on it.\r\nThe process of reforming the Security Council \r\nmust be owned by all States without exception, and its \r\nultimate composition should enjoy the widest possible \r\nsupport of Members of the Organization. If consensus \r\ncannot be reached on this issue, at least politically \r\nspeaking, we should ensure the support of a significant \r\nnumber of Member States, more than the legally \r\nrequired two-thirds majority of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are convinced that the issue of reform of \r\nthe Security Council cannot be resolved solely by \r\narithmetic by putting any models to the vote in order \r\nto obtain the minimum number of votes necessary. A \r\nresult achieved in that way would hardly enhance the \r\nprestige and effectiveness of the Security Council, \r\nand would certainly not serve to strengthen the global \r\nOrganization; rather, it would achieve the contrary. \r\nWe are ready to consider any reasonable option for \r\nexpanding the membership of the Security Council, \r\nincluding an interim solution or one of compromise, \r\nif it were based on broad consensus within the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nProgress in reforming the Security Council cannot \r\nbe achieved through the preparation of any texts, \r\nnegotiating documents or other initiatives that do not \r\nenjoy consensus among all Member States. Previous \r\nsessions of the General Assembly are a testament to \r\nthe futility and danger of trying to force through a \r\nsolution to the reform issue while ignoring consensus. \r\nProgress in Security Council reform will depend upon \r\nthe political will of Member States alone and their \r\nwillingness to reach a reasonable compromise. We urge \r\nall members to follow that fundamental principle.\r\n07/11/2017 A/72/PV.42\r\n17-37015 29/29\r\nWe trust that the efforts of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly and the co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations will focus on providing \r\nthe maximum assistance to the negotiations, on the \r\nunderstanding that ownership of the process lies with \r\nMember States. Such painstaking work should be \r\nconducted in a calm, transparent and inclusive manner, \r\nwithout arbitray time frames. We must all understand \r\nthat there is no place for arbitrary timelines regarding \r\nthis issue, and no place for attempts to solve it with a \r\nstroke of a pen.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n"
