"United Nations A/72/PV.43\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n43rd plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 8 November 2017, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 122 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand other matters related to the Security Council\r\nMr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand related matters is one of the most important \r\nagenda items, which must be considered very carefully \r\nin order for the solution ultimately achieved to lend \r\nclear legitimacy, effectiveness and transparency to the \r\nSecurity Council’s work. We seek reform that enables the \r\nCouncil to deal with challenges to peace and security in \r\na timely way while, at the same time, preventing those \r\nchanges that could obstruct or slow down its working \r\nmethods. The recent selection process and appointment \r\nof the Secretary-General and the increase in the number \r\nof open meetings in the Council’s work make it more \r\nimportant than ever to ensure those objectives.\r\nOn the question of the categories of membership \r\nof the Council, we underscore the need to increase \r\nboth categories of members — permanent and \r\nnon-permanent — in order for the Council to become \r\na truly representative body that reflects the new \r\ngeopolitical realities and responds appropriately to the \r\nsituations on its agenda. In turn, we acknowledge the \r\nprogress made since the most recent reform of that body.\r\nHowever, I reiterate that an increase in the permanent \r\nmembership does not under any circumstances mean \r\nan expansion of the right to the veto. In this regard, \r\nwe reaffirm our commitment to the code of conduct \r\non limiting the use of the veto, proposed by the \r\nAccountability, Coherence and Transparency group, \r\nof which we are a member, and to the French-Mexican \r\ndeclaration, which is supported by the permanent five. \r\nWe call on those States that have not yet done so to join \r\nthose initiatives.\r\nThe document on elements of convergence resulting \r\nfrom the intergovernmental negotiations in the context \r\nof the seventy-first session (decision 71/553), in which \r\nChile participated, provided guidance on how to move \r\nforward with text-based negotiations, which will require \r\ngreater f lexibility and openness by Member States.\r\nIn that regard, we appreciate the work carried \r\nout by the Permanent Representatives of Romania \r\nand Tunisia, Ambassadors Ion Jinga and Mohamed \r\nKhaled Khiari, respectively, as co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the previous \r\nsession. We wish their successors — the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Georgia and the United Arab \r\nEmirates, Ambassadors Kaha Imnadze and Lana Zaki \r\nNusseibeh, respectively — success in seeking to bring \r\ntogether positions in pursuit of a negotiating text that \r\nincludes the jointly agreed elements.\r\nMs. French (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States looks forward to another round of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. I would like to welcome our new co-Chairs, \r\nAmbassadors Nusseibeh and Imnadze, to whom \r\nwe will look for guidance on and oversight of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Their leadership on \r\nthe food-for-thought paper on Security Council reform \r\npositions captured our joint efforts towards convergence. \r\nEndeavouring to identify areas where the viewpoints of \r\ndelegations may be moving closer together is a logical \r\nstep towards broad consensus, which is a crucial \r\nelement in our reform efforts. We also thank our fellow \r\nMember States for contributing to the document, which \r\nserves as a helpful overview of the status of discussions \r\nwithin the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nWe know that many Member States believe the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process has debated the \r\nissue of United Nations reform for far too long and had \r\nlittle to show for it, and that only through text-based \r\nnegotiations can we achieve substantial progress. We \r\nrecognize that there are differences of opinion with \r\nregard to how we should conduct these negotiations \r\nand as to what text should provide the basis for \r\ndiscussion. The United States remains open to all \r\nmanner of negotiations within the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations framework, so long as they help us arrive \r\nat the broad consensus necessary to reach agreement on \r\nCouncil reform. Whatever path the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations follows, we must ensure that it enhances \r\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the Security Council \r\nand allows us to more effectively address pressing \r\nchallenges to international peace and security.\r\nFor reform to be successful, our decisions must \r\nenjoy the broadest possible consensus. In order to \r\nachieve this, the United States will support reasonable \r\nproposals for a modest expansion of the Council in \r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories. \r\nConsideration of any new permanent membership must \r\ntake into account candidates’ ability and willingness to \r\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, and to exercise the heavy responsibilities that \r\ncome with Security Council membership. We remain \r\nopposed to any expansion or alteration of the veto.\r\nThe President of the General Assembly and the \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations have \r\nthe support of the United States as we once again work \r\ntowards a comprehensive solution that can secure the \r\nbroadest Member State support.\r\nMr. Radomski (Poland): Let me thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening this important \r\nannual debate.\r\nAt the outset, Poland would like to warmly welcome \r\nthe nomination of Ambassador Lana Zaki Nusseibeh \r\nof the United Arab Emirates and Ambassador Kaha \r\nlmnadze of Georgia as the new co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. I also take this opportunity to thank the \r\ntwo previous co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, Ambassador Ion Jinga of Romania and \r\nAmbassador Mohamed Khaled Khiari of Tunisia, for \r\ntheir significant work and unflagging determination to \r\nbridge the divisions that remain among Member States.\r\nWith the imminent commencement of another \r\nround of the intergovernmental negotiations in view, \r\nallow me to reiterate Poland’s strong support for the \r\nprocess and to share with the General Assembly a few \r\nremarks on the priorities that we see ahead.\r\nThe Security Council is at the heart of the \r\ninternational order. As a newly elected member, Poland \r\nsees the growing complexity of the international \r\nenvironment. The proliferation of conflicts and their \r\ntransnational nature make the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform all the \r\nmore important.\r\nProceeding from the areas of convergence identified \r\nin the last session’s food-for-thought paper, we remain \r\ncommitted to striving towards the enlargement of the \r\nSecurity Council so that it becomes more reflective \r\nof the realities of today’s world. All regional groups \r\nshould be given a voice in discussions and decisions \r\nof vital importance. In this context, we continue to \r\nsupport the proposal for an additional seat in the \r\nSecurity Council for the Group of Eastern European \r\nStates — the Group that saw its membership grow the \r\nmost in recent decades.\r\nWe also look forward to continuing discussions on \r\nthe veto power — the thorniest of issues, but also one \r\nthat we strongly believe should not be shied away from \r\nif further politicization of the veto is to be stopped. The \r\nright of veto carries with it enormous responsibility, \r\nand its currency is human lives. Any initiative aimed \r\nat ensuring its advised application can count on \r\nour support.\r\nLast but not least, transparency and greater \r\naccess to information about the Security Council’s \r\ndecision-making process is seen by Poland as a \r\nprerequisite for restoring trust in international law \r\nand an indispensable element of promoting the \r\n08/11/2017 A/72/PV.43\r\n17-37096 3/12\r\nengagement of international audiences in peaceful \r\nconflict resolution.\r\nIn conclusion, let me once again state Poland’s \r\nunwavering support for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process. We remain convinced that it is vital \r\nto continue the dialogue among Member States if we \r\nare to attain the goal of ensuring that the Organization \r\ncan face the ever-greater challenges ahead.\r\nMr. Şen (Turkey): We align ourselves with the \r\nstatement delivered by the Permanent Representative \r\nof Italy on behalf of the Uniting for Consensus group \r\n(see A/72/PV.41). I wish to make the following remarks \r\nin my national capacity.\r\nWe appreciate your engagement in the process, \r\nMr. President, and warmly welcome Ambassadors \r\nNusseibeh and Imnadze in their new capacities as the \r\nco-Chairs. We look forward to closely cooperating with \r\nthem in the upcoming session of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. We also \r\nexpress our gratitude to the former co-Chairs for their \r\nefforts in favour of finding areas of convergences in \r\norder to reach consensus on this important matter.\r\nSecurity Council reform is a matter of global \r\nimportance, which has a direct impact on the lives \r\nof current and future generations. We advocate for a \r\nmeaningful and principled reform that would bring \r\nabout a more democratic, representative, effective and \r\ntransparent Council, and one, more importantly, that \r\nis more accountable. We believe this can be achieved \r\nby increasing only the number of elected members \r\nof the Council. The permanent membership and the \r\nveto mechanism provide a clear explanation for the \r\nSecurity Council’s inaction, which is a situation that \r\nneeds to be rectified, but not by strengthening the \r\npermanent membership or the veto mechanism. Indeed, \r\nit is not at all clear to us how adding new permanent \r\nmembers or expanding veto powers will enhance the \r\nCouncil’s accountability.\r\nFor those aspiring to serve the cause of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security for longer periods, we, \r\nthe Uniting for Consensus Group, are proposing longer-\r\nterms seats with the possibility of re-election. Ideally, \r\nthe veto should be abolished. There is no justification \r\nfor certain members having this right while others do \r\nnot. In this respect, we support the initiatives to limit \r\nthe use of negative vote in cases of mass atrocities. A \r\nmore equitable representation of the regional groups \r\nand a fair system of rotation, including enhanced \r\nopportunities for underrepresented groups, is a must in \r\nthe reformed Council. However, the working methods \r\nand the relationship with the General Assembly are no \r\nless important, as they define the daily dynamics of \r\nthe system.\r\nMy delegation is looking forward to engaging \r\nconstructively in the upcoming intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations to achieve progress based on the foregoing \r\nprinciples, which will address the shortcomings of \r\nthe current system and enhance the legitimacy of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Mendoza García (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My delegation thanks you, Mr. President, \r\nfor once again convening this annual debate on the \r\nrepresentativeness and membership of the Security \r\nCouncil. We endorse the statement made by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Italy on behalf of the \r\nUniting for Consensus group (see A/72/PV.41). We \r\nwould like to thank Ambassadors Ion Jinga and \r\nMohamed Khaled Khiari, of Romania and Tunisia, \r\nrespectively, for their hard work and dedication during \r\nthe last session.\r\nIn the same vein, Mr. President, we take this \r\nopportunity to recognize your appointment of the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Georgia and the United \r\nArab Emirates, Ambassadors Kaha Imnadze and Lana \r\nZaki Nusseibeh, as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We wish them success in their work. My \r\ncountry assures them of our unqualified collaboration \r\nduring the current session of negotiations.\r\nMy country considers that the process of reform \r\nof the Security Council deserves to be taken seriously \r\nand responsibly. We believe that it provides us with \r\nthe express possibility to transform the United Nations \r\ninto a more effective and representative Organization, \r\naimed at improving its capacity to respond effectively \r\nand diligently to threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity. This new session presents us with a renewed \r\nopportunity to be ambitious, thereby making us able to \r\nachieve a more responsible, transparent and inclusive \r\nCouncil. We are convinced that now is the moment \r\nfor us to agree on a reform that has the capacity \r\nto adjust to the current international geopolitical \r\ncontext and the constant changes that are manifested \r\nwithin that context, highlighting the principles of \r\ndemocracy and representativeness, which have been \r\nand which we consider to continue to be cornerstones \r\nof the Organization.\r\nA/72/PV.43 08/11/2017\r\n4/12 17-37096\r\nIt is on that foundation that we build our position, \r\nreflected in what was expressed by the representative \r\nof Italy on behalf of the Uniting for Consensus group \r\n(see A/72/PV.41), which proposes an increase in the \r\nnumber of seats in the Security Council, but only in the \r\ncategory of non-permanent members, with the option \r\nof long-term seats with the possibility of immediate \r\nre-election and greater regional representation. In this \r\nway, the African people would have the greatest number \r\nof seats. It would also provide greater opportunities for \r\nparticipation for smaller countries and small island \r\nStates. We believe in the need to create the conditions \r\nthat would allow all States Members of the United \r\nNations to have an equal opportunity to participate \r\nwithin the Council.\r\nIn that same vein, we cannot leave aside the issue \r\nof the veto. So far, the use of the veto has undermined \r\nthe Council’s credibility in its decisions and has \r\ncurtailed the responsibility to protect those most \r\nvulnerable, as well as its ability and effectiveness in \r\nensuring global peace and security. Costa Rica has \r\nadvocated on multiple occasions for prohibiting the \r\nuse of the veto, especially in situations involving \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law, crimes \r\nagainst humanity or genocide, in line with the code of \r\nconduct proposed by the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency group, which already has 114 signatories \r\nand for which we reiterate our unequivocal support. We \r\nalso support the French-Mexican initiative. For these \r\nreasons, Costa Rica believes that the privilege of the \r\nveto should not be extended to any new members of \r\nthe Council, as we believe that it generates inequality, \r\nrestricts decision-making and causes immobility, thus \r\nhaving a negative impact on the Council’s effectiveness.\r\nAs a result of the foregoing, we have repeatedly \r\nrespectfully appealed to countries to move away from \r\npositions that focus on increasing the category of \r\npermanent members with veto rights, which we consider \r\ncontrary to the call for democracy, alternation and \r\ntransparency, which we all want. That is why we invite \r\nthe Assembly to consider an intermediate position that \r\nwould allow us to finally address the discussions on \r\nthe points of convergence that, until now, we have been \r\nidentifying and on which we are convinced that we can \r\ncontinue to build.\r\nThe annual exercise of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations should be, as we have said before, an \r\nexercise in f lexibility, commitment and consensus-\r\nbuilding. Costa Rica is ready to continue talking and to \r\nconsider intermediate positions where we have as our \r\nmain motivating factor the achievement of a Security \r\nCouncil that is truly representative and effective in \r\ncarrying out its key tasks, in favour of international \r\npeace, security and stability. We hope to achieve a more \r\nefficient Organization that responds adequately to the \r\ncurrent global environment and whose fundamental \r\nobjective is the general welfare of all its members.\r\nMr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank you, Mr. President, for convening today’s \r\ndebate on agenda item 122, “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and other matters related to the \r\nSecurity Council”.\r\nWe welcome the appointment of the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Georgia and the United Arab Emirates \r\nas co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations and \r\nassure them of our full support. We also commend the \r\ncontribution made by their predecessors, the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Romania and Tunisia.\r\nThe interest of the international community in \r\nthe earliest possible reform of the Security Council \r\nis obvious. It arises from the threats and challenges \r\nthat the world faces nowadays and from the functions \r\nof the Security Council, on which Member States \r\nconferred primary responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security, asking for it to act \r\non their behalf, as provided for by the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. The general view is that the Security \r\nCouncil needs to be reformed in order to reflect current \r\nrealities and ensure its transparent, efficient, effective \r\nand accountable functioning.\r\nIn the 2005 World Summit Outcome, the Heads \r\nof State and Heads of Government supported early \r\nreform of the Security Council as an essential element \r\nof the overall effort to reform the United Nations so as \r\nto make it more broadly representative, efficient and \r\ntransparent, thereby further enhancing its effectiveness \r\nand the legitimacy and implementation of its decisions. \r\nWe note the gradual progress in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations and the active engagement of Member \r\nStates in the process, despite remaining extensive \r\ndifferences and disagreements on the substance. The \r\nprocess of negotiations should build on the work that \r\nhas already been done, with a view to increasing \r\nconvergence and ensuring the widest possible political \r\nacceptance and support.\r\n08/11/2017 A/72/PV.43\r\n17-37096 5/12\r\nThe discussions during the previous session have \r\nproduced an important outcome, reflected in the latest \r\nversion of the elements of commonality and issues \r\nfor further consideration on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters. We hope \r\nthat such an outcome will contribute to taking the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations forward and achieving \r\nthe much-needed reform of the Security Council.\r\nExpanding the membership of the Security Council \r\nwhile maintaining the effective and operational \r\nfunctioning of the Council could help enhance its \r\nauthority and ensure its greater legitimacy, provided \r\nthat such an expansion is based on fair and equitable \r\ngeographical distribution, taking into account the \r\nequitable representation of developing countries, \r\nincluding small States, as well as of unrepresented \r\nand underrepresented regions and groups, in particular \r\nthe Group of Eastern European States. We support \r\nAfrica’s increased and enhanced membership in the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council should go \r\nhand in hand with the improvement of its working \r\nmethods and decision-making. We commend the \r\nSecurity Council for adopting the note by the President \r\nof the Security Council (S/2017/507) on 30 August. \r\nFurther efforts in that direction, including through the \r\nInformal Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions, are needed in order to enhance \r\nthe Council’s efficiency and transparency, as well as its \r\ninteractions and dialogues with non-Council members. \r\nWe believe that such efforts will also promote the \r\nreform of the Security Council itself. Indeed, there \r\nis much to do, and the reasons the Council’s rules of \r\nprocedure have remained provisional for decades are \r\nself-explanatory.\r\nIt is important to give the larger membership \r\nof the United Nations more opportunities to be \r\nheard. Apart from open debates, informal interactive \r\nmeetings also provide opportunities for dialogue with \r\nnon-members of the Council. We take positive note \r\nof some developments in that regard. The Security \r\nCouncil should be a more collaborative body, taking \r\ninto consideration that both permanent and elected \r\nmembers of the Council bear collective responsibility \r\nfor international peace and security.\r\nAnother important issue is the implementation of \r\ndecisions adopted by the Security Council. Needless \r\nto say, the lack of proper attention by the Council \r\nto the apparent disregard and misinterpretation of \r\nits resolutions containing binding demands cannot \r\nconstitute an accepted practice of its working methods. \r\nIt is intolerable that armed aggressions against \r\nsovereign States and the resulting military occupation \r\nof their territories continue despite Security Council \r\nresolutions. As to the relationship between the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, it is essential \r\nthat both organs uphold their respective functions to \r\nmaintain due balance and complementarity, in full \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the \r\nreform of the Security Council should be decided by the \r\ngeneral membership through inclusive and transparent \r\nintergovernmental negotiations and should address \r\nthe positions and concerns of all Member States. \r\nAzerbaijan looks forward to engaging constructively in \r\nthat process.\r\nMr. Duarte Lopes (Portugal): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to commend the stewardship provided by the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Tunisia and Romania as \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations during \r\nthe seventy-first session and welcome the appointment \r\nof this year’s co-Chairs, the Permanent Representatives \r\nof Georgia and the United Arab Emirates, to whom I \r\nconvey my best wishes and support for the challenging \r\nwork ahead.\r\nWith regard to Security Council reform, Portugal \r\nbelieves that the process should be inclusive, transparent \r\nand comprehensive, and result from a wider consensus, \r\nnot just the two thirds of the General Assembly \r\nrequired by the Charter of the United Nations. Among \r\nother provisions, Portugal deems important that \r\nconsideration be given to increasing the numbers of \r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent members. In \r\nour view, and in order to reinforce inclusiveness without \r\naffecting efficiency, the expansion of the number of \r\nseats for potential new permanent members should not \r\ninclude the right to the veto.\r\nWe also believe that the creation of any additional \r\ncategory, other than the existing permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members, would not contribute to the \r\neffectiveness of the decision-making process. The \r\nreform of the Security Council should also include \r\ncontinuous improvement of its working methods. \r\nPortugal has been an advocate of this objective, in \r\n2012, as a non-permanent member of the Council and \r\nA/72/PV.43 08/11/2017\r\n6/12 17-37096\r\nChair of the Working Group on Documentation and \r\nOther Procedural Questions, as well as through the \r\nAccountability, Coherence and Transparency group.\r\nAs the United Nations organ with greater \r\nresponsibilities in the area of international peace \r\nand security, the Security Council needs reform that \r\nreflects the realities of the world today. As my Prime \r\nMinister recalled in this year’s general debate (see \r\nA/72/PV.8), Portugal believes that the African continent \r\nshould be adequately represented in both categories, \r\nand with regard to other continents, we believe that \r\nBrazil and India are two unavoidable examples. In \r\nimplementing the rotation principle, we also have \r\nto ensure opportunities for small and medium-sized \r\ncountries. We hope that this exercise will constitute an \r\nopportunity to narrow our focus on what can unite us, \r\nbuild broader common ground and make further efforts \r\ntowards a comprehensive consensus.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to commend you, \r\nMr. President, for your efforts and for committing \r\nyour leadership to the intergovernmental process. For \r\nour part, rest assured that we are ready to continue to \r\nengage actively and constructively in this process.\r\nMr. Ntwaagae (Botswana): Let me at the outset join \r\nother delegations that have preceded me in sincerely \r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, for convening this \r\nimportant meeting on Security Council reform. Sir, \r\nmy delegation welcomes your appointment of the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Georgia and the United \r\nArab Emirates as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. We assure \r\nthem of the full support of the Botswana delegation.\r\nMr. President, convening this meeting at an early \r\nstage of your tenure demonstrates your eagerness and \r\ncommitment to commencing the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. I also applaud the co-Chairs for having \r\naccepted that honourable responsibility and pledge the \r\nfull support of my delegation for and cooperation with \r\ntheir efforts to advance the negotiations on this very \r\nimportant question, which has remained on the agenda \r\nof the General Assembly for a very long time.\r\nBotswana also aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Sierra Leone on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States (see A/72/PV.41).\r\nBotswana reaffirms its commitment to the Common \r\nAfrican Position on the proposed Security Council \r\nreforms, as enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and \r\nthe Sirte Declaration, which calls, first, for Africa’s \r\nfull participation in all decision-making organs of the \r\nUnited Nations, particularly in the Security Council, \r\nwhich is the principal decision-making organ charged \r\nwith the responsibility of maintaining international \r\npeace and security.\r\nSecondly, it calls for the full representation of Africa \r\nin the Security Council, including the allocation of no \r\nfewer than two permanent seats with all the prerogatives \r\nand privileges of permanent membership, including the \r\nright of veto, and the allocation of five non-permanent \r\nseats. We strongly believe that the comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council will make the Council \r\nmore inclusive, democratic and representative of all \r\nregions of the world, thereby correcting the historical \r\ninjustice emanating from the exclusion of the African \r\ncontinent from the permanent category, as well as its \r\nunderrepresentation in the non-permanent category.\r\nAs previous speakers have indicated, the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations have been protracted \r\nbecause of the complexities of the issues relating \r\nto the categories of membership, the question of \r\nveto, regional representation, the size of an enlarged \r\nSecurity Council, the working methods of the Council \r\nand the relationship between the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly. We are pleased to note that in \r\nrecent years there has been a convergence of views on \r\nsome of the positions and proposals made by Member \r\nStates and regional groups, and the Common African \r\nPosition continues to enjoy cross-regional support from \r\nthe entire United Nations membership.\r\nThere is broad consensus that the Security Council \r\nreform should reflect the geopolitical realities of the \r\ntwenty-first century. It is also widely believed that \r\nthe reforms will enhance the Council’s accountability, \r\ntransparency, legitimacy and effectiveness in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The \r\ndesired outcome is to ensure the fair and equitable \r\nrepresentation of small, medium-sized and large States. \r\nHowever, there are divergent views on the size, scope \r\nand modalities of the enlargement of the Council and \r\nthe retention of the veto.\r\nIn that regard, we urge the co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to build on the progress \r\nachieved thus far in the reform process. To move the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations forward, Member \r\nStates should continue to build on the outcome \r\ndocuments that were produced during the sixty-ninth, \r\n08/11/2017 A/72/PV.43\r\n17-37096 7/12\r\nseventieth and seventy-first sessions of the General \r\nAssembly. It also desirable, even imperative, that \r\nMember States and regional groups adopt f lexible and \r\nconstructive positions that could assist in advancing the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nWith those few remarks, I would conclude by \r\nreaffirming Botswana’s commitment to decision 62/557 \r\nand other relevant General Assembly decisions that \r\nseek to address the question of equitable distribution on \r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand other matters related to the Security Council.\r\nMr. Bessedik (Algeria): At the outset, I would like \r\nto reiterate the appreciation expressed by Ambassador \r\nAdikalie Foday Sumah of Sierra Leone, Coordinator \r\nof the Committee of Ten, on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States, with which we align ourselves, for the \r\ninterest that you, Mr. President, have shown in the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of the Security Council. We appreciate \r\nthe efforts made by the previous co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the previous \r\nsession, Ambassadors Mohamed Khaled Khiari and \r\nIon Jinga of Tunisia and Romania, respectively. We \r\nwarmly welcome the new co-Chairs, Ambassadors \r\nKaha Imnadze and Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Georgia and the United Arab \r\nEmirates, respectively, whom we fully support in the \r\nupcoming session of intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nWe are convinced of the necessity of achieving a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations system \r\nthat upholds the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, in line with decision 62/557, which \r\ncontinues to be the basis of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. The reform of the Security Council \r\nshould be comprehensive and address all substantive \r\nissues related to questions of membership, regional \r\nrepresentation and the Council’s agenda, working \r\nmethods and the decision-making process, including \r\nthe veto, inter alia; such reform should garner the \r\nwidest possible acceptance by Member States. We also \r\ninsist upon the critical importance of the interlinkages \r\nof the five negotiable clusters.\r\nWe wish to reiterate and insist upon the fact that \r\nthe framework document, which was circulated in July \r\n2015 and which reflects all of the different positions \r\nheld, should remain the main reference as far as the \r\npursuit of intergovernmental negotiations is concerned. \r\nIndeed, my delegation believes that we cannot take up \r\nthe issue of the size of an enlarged Security Council \r\nwithout examining the categories of membership \r\nbecause an enlargement of the Council in either or both \r\nof the permanent and non-permanent categories will \r\nundoubtedly affect its size. In addition, the size of an \r\nenlarged Council will also no doubt affect the issue of \r\nequitable regional representation. In other words, in \r\norder to correct the current imbalance of the Security \r\nCouncil, we must enlarge its size and take into account \r\nthe prolonged historical injustice brought to bear \r\nagainst the African continent. This explains the need \r\nfor a comprehensive reform of the Security Council, as \r\nopposed to an intermediate reform thereof.\r\nIn the current international context, it is \r\nunacceptable that Africa is the sole continent not to \r\nbe represented in the permanent category. At the same \r\ntime, it is also underrepresented in the non-permanent \r\ncategory of the Council. We will therefore continue to \r\ndemand the allocation of no less than two permanent \r\nseats to Africa, with all the prerogatives and privileges \r\nof permanent membership, as well as a total of five \r\nnon-permanent seats. The issue of the selection of \r\nsuch representatives should not be instrumentalized \r\nby some stakeholders; it is a sovereign decision for the \r\nAfrican Member States to make. I would remind the \r\nAssembly that the African Union has its own competent \r\nmechanisms mandated to select candidates to serve in \r\nmultilateral organizations, such as the United Nations.\r\nOn the other hand, we insist on the importance of \r\nimproving the working methods of the Security Council. \r\nWith regard to the relationship between the General \r\nAssembly and the Council, we reiterate that while \r\nclose cooperation is needed, each body must uphold its \r\nrespective mandates, as provided for by the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, in order to maintain balance and \r\nefficiency in the actions by the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation regrets that the paper on the \r\nelements of commonalities and issues for further \r\nconsideration from the previous session did not fully \r\nreflect the Common African Position on Security \r\nCouncil reform. My delegation expected that the \r\nco-Chairs would underline that the Common African \r\nPosition has garnered wide political acceptance during \r\nthe current intergovernmental negotiations, which is \r\nwhy our continent needed to be allocated seats in both \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories of the \r\nCouncil. We look forward to the continuation of the \r\ndiscussion in the framework of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform during the \r\nA/72/PV.43 08/11/2017\r\n8/12 17-37096\r\nseventy-second session of the General Assembly. We \r\nalso look forward to the outcome document of this \r\nmeeting and hope that we will build on the progress \r\nmade so far.\r\nAs part of the African Group and the Group \r\nof Arab States, we stand ready to constructively \r\nengage with you, Mr. President, the new co-Chairs \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations, and the entire \r\nUnited Nations membership so as to advance the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process towards \r\ncomprehensive reform, as stipulated in decision \r\n62/557. We aim to achieve an equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation and an increase in the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council, with an expansion in both categories, \r\ncontributing, as a result, to the enhanced legitimacy of \r\nits decisions in the eyes of both the general membership \r\nand international public opinion.\r\nWe believe in a more representative, more \r\ndemocratic and more transparent Security Council, \r\nwith, ultimately, enhanced authority and effectiveness, \r\nso that there is greater transparency and legitimacy \r\nin its debate. My delegation is of the view that the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations should be webcast, \r\nas is now the case for the debate in the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Ramírez Carreño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The delegation of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela welcomes the decision \r\nof the President of the General Assembly to appoint the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Georgia and the United \r\nArab Emirates as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We express our full support to them to \r\ncontribute to the achievement of credible progress on \r\nsuch an important issue of the United Nations agenda. \r\nLikewise, we extend our appreciation to the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Romania and Tunisia for the work \r\nthat they carried out within the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during the past session.\r\nThe complexity of the challenges posed in the \r\nareas of peace and security, economic and social \r\ndevelopment and human rights requires a renewed \r\nand strengthened Organization that allows the United \r\nNations to provide adequate political responses in order \r\nto promote effective and timely solutions. Accordingly, \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations, including \r\nthe Security Council, is one of the main pillars of the \r\nprocess to which we must commit in order for our \r\nefforts to lead to success. The Security Council must be \r\nmore representative, democratic and transparent, and \r\nin line with the current situation in the world.\r\nWhile there may be full agreement among Member \r\nStates on the need to reform the Security Council, this \r\nobjective has not been achieved in the more than two \r\ndecades since the issue was added to the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in 1994. We remain concerned that \r\nno real progress has been made towards an agreement \r\non this matter of priority. The fact that negotiations \r\nhave stalled undermines the credibility of the process \r\nand raises doubts about the willingness of some United \r\nNations Members to work towards reforming the \r\nCouncil with a vision based on concrete results. That \r\nis why we believe that we need to reflect on what has \r\nbeen done so far and call for greater political resolve. \r\nIn this context, after 20 years of discussions, Venezuela \r\nbelieves that we are at a sufficiently advanced stage to \r\ncall for the launching of a substantive process based \r\non a negotiated draft text with a view to achieving \r\ntangible results.\r\nOn the question of a possible and unavoidable \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council, \r\nwe believe that the reform process should ensure that \r\ncountries from the developing world are included, \r\nin particular those from Africa, Latin America, the \r\nCaribbean, Asia and the Middle East. A larger Security \r\nCouncil should include different geographical, political \r\nand cultural realities, mainly from the developing world, \r\nbearing in mind the need to represent the historical \r\naspirations of our regions. Similarly, Venezuela would \r\nbe interested in a possible amendment to the Charter \r\nso that the non-permanent members in the Council \r\ncould be re-elected for a period no longer than two \r\nconsecutive years.\r\nPersistent inconsistencies in the Security Council’s \r\nworking methods mean that we cannot postpone \r\ndecisions that would ensure greater participation by \r\nMember States in Council discussions and which \r\nwould enable Member States’ views to be taken into \r\naccount in the decision-making process. It is quite a \r\ncontradiction that, while peace is an issue that affects \r\nthe entire membership of the Organization, there is no \r\nopen consideration of items on the Council’s agenda, \r\nowing to the rigid opposition from some permanent \r\nmembers. Open meetings should be the rule and not the \r\nexception, which has unfortunately been the case.\r\n08/11/2017 A/72/PV.43\r\n17-37096 9/12\r\nSimilarly, the absence of a definitive set of rules \r\nof procedure and the discretionary nature of this \r\norgan’s operations in accordance with some permanent \r\nmembers’ interests has a negative impact on the working \r\nmethods of the Council. That is why we call for the \r\nadoption of final rules of procedure so that the Council \r\ncan act with a sense of equity, balance and transparency.\r\nFurthermore, we cannot fail to mention our \r\nconcern over the abuse of the use of sanctions, which \r\nare sometimes resorted to hastily and on political \r\ngrounds, which is contrary to the peaceful settlement \r\nof conflicts, in situations where there is no real threat \r\nto international peace and security. It is the case that \r\napproximately 70 per cent of the Security Council \r\nsanction committees deal with fraternal countries \r\nin Africa.\r\nAlthough we recognize that sanctions work well \r\nas a last resort for shifting conflict situations towards \r\npeace, we should nevertheless focus primarily on the \r\nmeans of peaceful settlements of disputes. Similarly, we \r\nbelieve that sanctions should have a limited time frame, \r\nbe periodically reviewed and set forth clear criteria for \r\ntheir being lifted. We believe that a country cannot be \r\nindefinitely subjected to sanctions without taking into \r\naccount how the State concerned is cooperating or \r\nwithout consulting experts.\r\nThroughout its history, decision-making in the \r\nCouncil has been criticized for being contrary to the \r\nprinciple of sovereign equality of States. Although we \r\nrecognize that some permanent members have used the \r\nveto responsibly, we cannot deny that sometimes the \r\nveto has become an obstacle to solving long-standing \r\nconflicts, such as the case of Palestine, where the United \r\nStates has used the veto to favour the occupying Power. \r\nUnfortunately, this year we are commemorating 70 \r\nyears of Al-Nakba — the expulsion of the Palestinians \r\nfrom their land — 50 years of the occupation of \r\nPalestine and the Golan Heights by Israel, and 10 \r\nyears since the Israeli blockade of Gaza. This entire \r\ntragedy, which stems from the systematic violation \r\nof international law, international humanitarian law \r\nand its own Security Council and General Assembly \r\nresolutions, has occurred and will continue to occur as \r\na result of the systematic use of the veto by the United \r\nStates and its support for the occupying Power Israel \r\nwithin the Security Council.\r\nThe United States are therefore not only abusing \r\ntheir prerogative powers as permanent members, but \r\nthey are distorting the very goals and raison d’être of \r\nthe Security Council. Instead of ensuring world peace \r\nand contributing to the peaceful resolution of conflicts, \r\nthe Council has become a perpetrator of the Israeli \r\noccupation of Palestine and a destabilizer of the Middle \r\nEast and North Africa. When the United States does not \r\nhave or cannot obtain the Security Council’s support, \r\nit acts unilaterally, as it did in the illegal military \r\nintervention in Iraq, with the terrible consequences that \r\npeople in the Middle East are still suffering from today.\r\nToday, the Permanent Representative of the United \r\nStates used this rostrum to describe the General \r\nAssembly as a political farce. The fact that we voted \r\noverwhelmingly — 191 votes in favour — to reject the \r\ncriminal blockade against Cuba (resolution 72/4) and \r\nthat the same representative then says that this historic \r\nGeneral Assembly decision does not matter shows that \r\nthe United States is trying to use the Security Council to \r\nintervene in the internal affairs of Venezuela by using \r\nall kinds of tricks and manipulations and all types of \r\nparallel and informal processes.\r\nThe entire United Nations membership, the \r\nmembers of the Security Council and the countries of \r\nour region know that Venezuela is not a threat to peace \r\nand international security. We Venezuelans, as we have \r\nsaid and shown, will resolve our own issues ourselves \r\nin peace, and we demand respect for our sovereignty \r\nand independence. There should be no further North \r\nAmerican intervention in our affairs. The actions of the \r\nUnited States reveal their true intentions to destabilize \r\nour country. Latin America and the Caribbean is a zone \r\nof peace, and the United States will not be able to force \r\nus into violence and war.\r\nThe Security Council cannot be used in a way that \r\ndiffers from the idea behind its conception, namely, to \r\npreserve peace and international security. It cannot be \r\nused as a tool for a particular permanent member of \r\nthe Security Council, in this case, the United States, to \r\nfurther its own national interests and to destabilize our \r\ncountry. Unless such practices are ended, reforming the \r\nSecurity Council will serve no purpose.\r\nIn conclusion, Venezuela reaffirms its support \r\nfor the shared goal of reforming the Security Council \r\nwithout distorting its purpose or character, which is \r\nan important element in the process of strengthening \r\nthe Organization. We cannot have a renewed and \r\nrevitalized Organization unless we have truly reformed \r\nthe Security Council. We cannot have organs within \r\nA/72/PV.43 08/11/2017\r\n10/12 17-37096\r\nthe United Nations, such as the Security Council, that \r\nact in breach of the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in \r\nFrench): At the outset, I thank you, Sir, for convening \r\nthis meeting.\r\nSecurity Council reform is important for the \r\ncredibility and smooth functioning of the United \r\nNations. Reforming the Security Council is necessary \r\nin order to make it more representative, effective and \r\ntransparent. That is an objective that we hold dear and \r\nthat I believe is shared by all.\r\nThis is not the place to reiterate the position of \r\nmy country on the specifics of Council reform. Those \r\npositions are well known and reflected in the document \r\ncirculated in 2015 by President Kutesa and in the \r\nelements of the convergence paper distributed in 2016 \r\nand 2017 by Presidents Lykketoft and Thomson. I would \r\nsimply like to underline the importance of increasing the \r\nrepresentativeness of the Council by enabling African \r\ncountries in particular to take their rightful place on \r\nthe Council and ensuring the effective participation of \r\nsmall and medium-sized Member States in the work \r\nof an enlarged Council. Given the growing inclusion \r\nof regional organizations in the work of the Security \r\nCouncil, we also believe that we should take that aspect \r\ninto account in our considerations on Council reform.\r\nProgress has been made in recent years. We must \r\ncontinue on that basis. Allow me to reiterate our special \r\nthanks to our colleagues from Romania and Tunisia, \r\nand Luxembourg before them, for the impartial, \r\neffective and transparent manner in which they \r\nchaired the intergovernmental negotiations on reform \r\nat recent sessions of the Assembly General. We hope \r\nthat the substantial elements of commonality that were \r\nidentified at the last session will be useful in future \r\nnegotiations and a source of inspiration for further \r\nreconciling our positions in the future, with a view to \r\nthe comprehensive reform of the Security Council.\r\nI congratulate our colleagues, the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Georgia and the United Arab \r\nEmirates, Ambassador Kaha Imnadze and Ambassador \r\nLana Zaki Nusseibeh, for their appointment as co-Chairs \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations at this session.\r\nWe must all contribute if we are to make headway. \r\nBelgium is convinced that if Member States engage \r\nand negotiate in good faith, the Security Council can be \r\nreformed. I can assure the Assembly that my country \r\nwill continue to actively engage in the negotiations. The \r\nco-Chairs and you, Sir, can count on our full support.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, I thank you, Mr. President, on behalf of \r\nmy delegation for your letter to Member States dated \r\n30 October 2017, highlighting your eagerness to move \r\nforward the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform.\r\nWe also welcome the appointment of Mr. Kaha \r\nImnadze, Permanent Representative of Georgia, and \r\nMrs. Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, Permanent Representative \r\nof the United Arab Emirates, as co-Chairs of the \r\nnegotiations. We will give them our full support as they \r\nlead the intergovernmental negotiations at this session, \r\nwhich is as important as previous ones.\r\nSince we began our discussions to reform the \r\nSecurity Council 24 years ago, a number of international \r\nand regional initiatives have been launched regarding \r\nthe five elements of reform, as set out in decision 62/557. \r\nThat has given us momentum to move forward on \r\nproposals made in the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nNevertheless, obstacles remain. We do not have the \r\npolitical will necessary to unite our viewpoints and \r\nachieve our common objective, especially on the \r\npart of the five permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil. There is an increasing number of international \r\nchallenges, which should prompt us to press on with \r\nthe negotiations and to promote collective action. All \r\nproposals to enlarge and reform the Security Council \r\nshould therefore enjoy full or, at the very least, the \r\nbroadest possible consensus.\r\nThe position of my country on Security Council \r\nreform has not changed for many years. It is based on \r\nthe following steadfast principles.\r\nFirst, the question of Security Council reform must \r\nbe part of a comprehensive vision that will help us to \r\ncontinue the process of reforming all United Nations \r\nentities, thereby bringing greater complementarity \r\nand balance to the work of the Organization. We must \r\nalso strengthen the relationship between the Security \r\nCouncil and other United Nations bodies and agencies \r\nwithout encroaching on the prerogatives of organs \r\nsuch as the General Assembly or the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. The role of the Security Council must \r\nbe limited to its mandate under the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations — maintaining international peace \r\nand security.\r\n08/11/2017 A/72/PV.43\r\n17-37096 11/12\r\nSecondly, any proposal to reform the Security \r\nCouncil must be based on our common belief that the \r\nCouncil should become more representative of Member \r\nStates and reflect the international reality, which has \r\nchanged a great deal since the inception of the United \r\nNations in 1945.\r\nThirdly, we must also pursue our efforts to \r\nimprove the working methods of the Security Council \r\nby ensuring greater transparency and effectiveness in \r\nits work.\r\nFourthly, any increase in the number of Council \r\nseats must allow small countries to be represented on \r\nthe Council and to contribute to its work. It is therefore \r\nimportant to take into account the Arab and Muslim \r\ncountries that wish to be represented commensurate \r\nwith their importance and ability to defend the \r\nobjectives of the Charter. We therefore fully support \r\nthe Arab position, which calls for a permanent Arab \r\nseat enjoying the same prerogatives as other permanent \r\nseats. If the Council were to be enlarged, we would \r\nalso call for appropriate Arab representation in the \r\nnon-permanent category.\r\nWe are convinced that the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations are the one forum where we can achieve \r\nan agreement on the enlargement and reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, in accordance with decision 62/557, \r\nwhich laid the framework for those negotiations.\r\nIn conclusion, my country insists that any progress \r\nin the reform process will require patience and \r\nf lexibility, and that any measure that does not derive \r\nfrom consensus among Member States will pose an \r\nobstacle to the Organization and to the credibility of \r\nthe negotiations.\r\nMr. Imnadze (Georgia): On behalf of my fellow \r\nco-Chair, the Permanent Representative of the United \r\nArab Emirates, Mrs. Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, and \r\nmyself, allow me to express my profound thanks for \r\nentrusting us with the important task of facilitating \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on the question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and other matters \r\nrelated to the Council. It is indeed an honour and a \r\nprivilege to be given this opportunity to contribute \r\nto a process that is so central to strengthening \r\nour Organization.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations have \r\ncome quite a long way, and it would be naive to \r\nunderestimate the complexity of the matter at hand. \r\nHowever, throughout the year, certain elements of \r\nconvergence have been identified, and we have all \r\nagreed that discussions pertaining to reform are of \r\nvital importance to a stronger and more efficient \r\nOrganization today. The reform of the Security Council \r\nis first and foremost a Member State-driven process. \r\nTherefore, upon Ambassador Nusseibeh’s return to \r\nNew York, we will engage with all Member States and \r\ngroups in a transparent and inclusive manner to ensure \r\nthat we have a credible process aimed at bridging the \r\ngaps. Throughout this process, we will seek the advice \r\nand guidance of Member States. We will all need to be \r\nforward-looking, focusing not only on the positions that \r\nhave already been expressed and are well known but \r\nalso on how to move ahead in a meaningful way.\r\nFinally, let me thank our predecessors and \r\ncolleagues, Ambassadors Ion Jinga of Romania and \r\nMohamed Khaled Khiari of Tunisia, as well as the \r\nAmbassadors who preceded them, for their important \r\nwork in advancing the cause of Security Council \r\nreform. Once again, allow me to thank everyone for \r\ntheir kind words and shows of support to the co-Chairs, \r\nAmbassador Nusseibeh and myself. As the President of \r\nthe General Assembly said yesterday, we are indeed all \r\nin this together (see A/72/PV.41).\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nOne delegation has asked to speak in exercise of the \r\nright of reply. May I remind members that statements \r\nin the exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 \r\nminutes for the first intervention and to five minutes \r\nfor the second intervention and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Aung (Myanmar): I take the f loor to exercise \r\nthe right of reply to the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Liechtenstein (see A/72/PV.41).\r\nWe gather here to address the important issue of \r\nreform of the Security Council. The process of reform \r\nhas been going on for almost four decades, yet we have \r\nnot reached an agreement for meaningful and viable \r\nreform. This shows that undivided attention and avoiding \r\npoliticization are essential for successful reform. \r\nDuring the discussion, many delegations highlighted \r\nthe same point. We are of the view that if we are to \r\nachieve serious and successful reform, it is important \r\nto change the mindsets of delegations that attempt to \r\nexploit this important issue for their political agenda. \r\nA/72/PV.43 08/11/2017\r\n12/12 17-37096\r\nChanging their mindset will help the work of Member \r\nStates for serious reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 122.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I would like to inform members \r\nthat the consideration of agenda item 131, “Sexual \r\nexploitation and abuse: implementing a zero-tolerance \r\npolicy”, which was originally scheduled for Tuesday, \r\n14 November, has been postponed to a later date, to \r\nbe announced.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.15 a.m.\r\n"
