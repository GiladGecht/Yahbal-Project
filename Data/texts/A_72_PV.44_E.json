(Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 113\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(c) Election of five members of the International \r\nCourt of Justice\r\nMemorandum by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/72/181)\r\nList of candidates (A/72/182 and A/72/182/Add.1)\r\nCurricula vitae (A/72/183)\r\nThe President: Today, the General Assembly \r\nwill proceed to the election of five members of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for a nine-year term of \r\noffice commencing on 6 February 2018. The judges \r\nwhose terms of office expire on 5 February 2018 \r\nare Judge Ronny Abraham (France), Judge Dalveer \r\nBhandari (India), Judge Antônio Augusto Cançado \r\nTrindade (Brazil), Judge Christopher Greenwood \r\n(United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland), and Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somalia).\r\nI should like to draw the attention of the General \r\nAssembly to the documents it has before it relating to this \r\nelection. Document A/72/181 contains a memorandum \r\nby the Secretary-General on the current composition of \r\nthe Court and on the procedures to be followed in the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council with regard \r\nto the election. Document A/72/182 contains the list of \r\ncandidates nominated by national groups. Document \r\nA/72/183 contains the curricula vitae of the candidates \r\nnominated by national groups.\r\nIn that connection, I have been notified by the \r\nLegal Counsel that after the deadline established for \r\nnominating candidates, an additional nomination \r\nwas received with respect to a candidate whose name \r\nalready appears in document A/72/182. The additional \r\nnomination in question, of Mr. Dalveer Bhandari \r\n(India), is from the national group of Sri Lanka.\r\nI should also like to draw the attention of the \r\nAssembly to a note by the Secretary-General contained \r\nin document A/72/182/Add.1, in which he informs the \r\nAssembly that the national group of Zambia has decided \r\nto withdraw its nomination of Mr. Chaloka Beyani as \r\na candidate. His name is therefore not included on the \r\nballot papers. The names of the following six candidates \r\nwill therefore appear on the ballot papers: Mr. Ronny \r\nAbraham (France), Mr. Dalveer Bhandari (India), \r\nMr. Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade (Brazil), \r\nMr. Christopher Greenwood (United Kingdom of \r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, Mr. Nawaf Salam \r\n(Lebanon) and Mr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somalia).\r\nI should like to confirm that at this time, the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council will proceed, \r\nindependently of one another, to elect five members \r\nof the Court to fill the vacancies in accordance with \r\nArticle 8 of the Statute of the International Court of \r\nJustice. This election in the Assembly will be held in \r\naccordance with the Statute of the Court, in particular \r\nArticles 2 to 4 and 7 to 12, and with rules 150 and 151 \r\nof the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n17-37231 (E)\r\n*1737231*\r\nA/72/PV.44 09/11/2017\r\n2/5 17-37231\r\nAccording to Article 2 of the Statute, members of the \r\nCourt are to be elected, regardless of their nationality, \r\nfrom among persons of high moral character who \r\npossess the qualifications required in their respective \r\ncountries for appointment to the highest judicial \r\noffices, or are jurisconsults of recognized competence \r\nin international law. Article 9 requires electors to bear \r\nin mind not only that the person to be elected should \r\nindividually possess the qualifications required, but \r\nalso that in the body as a whole, the representation of \r\nthe main forms of civilization and of the principal legal \r\nsystems of the world should be assured.\r\nIn accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the \r\nStatute of the Court, those candidates who obtain an \r\nabsolute majority of votes both in the General Assembly \r\nand in the Security Council shall be considered as \r\nelected. The consistent practice of the United Nations \r\nhas been to interpret the words “absolute majority” as \r\nmeaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they \r\nvote or are allowed to vote. The electors in the General \r\nAssembly will be all 193 Member States. Accordingly, \r\nfor the purposes of the present election, 97 votes \r\nconstitute an absolute majority in the General Assembly.\r\nOnly those candidates whose names appear on the \r\nballot papers are eligible for election. The electors in \r\nthe General Assembly will indicate the candidates for \r\nwhom they wish to vote by placing crosses against their \r\nnames on the ballot papers. Each elector may vote for \r\nnot more than five candidates on the first ballot and, \r\non subsequent ballots, if any, for five candidates, less \r\nthe number of candidates who have already obtained \r\nabsolute majorities.\r\nAt the 915th plenary meeting of the General \r\nAssembly, held on 16 November 1960, a procedural \r\ndiscussion was held as to whether rule 94 — then \r\nrule 96 — of the rules of procedure of the Assembly \r\nshould be applied in elections to the International \r\nCourt of Justice. That rule lays down a procedure \r\nfor restricted ballots in the event that, after the first \r\nballot, the requisite number of candidates have not \r\nobtained the required majority. By 47 votes to 27, with \r\n25 abstentions, the Assembly decided that the rule did \r\nnot apply to elections to the Court and proceeded to \r\nelect the requisite number of candidates by a series of \r\nunrestricted ballots. That decision has subsequently \r\nbeen followed consistently.\r\nAccordingly, pursuant to rule 151 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the Assembly, if in the first ballot in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the number of candidates obtaining \r\nan absolute majority is less than five, a second ballot will \r\nbe held on the remaining candidates and balloting will \r\ncontinue at the same meeting until five candidates have \r\nobtained the required majority. Balloting will continue \r\nin the same meeting until five of the candidates have \r\nobtained the required majority of votes. However, if in \r\nthe first or subsequent ballots more than five candidates \r\nobtain an absolute majority, the General Assembly shall \r\nfollow the established practice and proceed to a new \r\nvote on all the candidates. Balloting will continue in the \r\nsame manner until five of the candidates have obtained \r\nthe required majority. Only when five candidates, not \r\nmore or fewer, have obtained the required majority in \r\nthe Assembly will the President of the Assembly notify \r\nthe President of the Security Council of the names of \r\nthe five candidates.\r\nIn accordance with Article 11 of the Statute, if \r\nupon comparison of the respective lists of candidates \r\nwho have obtained an absolute majority in the General \r\nAssembly and in the Security Council, fewer than \r\nfive candidates have been thus elected, the Assembly \r\nand the Council will proceed, again independently of \r\none another, at a second meeting — and, if necessary, \r\na third — to elect candidates by further ballots for \r\nthe seats remaining vacant, the results again being \r\ncompared after the required number of candidates have \r\nobtained an absolute majority in each organ.\r\nIf, however, after the third meeting, one or more \r\nseats still remain unfilled, the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council may at any time, at the request \r\nof either organ, form a joint conference consisting of \r\nsix members, three appointed by each organ. That joint \r\nconference may, by an absolute majority, agree on one \r\nname for each seat still vacant and submit the name or \r\nnames for the respective acceptance of the Assembly \r\nand the Council. If the joint conference is unanimously \r\nagreed, it may submit the name of a person not included \r\nin the list of nominations, provided that candidate fulfils \r\nthe required conditions, in accordance with Article 12, \r\nparagraph 2, of the Statute.\r\nIf the joint conference is satisfied that it will not be \r\nsuccessful in procuring an election, those members of \r\nthe Court who have already been elected shall, within \r\na period to be fixed by the Security Council, proceed \r\nto fill the vacant seat or seats by selection from among \r\nthose candidates who have obtained votes either in \r\nthe General Assembly or in the Security Council. In \r\naccordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 12 of the \r\n09/11/2017 A/72/PV.44\r\n17-37231 3/5\r\nStatute, in the event of an equality of votes among the \r\njudges, the eldest shall have a casting vote.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthese procedures at this election?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like to remind representatives \r\nthat, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure,\r\n“After the President has announced the \r\nbeginning of voting, no representative shall \r\ninterrupt the voting except on a point of order in \r\nconnection with the actual conduct of the voting”.\r\nAny announcements, including those concerning \r\nwithdrawals of candidatures, should therefore be made \r\nprior to the commencement of the voting process, that \r\nis to say, before the announcement of the beginning of \r\nthe voting process.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of \r\nrepresentatives during the time of the conduct of the \r\nelection. Members are reminded that during the voting \r\nprocess, all campaigning should cease in the General \r\nAssembly Hall. That means in particular that once the \r\nelection has begun, no more campaign material can \r\nbe distributed inside the Hall. All representatives are \r\nalso requested to remain at their seats so that the voting \r\nprocess can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank \r\nmembers for their cooperation.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers will now be distributed.\r\nBallot papers will be given only to the \r\nrepresentatives seated directly behind the country’s \r\nnameplate. Representatives are requested to use only \r\nthe ballot papers that are being distributed. Only \r\nthose candidates whose names appear on the ballot \r\npapers are eligible. Representatives will indicate the \r\nfive candidates for whom they wish to vote by placing \r\ncrosses to the left of their names on the ballot papers. \r\nBallot papers on which more than five names are \r\nmarked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast \r\nonly for those whose names appear on the ballot papers.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Aldoseri \r\n(Bahrain), Ms. Sánchez Rodríguez (Cuba), Mrs. Le \r\nDiffard (Hungary), Ms. Rheindrayani (Indonesia), \r\nMr. Zamporlini (Italy) and Mr. Waweru (Kenya) \r\nacted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.10 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as follows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  193\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting:  193\r\nRequired absolute majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Ronny Abraham (France)  165\r\nMr. Dalveer Bhandari (India)  149\r\nMr. Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade (Brazil) 153\r\nMr. Christopher Greenwood (United Kingdom  \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland) 147\r\nMr. Nawaf Salam (Lebanon)  148\r\nMr. Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (Somalia) 144\r\nIn the ballot just completed, more than five \r\ncandidates have obtained an absolute majority. Pursuant \r\nto the decision taken by the General Assembly at the \r\n45th plenary meeting of its fifty-fourth session, on \r\n3 November 1999, and in accordance with the decision \r\ntaken at the beginning of this meeting, a new ballot will \r\nbe held until only the required number of candidates, \r\nand no more, obtain an absolute majority. We shall \r\ntherefore proceed to another unrestricted ballot to fill \r\nthe remaining five vacancies.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.
