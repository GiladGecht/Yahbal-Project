In \r\naccordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the \r\nStatute of the Court, it will be necessary to hold another \r\nmeeting to fill the remaining vacancy.\r\nI propose that this meeting be adjourned and that \r\nthe next meeting to vote on the remaining vacancy be \r\nheld on Monday, 13 November 2017, at 3 p.m., owing to \r\nthe meeting schedule of the General Assembly.\r\nIt was so decided. \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.55 p.m.\r\n"
