"United Nations A/72/PV.48\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n48th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 13 November 2017, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 11\r\nSport for development and peace: building a \r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal\r\nDraft resolution (A/72/L.5)\r\nThe President: I want to start my statement today \r\nby acknowledging that sport is not always associated \r\nwith the United Nations, which is understandable. \r\nThe things that happen on a tennis court or a running \r\ntrack look very different from what we are doing here. \r\nHowever, there is in fact a strong link between sport and \r\nthe values and work of the United Nations, and today’s \r\nmeeting gives us an opportunity to reaffirm that link. I \r\nwant to make three points in that respect.\r\nFirst, simply put, sport can bring people together. It \r\nis founded on universal values that include discipline, \r\nfairness and respect for opponents and rules. We may \r\nspeak different languages or have different customs or \r\nviewpoints, but once we step onto a field or court, we \r\nare all part of the same system. In that way, sport can \r\nbe a universal instrument that can promote both peace \r\nand unity. The United Nations has used such a tool \r\nbefore, particularly through its peacekeeping missions \r\nand country teams. Sport has helped open doors in \r\nthe communities that the United Nations serves. It \r\nhas been used to build confidence and trust in post-\r\nconflict settings, and it has played an important role \r\nin the reintegration of ex-combatants, including child \r\nsoldiers. Certainly, sport alone cannot stop conflict \r\nor bring about peace, but I believe that a football or a \r\nhockey puck is a better peacekeeping tool than a gun. \r\nIt costs less money. It can build rather than destroy. It \r\nbrings people together instead of sending them fleeing \r\nfor their lives, and it invokes enthusiasm, not fear. I am \r\nconfident that the United Nations will continue to use \r\nthat tool in its work on the ground.\r\nThe second point that I want to make is that the \r\nOlympic Games and the United Nations aspire to the \r\nsame ideal, that is, an ideal based on humanity. It is \r\npredicated on the fact that no matter what is going on in \r\nState capitals around the world, people will always have \r\na space in which to engage and connect. That space can \r\nbe the finish line of an Olympic sprint, or a Hall such \r\nas this one. Whether as athletes or diplomats, we must \r\nuse such spaces. We must show that humankind can \r\ntriumph over politics.\r\nThe last point that I want to make relates to \r\nyouth. Sport can offer young people a platform for \r\nempowerment. It can give hope for a brighter future. \r\nIt can enable young people to build their capacity for \r\nstrategic thinking, teamwork and leadership, and \r\nit can provide a route out of underdevelopment and \r\npoverty. Increasingly, the United Nations is working to \r\nengage and empower young people all over the world. \r\nWe must reach out to young people in a way that will \r\nresonate with them. Sport offers a major opportunity \r\nin that respect. We have already seen some success in \r\nmobilizing athletes and sports teams to promote the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. We should work to \r\nsupport and replicate and expand on those examples.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n17-37640 (E)\r\n*1737640*\r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n2/28 17-37640\r\nIn conclusion, I want to stress the link between sport \r\nand the values and work of the United Nations. It is a \r\nlink that we should do more to strengthen. That is why \r\nwe should warmly welcome Olympic gold medallist \r\nMs. Kim Yuna to the General Assembly today, and why \r\nwe should seek out opportunities to support and use \r\nsport as a driver of peace, development and humankind. \r\nA major opportunity of this kind will present itself in \r\nFebruary, when the XXIII Olympic Winter Games will \r\nbe hosted in the Republic of Korea. It is more important \r\nthan ever to reaffirm the ideals of the United Nations \r\nand the Olympic Games on the Korean peninsula. \r\nWe must seize that opportunity. I therefore wish the \r\nRepublic of Korea every success in hosting the Winter \r\nGames and look forward to being in Pyeongchang \r\nmyself next February to attend the Games.\r\nI call on all countries to participate in the 2018 \r\nWinter Olympics. Let us demonstrate once again the \r\npower of sport to bring us together and overcome \r\npolitical, cultural and historical divides.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Republic of Korea to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/72/L.5.\r\nMr. Lee Hee-beom (Republic of Korea): On behalf \r\nof the Government of the Republic of Korea, it is a \r\ngreat honour and privilege for me to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/72/L.5, entitled “Sport for development \r\nand peace: building a peaceful and better world through \r\nsport and the Olympic ideal”.\r\nIn less than 90 days, the entire world will enjoy \r\nthe most spectacular Olympic Winter Games in \r\nPyeongchang on the Korean peninsula. The Republic \r\nof Korea is ready to welcome the world. We are ready \r\nto act as hosts to the Olympic family, the world’s \r\nmedia and spectators from around the world. I am very \r\npleased to report to the General Assembly that we have \r\ncompleted all the preparations for the Games, including \r\nthe construction of all competition and non-competition \r\nvenues. We have also finished building new roads, and a \r\nhigh-speed train will be open to the public in December. \r\nThe Olympic f lame arrived in Korea on 1 November \r\nand is currently travelling across the country, ready to \r\nwelcome the world.\r\nAs we all know, the General Assembly has made it \r\na tradition to adopt the Olympic Truce draft resolution \r\nevery two years since the adoption of resolution 48/11, \r\nin 1993. It is about reminding everyone and respecting \r\nthe ancient Olympic tradition in Greece of ceasing \r\nall hostilities during the Games. The draft resolution \r\nserves the purpose of ending all conflicts during the \r\nOlympic Truce. It begins seven days prior to the opening \r\nof the Olympic Games, and concludes on the seventh \r\nday after the closing of the Paralympic Games. The \r\nOlympic Truce ensures the safe passage of the athletes \r\nand all other Olympic-accredited personnel when \r\nthey travel to and from the Olympic Games. The draft \r\nresolution also signifies the Assembly’s strong wish \r\nthat the Pyeongchang Games will provide a window \r\nof opportunity to foster an environment conducive to \r\nbuilding and sustaining peace on the Korean peninsula \r\nin North-East Asia.\r\nThe Olympic Truce is about the promotion of peace \r\nthrough sport. We Koreans still vividly remember the \r\n1988 Seoul Olympic Games — an exemplary case of \r\npromoting peace by bringing East and West together. \r\nThe 2000 Sydney Summer Olympic Games was another \r\ngood example in that regard. With strong support from \r\nthe International Olympic Committee, the delegations \r\nof both Koreas walked into the Olympic stadium during \r\nthe opening ceremony, marching together hand-in-hand \r\nunder the same flag.\r\nThose two events demonstrated the power of sport, \r\nwhich unites people. It is my strong belief that we \r\nshould and can continue that tradition. I believe that \r\nthe Olympic Games represent the best expression of \r\nour values translated into action. Since 2004, we have \r\nbeen running our own Olympic Truce programmes so \r\nas to emphasize the importance of the Olympic Truce \r\nMovement in tandem with the Olympic values of \r\nexcellence, friendship and respect. For the past 14 years, \r\nGangwon province, which is the regional Government \r\nof the host city of Pyeongchang, has welcomed more \r\nthan 1,900 young students from 83 countries. Through \r\nthe Pyeongchang Dream Programme, it has provided \r\nyoung participants from developing countries, or \r\ncountries with no winter season and no winter-sport \r\nfacilities, with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to \r\nexperience and enjoy winter sports. I am very happy to \r\ninform the Assembly that two participants in the Dream \r\nProgramme have become Olympians in Olympic \r\nWinter Games. In addition, seven other participants \r\nhave represented their countries in the Youth Olympic \r\nGames. We have also directly engaged more than \r\n6 million students through various school visits and \r\ncultural activities since 2014. The online educational \r\ncomponent is currently accessible to all young Koreans \r\nand will remain open even after the Games in order \r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 3/28\r\nto continue to promote peace and the Olympic ideals. \r\nMoreover, we have held numerous activities, such as \r\nthe National Model United Nations Conference and \r\nother special programmes, to encourage young people \r\nto engage in dialogues on the topics of peace and \r\nreconciliation. More than 1 million students from many \r\ncountries have participated in our peace initiatives, of \r\nwhich we are very proud.\r\nOn this occasion, I would like to welcome three \r\nKorean high-school students who have participated \r\nin our programmes. They are here with us today to \r\nrepresent the young people of Korea and their desire for \r\na peaceful Olympic Games. As International Olympic \r\nCommittee President Thomas Bach has reiterated, no \r\nother event brings the entire world together like the \r\nOlympic Games. Against that background, during a \r\nplenary meeting of the General Assembly in September, \r\nPresident Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea \r\nexpressed his commitment to peace on the Korean \r\npeninsula and his earnest desire for it (see A/72/PV.11). \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to assure Member \r\nStates once again that we, the Organizing Committee \r\nfor the Olympic Games, together with the Korean \r\nGovernment, are committed to ensuring a secure and \r\npeaceful Olympic Games so that everyone can feel safe \r\nand comfortable throughout their stay.\r\nThe Pyeongchang Games will be the first of three \r\nconsecutive Olympic and Paralympic Games in North-\r\nEast Asia. Our partners and friends from Tokyo 2020 \r\nand Beijing 2022 will also stand before the Assembly \r\nto support the draft resolution. We Koreans hope that \r\nthose three Olympic Games will provide a window \r\nof opportunity for promoting peace and economic \r\ncooperation in North-East Asia. We hope that our \r\njoint action today will lead to a chain reaction for the \r\npromotion of peace within the region and beyond. \r\nTogether we are more powerful than any one of us \r\nworking alone.\r\nI would like to emphasize that the values of peace \r\nand sport go hand in hand with the Olympics. We \r\nwant to share that message as we aim to open up new \r\nhorizons for sport. On behalf of the Government and \r\nthe people of the Republic of Korea, the host city of \r\nPyeongchang and the Organizing Committee, I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening this plenary meeting, and to cordially ask \r\nthat the Assembly support the draft resolution before \r\nit today.\r\nThe President: Before proceeding further, as \r\nmentioned in my letter dated 8 November, I should like \r\nto consult members with a view to inviting Ms. Kim \r\nYuna, Olympic gold medallist in figure skating and \r\nGoodwill Ambassador for the 2018 Pyeongchang \r\nOlympic and Paralympic Winter Games, to make a \r\nstatement on this occasion.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly, without setting a precedent, to invite \r\nMs. Kim Yuna to make a statement at this meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision \r\njust taken, I now give the f loor to Ms. Kim Yuna, \r\nOlympic gold medallist in figure skating and Goodwill \r\nAmbassador for the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic and \r\nParalympic Winter Games.\r\nMs. Kim Yuna: I would like to thank the President \r\nof the General Assembly and Member States for giving \r\nme this opportunity to address the Assembly this \r\nmorning on the role of sport and the Olympic ideal in \r\npromoting peace.\r\nAs a former figure skater, a two-time Olympian \r\nand a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, I stand proudly \r\nbefore Member States as Honorary Ambassador for the \r\nPyeongchang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter \r\nGames to share my personal experience in witnessing \r\nthe power of sport in breaking down the walls of race, \r\nregion, language and religion all around the world.\r\nOne hundred and twenty-three years ago, the father \r\nof the modern Olympics, Pierre de Coubertin, said that \r\nthe Olympic spirit is not the property of any one race or \r\none age. We might want to add today that the Olympic \r\nspirit is not the exclusive property of any one nation or \r\nregion of the world or of any one religion or faith. The \r\nOlympic Charter now states that the goal of Olympism \r\nis to place sport at the service of the harmonious \r\ndevelopment of humankind, with a view to promoting \r\na peaceful society concerned with the preservation of \r\nhuman dignity. I strongly believe that that is the spirit of \r\nthe Olympic Games and that it represents the potential \r\nand the power of sport.\r\nI first experienced the same spirit and power as a \r\n10-year-old child watching the South and North Korean \r\ndelegations walk into the Olympic stadium together in \r\n2000. Today I hope to witness that power again as the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopts draft resolution A/72/L.5.\r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n4/28 17-37640\r\nI firmly believe that the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic \r\nand Paralympic Winter Games will help to spread the \r\nmessage of peace through one of the few languages that \r\nhas the power to unite people around the world — the \r\ngraceful and universal language of sport. Pyeongchang \r\nrepresents perhaps the most sincere effort to cross \r\nthe frozen border between the South and the North \r\nand to foster a peaceful environment. In particular, \r\nI am confident that the upcoming Pyeongchang 2018 \r\nOlympic and Paralympic Winter Games will be one of \r\nthe best possible platforms not only for transmitting \r\nthat message but also for sharing the Olympic spirit of \r\npeace for humankind with the entire world.\r\nI would like to promise to everyone that I will do \r\nmy best to help Pyeongchang 2018 serve as the model \r\nfor a successful Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games \r\nfor all the years to come. In turn, I would like to ask \r\nfor the continued support of the Assembly to help to \r\nbuild the legacy of Pyeongchang for the benefit of all \r\nfuture Olympic and Paralympic Games and the spirit of \r\nworld peace. I humbly ask Member States to continue \r\nto support the Pyeongchang Olympic and Paralympic \r\nWinter Games and the ideals of the Olympic Truce \r\nMovement. I hope to see members again next year \r\nin Pyeongchang.\r\nMs. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): For \r\nthe twenty-third time, the Olympic and Paralympic \r\nWinter Games will open in February. The world’s \r\nattention will be focused on the opening ceremonies \r\nand the 15 disciplines of the Pyeongchang Games in \r\nthe Republic of Korea. For the fifty-second time, the \r\nSummer and Winter Games will become symbols of \r\neffort, excellence and fair play. For the twelfth time, the \r\nGeneral Assembly today is calling for the observance \r\nof the Olympic Truce.\r\nAllow me to warmly congratulate our friends from \r\nthe Republic of Korea delegation for the draft resolution \r\n(A/72/L.5) that was just introduced to the General \r\nAssembly, which we will adopt by acclamation. The \r\nPrincipality of Monaco is proud to be a co-author of \r\nthat text, which is an affirmation of our belief that \r\nsport and the Olympic ideal can build a peaceful and \r\nbetter world.\r\nThe call to respect the Olympic Truce represents \r\nmore than just a powerful symbol of peace. The titles \r\nof the agenda item and of draft resolution are directly \r\ninspired by the values that are supported and promoted \r\nby the Olympic Movement. That is no coincidence, given \r\nthat the Movement brings together the International \r\nOlympic Committee, 206 National Olympic \r\nCommittees, the International Sport Federation, the \r\nvarious Organizing Committees of the Olympic Games \r\nand all people who adhere to the values  of the Olympic \r\nCharter. The Olympic Movement has unique reach.\r\nIt seems particularly important today to recall that \r\nOlympism and its values, as enshrined in the Olympic \r\nCharter, are in line with the principles and ideals that \r\ntranscend our work in this forum and are enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Let us not forget that \r\nOlympism is also, and perhaps even first and foremost, \r\na philosophy of life — a balance between the qualities \r\nof the body, will and spirit. Humanity, dignity and the \r\nrejection of all forms of discrimination are fundamental \r\nprinciples of Olympism.\r\nThe United Nations, like the Olympic Movement, \r\nhas ambitious agendas with universal and converging \r\nprinciples. Our Heads of State and Government \r\nadopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand recognized that sport, because of its cross-cutting \r\nnature, can make a significant contribution to the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda. The Olympic \r\nMovement is equipped with the Olympic Agenda 2020, \r\nwhich is based on good governance and ethics. Those \r\nprinciples are essential because the Olympic Games are \r\nthe global showcase of the Olympic ideal. In addition, \r\nthe promotion of human rights is intrinsic to the Games.\r\nAt the ninth forum and fifth assembly of European \r\nathletes, held in Monaco in October, His Serene \r\nHighness Prince Albert II stated that athletes are at the \r\nheart of the Olympic Movement and that their protection \r\nis of the utmost importance in the Agenda 2020. Let \r\nus acknowledge that the actions of the International \r\nOlympic Committee are of even greater significance. \r\nThe commitment of the Committee, which becomes \r\napparent to the world every two years, is constant \r\nand requires all the energy and work of its President, \r\nmembers and all those who adhere to the principles of \r\nthe Olympic Charter and embody and promote them on \r\na daily basis.\r\nEducation, health, inclusion, gender equality, \r\nempowerment, tolerance and respect, among other \r\nthings, are part of the Olympic values  that contribute to \r\nthe achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs). In February 2018, tens of millions of people \r\nwill turn their attention to the Republic of Korea, which \r\nwill mark the opening of a six-year Olympic sequence \r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 5/28\r\nin Asia, with subsequent Games to take place in Tokyo \r\nin 2020 and Beijing in 2022.\r\nThe Olympic f lag and the United Nations f lag will \r\nsoon be f lown together again at the Pyeongchang site \r\nand will complement the Olympic rings and torch, \r\nsymbols of our common future. We strongly believe \r\nin the power of sport and its unique ability to unite. \r\nThat is why the draft resolution reflects our shared \r\nhope that the Games provide an opportunity, as its \r\nthirteenth preambular paragraph states, “to foster \r\nan atmosphere of peace, development, tolerance and \r\nunderstanding on the Korean peninsula and in North-\r\nEast Asia”. We look forward to the series of athletic \r\nachievements broadcast by the Olympic Channel, \r\nwhich will send a strong positive message. In our day-\r\nto-day life, where mistrust sometimes takes precedence \r\nover seeking mutual understanding, sport is a powerful \r\nlanguage and promotes respect for the rules that apply \r\nto everyone equally.\r\nHaving come through their qualifying events, the \r\nathletes will soon compete under the motto “Faster, \r\nHigher, Stronger”. They will thrill and inspire us with \r\ntheir self-denial, efforts, perseverance and the humility \r\nthat they show in the long and difficult journey that \r\nleads them to the Games. Qualifying for the Games \r\nrepresents the culmination of years of sacrifice. It also \r\nmeans undergoing a transformation from being merely \r\nan athlete into an Olympian, with the corresponding \r\nresponsibilities. Being an Olympian means that one’s \r\nduties go beyond just giving one’s best. The Olympians \r\nwill be the focus of rapt attention from their countries \r\nand communities, and their actions and gestures will be \r\nopen to all and analysed.\r\nLike Olympians, we owe it to ourselves to inspire \r\nthe young people we invoke so often in our speeches and \r\ndeliberations on peace, conflict prevention, respect for \r\nhuman rights and the implementation of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment agenda. We must ensure that the Olympic \r\nTruce is respected. Let us ensure that the efforts of the \r\nGames will be an appropriate expression of our hopes \r\nand that they will blur our differences. Let us embrace \r\nthe Olympic values together and let the youth of the \r\nworld help us build a future of peace and brotherhood.\r\nLike the athletes who are the ambassadors of \r\nOlympism, we bear a significant responsibility, \r\nentrusted as we are with the task of representing our \r\nStates in the United Nations. The Olympic spirit should \r\ntherefore enliven us in our every action at the service of \r\nour States and multilateralism.\r\nBy making the motto “Faster, Higher, Stronger” \r\nour own, we can give ourselves the means to achieve \r\nthe Goals that our Heads of State and Government \r\nadopted in the 2030 Agenda faster. We will aim higher \r\nin our cooperation efforts. We will be stronger together \r\nand truly united for a better world for all of humankind. \r\nI hope that the Olympic and Paralympic Games in \r\nPyeongchang will be remembered as the Games of \r\nunderstanding and friendship between peoples who are \r\nunited by the power of sport.\r\nMs. Velichko (Belarus): (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe delegation of Belarus welcomes draft resolution \r\nA/72/L.5, of which Belarus is a sponsor, on building \r\na peaceful and better world through sport. One of its \r\nkey elements is a call to Member States to observe the \r\nOlympic Truce under the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nWe hope that the draft resolution will serve not only as \r\na reminder of the wonderful ancient Greek tradition of \r\nceasing hostilities during the Olympic Games, but also \r\nas a call to action for all States.\r\nWe hope that in the current context of international \r\ninstability, the upcoming Olympic Games will facilitate \r\nthe promotion of the value of peace, in accordance with \r\nthe fundamental principles of the Olympic Charter. \r\nWe support the efforts of the International Olympic \r\nCommittee and the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees to facilitate the \r\nparticipation of teams of refugees in the Games. The \r\ndevelopment of physical capability through sport is a \r\nkey area of Belarus’s national policy.\r\nBelarus is proud that it has earned the right to host \r\nan important European competition in 2019, the second \r\nEuropean Games. We firmly condemn any attempt \r\nto exploit sport for political gains. We advocate for \r\nthe preservation of the independence and autonomy \r\nof sport, as well as the principle of equality before \r\nthe law and the preservation of the values and ethics \r\nof sport. We are confident that the draft resolution to \r\nbe adopted today will help strengthen the role of sport \r\nin promoting peace and development, strengthening \r\nthe principles of tolerance and respect and enhancing \r\nmutual understanding among States and peoples in the \r\nspirit of true Olympism based on friendship, solidarity \r\nand fair play without discrimination.\r\nMr. Alduwaisan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nMy country is pleased to be participating in the \r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n6/28 17-37640\r\ndeliberations on this agenda item, as we firmly \r\nbelieve in the importance of sport in solidly grounding \r\nsocieties and relations among peoples and of educating \r\nour youth well in that area. We also reaffirm our \r\nsupport for resolution 67/296, adopted in August \r\n2013, in accordance with which Member States, \r\nthe United Nations system, relevant international \r\norganizations, civil society and the public and private \r\nsector should cooperate, observe and raise awareness \r\nof the International Day of Sport for Development and \r\nPeace. We therefore reiterate the need to invest in our \r\nyoung people, so as to build a better society through \r\nprogrammes and plans of action aimed at helping them \r\nto embrace noble principles and at combating crime, \r\nextremism and corruption. Those ambitions cannot be \r\nrealized unless we use the institutions that have been \r\ndeveloped within our societies.\r\nThe language of sport and athletes has always been \r\none of peace, security and solidarity in confronting \r\nviolence and extremism. In the case of two of the fiercest \r\nmilitary adversaries in the First World War, soccer \r\nbrought together soldiers from both sides for a day. The \r\nresults that we could achieve in times of peace through \r\nthe same means are limited only by our imagination. \r\nAnother model example that promoted peace across \r\nthe African continent was aimed at combating racism \r\nwhen, through sport, the South African leader Nelson \r\nMandela conveyed a message at the 1995 Rugby World \r\nCup, hosted by South Africa, in order to unify the \r\nchildren of his people and combat apartheid.\r\nIn 1894, when Coubertin re-established the modern \r\nOlympic Games, he believed in the importance of \r\nsport as a form of spiritual energy and promoted that \r\nphilosophy so as to spread love and peace among peoples \r\nthrough the Games. In that same vein, he established \r\nthe principles of the Games, whereby participation and \r\nfair play, rather than winning, were to be the key goals.\r\nThe Olympic Movement brings to life the principles \r\nof the Olympic Charter, as well as peace and human \r\ndignity, thereby fostering development. The example \r\nand experience of the Olympic Games provide us with \r\nan opportunity to reflect on the power of sport to unite \r\nus, the best illustration of which is the concept of the \r\nOlympic Village, which brings athletes from more than \r\n200 States together in one place. The guiding principal \r\nof the Olympic ideal is that sport is synonymous with \r\npeace, and is almost magically reflected in efforts to \r\npromote peace and development.\r\nIn conclusion, within the framework of the United \r\nNations we see today many similarities between the \r\nprinciples of our Organization and the International \r\nOlympic Committee in their parallel efforts aimed \r\nat promoting peace through sport. The most striking \r\nexample of such cooperation and solidarity was the \r\nsupport provided for a group of refugee athletes — a \r\nfirst-of-a-kind moment in the history of the Olympic \r\nGames — when in Rio de Janeiro more than 10 young \r\nathletes participated in the 2016 Games and were given \r\nan opportunity to move beyond war and conflicts.\r\nMs. Wong (Singapore): On behalf of my delegation, \r\nI would like to express our sincere condolences for the \r\nlives lost as a result of the earthquake that affected Iran \r\nand Iraq this past weekend. Our thoughts and prayers \r\nare with the victims and their loved ones.\r\nSingapore is pleased to co-sponsor draft resolution \r\nA/72/L.5, entitled, “Sport for development and peace: \r\nbuilding a peaceful and better world through sport and \r\nthe Olympic ideal”, under agenda item 11. Singapore \r\nthanks the Republic of Korea for its successful efforts \r\nin coordinating the draft resolution, which recognizes \r\nthe ideals represented by the Olympic Truce, and we \r\nlook forward to its adoption by consensus in the General \r\nAssembly today.\r\nThe practice and goal of perfection in sport \r\nrepresent a force for good in many societies. The values \r\nof hard work and self-discipline and the determination \r\nto do better inspire the human spirit. Sport brings \r\ntogether people of various origins, creeds, cultures \r\nand nationalities, and enhances mutual understanding \r\nthrough a spirit of friendship and fair play. That is \r\nthe spirit of the Olympic Games, which, since the \r\nfirst modern Olympic Games, in 1896, has not only \r\nsymbolized the pinnacle of achievement in sports, \r\nbut also plays a crucial role in bridging communities \r\nand promoting tolerance, social inclusion, peace, \r\ncooperation and sustainable development.\r\nSingapore recognizes the importance of sport \r\nin everyday life. Nationally, sport can bring together \r\ndiverse groups of people in a spirit of solidarity and \r\nimbue them with a greater sense of pride in their \r\ncountry. At the community level, sport helps to bring \r\nabout better health outcomes. Our Government has \r\ntherefore actively promoted sports in Singapore. \r\nActiveSG, a national sport movement, was launched to \r\nencourage Singaporeans to become active by providing \r\naccess to affordable and exciting sports activities \r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 7/28\r\nand programmes. In addition, to ensure that sport in \r\nSingapore remains an inclusive activity, the disability \r\nsports master plan was launched in 2016 to ensure that \r\npersons with disabilities are able to participate and \r\nexcel in sport if they so wish. Recognizing that areas \r\nintended for sport are not only places for training but \r\nalso common spaces for people to gather and connect \r\nwith one another, we have also set up a master plan for \r\nsports facilities to provide greater access to a network \r\nof sports amenities and enable people to live better \r\nthrough sport.\r\nWe are glad to see that some of our efforts have paid \r\noff. At the Rio de Janeiro Paralympic Games in 2016, \r\nthe Singapore team did us proud by achieving our best-\r\never result of two gold and one silver medal, won by \r\nParalympian swimmers Yip Pin Xiu and Theresa Goh, \r\nrespectively. The year 2016 was also a milestone for \r\nus, as our swimmer Joseph Schooling won Singapore’s \r\nfirst ever Olympic gold medal. Those achievements \r\nshow that success knows no boundaries. Individuals \r\nfrom any country can succeed if they put their minds to \r\nit and work hard for their goals.\r\nThe benefits of sport also transcend national \r\nboundaries. Sport can help to promote closer ties and \r\nfriendships among neighbours and beyond. As part \r\nof our ongoing contributions to sporting events in the \r\nregion, Singapore hosted the twenty-eighth Southeast \r\nAsian Games and the eighth Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) Para Games in 2015. Our \r\nathletes participated actively in the recent twenty-ninth \r\nSoutheast Asian Games and ninth ASEAN Para Games, \r\nheld in Kuala Lumpur. We are glad to see the many \r\ntransnational friendships and inspiring personal stories \r\nof athletes that emerged during those events. We look \r\nforward to supporting and participating in the series of \r\nsuccessive Olympic and Paralympic Games to be held \r\nin North-East Asia, and hope that they will serve as \r\navenues to promote peace, dialogue and reconciliation.\r\nJust as Baron de Coubertin, the creator of the \r\nmodern Olympic Games, once said,\r\n“[t]he most important thing in the Olympic Games \r\nis not to win but to take part. The essential thing is \r\nnot to have conquered but to have fought well”.\r\nSport inspires a nobler human spirit and is an enabler \r\nof individuals and communities. The 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development has recognized the role \r\nof sport in the realization of development and peace \r\nand in the promotion of tolerance, respect and the \r\nempowerment of women and young people, as well as its \r\nmany contributions to health, education and our goals \r\nof social inclusion. Let us continue to uphold the spirit \r\nof the Olympic Truce and aim to build a sustainable, \r\ninclusive and prosperous future for our peoples.\r\nMs. Mohamed Didi (Maldives): The Olympic \r\nMovement is a celebration of humankind and human \r\nvalues. Sport has the power to inspire and energize \r\nhuman development, and the Olympic ideal has helped \r\nto create equality and a level-playing field to bring out \r\nthe best in humankind. The Maldives is proud to be an \r\nactive participant in the Olympic Movement. Maldivian \r\nathletes took the great leap forward by participating in \r\nthe Olympic Games for the first time in 1988. It was truly \r\na once-in-a-lifetime moment, not only for those who \r\nparticipated, but for future generations of youth who \r\nwere inspired by the ideals of the Olympic Movement to \r\nbuild a peaceful and better world through sport.\r\nThe Olympic Movement has an extraordinary \r\nability to give hope and renew aspirations precisely \r\nwhen one is faced with difficult challenges. The \r\nparticipation of an Olympic team of refugees during \r\nthe 2016 Summer Olympics Games in Rio de Janeiro \r\nmade history and gave optimism, courage and faith \r\nto millions of refugees around the world. Not only \r\ndid those athletes help foster hope for millions of \r\npeople facing unimaginable barriers in reaching their \r\naspirations, it showed the world that through sport no \r\nbarrier is insurmountable.\r\nMy delegation commends that initiative, which \r\nreflects the human connections among communities \r\nthat transcend boundaries. The President of the \r\nMaldives, Mr. Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom, has \r\nprioritized youth development and empowerment \r\nthrough opportunities that will unleash their creativity \r\nand enable them to realize their full potential. That will \r\nallow them to aim higher, dream bigger and dream new \r\ndreams. Sport development is, of course, a significant \r\ncomponent of youth development. The Maldives enacted \r\nits first sport bill in September 2015. The legislation \r\naims to assist in the promotion of competitive sports \r\nand cultural activities at the international, national and \r\nlocal levels. It also outlines policies and guidelines \r\nfor facilitating sports development with community-\r\nlevel participation.\r\nThe Maldives recognizes the important role that \r\nsport plays in peace and security. That is why we \r\npioneered the implementation of Security Council \r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n8/28 17-37640\r\nresolution 2250 (2015), on improving programmes \r\nfor youth. The Ministry of Youth and Sport of the \r\nMaldives, in collaboration with the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme in the Maldives, held an \r\nofficial ceremony in the Maldives in August 2016 to \r\nlaunch the implementation of the resolution, becoming \r\nthe first country to do so in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\nThe Government of the Maldives continues to \r\nmake significant investments in sport infrastructure. \r\nSuch projects are designed for young people to develop \r\ntheir leadership skills and to provide them with \r\nsupport networks outside their homes. We have also \r\nsuccessfully conducted sport festivals that aim to create \r\npeace and harmony within society. The Government \r\npromotes the inclusion of women by giving them \r\ngreater opportunities, and has been encouraging female \r\nparticipation in sport so as to challenge traditional \r\ngender stereotypes.\r\nIt will be vital to empower our growing populations \r\nof young people to be active citizens in their \r\ncommunities, where they can foster economic and social \r\nprogress. Sport programmes, coordinated by the United \r\nNations, Government agencies and non-governmental \r\norganizations, have been found to facilitate sustainable \r\ndevelopment and peaceful coexistence. It is therefore \r\nencouraging to see the role of sport in peace and \r\ndevelopment reflected in all of the 17 goals in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, and to see that in \r\naction in countries around the world.\r\nOne of the most important and enduring lessons \r\nsport offers is building resilience even in the face of \r\nenormous challenges. Sport is not a panacea for all \r\nsocietal problems, nor can it resolve all global conflicts. \r\nNonetheless, for those who have lost their way, sport \r\ncan provide a sense of purpose, joy amid sorrow and \r\nhope in the face of despair.\r\nMs. Fisher-tsin (Israel): We welcome the \r\nupcoming adoption of draft resolution A/72/L.5, \r\nentitled “Building a peaceful and better world through \r\nsport and the Olympic ideal”, of which Israel is proud \r\nto be a sponsor.\r\nSport and peace are intertwined. Sport encourages \r\nteamwork, which extends well beyond the field, teaches \r\ntolerance, which extends beyond the court, and builds \r\nfriendships that last far longer than those crucial final \r\nseconds of overtime. Israel believes that sport is a key \r\ningredient in coexistence and goodwill. Sport is crucial \r\nfor rebinding communities. It builds inclusive societies \r\nand empowers young people, women and persons with \r\ndisabilities to achieve what they are capable of. Sport \r\nlays the groundwork for peace and prosperity for all.\r\nAs a country in a conflict-ridden region, Israel \r\nmakes a point of ensuring that all young people learn to \r\nplay on the same team. Mifalot Chinuch is an initiative \r\nfounded by Hapoel Tel Aviv, one of Israel’s biggest \r\nfootball clubs. Its goal is to see football not just as a \r\ngame but rather as a great uniting force — a universal \r\nlanguage and a common shared culture. Mifalot \r\nChinuch programmes provide an effective platform for \r\nbuilding bridges between Israelis and Palestinians, and \r\nfor seeing each other as teammates, not as the other. \r\nThrough teamwork, the hope for peace grows, one \r\nscored goal at a time.\r\nThat educational model has extended beyond \r\nthe borders of Israel to local communities across the \r\nworld, including in Cambodia, Rwanda, Jordan, Haiti \r\nand India. In Cambodia, Mifalot Chinuch established \r\na programme for the empowerment of young women \r\nthrough sport entitled Levelling the Playing Field. Once \r\nagain, through sport, girls gain the confidence and \r\ntraining to become tomorrow’s agents of change, achieve \r\ngender equality and give back to their communities.\r\nMifalot Chinuch is just one example of the \r\nremarkable ability of sport to build peace. This past \r\nMay, Israel spearheaded a local sport-for-peace effort in \r\nNigeria entitled “Israel Cares Kids’ Football League.” \r\nThe initiative targeted children aged 8 to 12 who \r\nhad been displaced from their homes by the terrorist \r\norganization Boko Haram. Israel provided uniforms, \r\nballs and coaches for the programme, giving over 200 \r\nchildren an outlet that provided trust, safety and calm. \r\nTheir participation in sport offers a sense of belonging \r\nand a new group of friends, while also restoring hope \r\nfor peace.\r\nSport should be used as a tool to unite, not divide. \r\nIt should be used to create inclusion, not exclusion or \r\npoliticization. The lessons of sport have the power to \r\nthrow a wrench into the seemingly endless cycle of \r\nconflict around our world. By giving every man, woman \r\nand child full and equal access to sport, we grow closer \r\nto a peaceful future for all.\r\nMr. Sharifuddin (Brunei Darussalam): Brunei \r\nDarussalam fully supports the discussions under \r\ntoday’s agenda item. We are also pleased to once again \r\nbe a sponsor of draft resolution A/72/L.5.\r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 9/28\r\nWe join others today in giving due recognition \r\nto the role that sport plays in development and peace \r\nand in advancing social progress. We are pleased that \r\nthat is enshrined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, specifically in its paragraph 37, which \r\nrecognizes sport as an important enabler of sustainable \r\ndevelopment that promotes tolerance and respect and \r\ncontributes to the empowerment of women, young \r\npeople, individuals and communities, as well as to \r\neducation and social inclusion objectives.\r\nWe believe that sport is a powerful tool in the \r\npromotion and advancement of peace and harmony. \r\nThat is evident, as sport leads to healthier lifestyles, \r\nmore interaction, friendship and community-building.\r\nWe should especially encourage our young people to \r\nparticipate in sport programmes, events and exchanges, \r\nwhich can promote mutual trust and respect, tolerance \r\nand a greater appreciation of other cultures and ways \r\nof life, and can also forge lasting bonds of friendship. \r\nInstilling such shared values and ideals is important \r\nto young people’s development. Sport can also act as \r\na positive outlet for countering the various challenges \r\nthat many of our youth face today, such as drug abuse, \r\nviolent extremism and high levels of unemployment.\r\nBrunei Darussalam continues to emphasize \r\nthe positive contribution of sport to socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment. Under our national policy, sport is a means \r\nof enhancing the quality of life and building a healthy \r\nnation. It also goes hand in hand with our National \r\nVision 2035, which aspires to create a well-educated \r\nand highly skilled society with an improved quality of \r\nlife, as well as a dynamic and sustainable economy.\r\nThe development of sport remains a high priority for \r\nthe Government of Brunei Darussalam, and significant \r\ninvestment has been made to provide sport with \r\nadequate recreational infrastructure so as to promote \r\nthe creation of a healthy and active community.\r\nIntegral to that endeavour is inclusive, \r\nmulti-stakeholder collaboration between the public \r\nand private sectors, as well as among national sporting \r\nbodies. One such project is the My Happy City initiative, \r\nwhereby every Sunday the capital city is designated as a \r\ncar-free zone for people to engage in sporting activities \r\nsuch as cycling, running and aerobics. It brings together \r\nsport enthusiasts of all ages and abilities, irrespective \r\nof their social background or economic status. Not only \r\nhas the initiative contributed to reviving our capital as a \r\ncentre for community, sporting, commercial and tourist \r\nactivities, it has also promoted healthy lifestyles and a \r\nsporting culture among the people. That is in line with \r\nthe vision for world health of the Director-General of \r\nthe World Health Organization.\r\nAt the same time, while recognizing sport’s \r\ncontributions to the empowerment of people, we are \r\nalso taking steps to train and develop quality athletes, \r\nincluding women and persons with disabilities, who can \r\ncompete at the local, regional and international levels. \r\nOur participation in various regional and international \r\nsporting events, such as the Olympic Games, the \r\nCommonwealth Games, the Islamic Solidarity Games, \r\nthe Asian Games and the Southeast Asian Games, has \r\nhelped our athletes strive for excellence and bring \r\nsporting achievements and recognition to our country. \r\nMoreover, such participation has enabled our athletes \r\nto foster friendships with other athletes, thereby \r\npromoting better understanding, respect and tolerance \r\nof other cultures. All of those are values that contribute \r\nto peace.\r\nIn conclusion, Brunei Darussalam is firmly \r\ncommitted to working with other Member States and \r\nrelated regional and international bodies in advancing \r\nsport, particularly as such activities contribute to the \r\nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nMs. Al-Abdulla (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I should \r\nlike to thank the President for convening today’s \r\nmeeting under agenda item 11.\r\nWe align ourselves with the statements delivered by \r\nthe sponsors of draft resolution A/72/L.5, on building \r\na peaceful and better world through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideals.\r\nThe draft resolution reflects Qatar’s conviction that \r\nsport has the power to strengthen education, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, peace, cooperation and solidarity at all \r\nlevels. By fostering peace and reflecting and embodying \r\nthe role of sport, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment also highlights sport as a means of \r\nachieving sustainable development. Given the fact that \r\nsport plays a role in encouraging tolerance, respect and \r\nthe empowerment of women and individuals, Qatar \r\naccords particular importance to sport at the national, \r\nregional and international levels. We have successfully \r\nhosted a number of sporting events, such as the Asian \r\nGames in 2006. The Ministry of Culture, Arts and \r\nHeritage considers that sport can be used in order to \r\ndevelop peace. We also hope to host the International \r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n10/28 17-37640\r\nFootball Federation World Cup in 2022, which would \r\nbe the first time that our region hosted such an event.\r\nI would like to point out the key role that our \r\nMinistry of Culture, Arts and Heritage has played in \r\npreparing Qatar to host the World Cup through the \r\npromotion of peace and mutual understanding, based \r\non the fundamental principle of the role that sport \r\nplays in strengthening dialogue among peoples and \r\ncultures and in promoting peace and development. \r\nSport also helps Qatar build towards its national vision \r\nfor 2030 and create a strong, healthy society, serving to \r\nstrengthen relations among the citizens of the country. \r\nWe have always supported the role that sport plays, and \r\nwe celebrate National Sports Day as a national holiday.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to highlight \r\nthe efforts of the Ministry of Youth and Sports to \r\npromote sports and the excellence of sports across the \r\ncountry. We also commend the additional efforts of the \r\nQatar Olympic Committee to facilitate the development \r\nof sport. We have in place a number of programmes and \r\ninitiatives that strive for the same objective across all \r\nlevels. Through the Qatar Olympic Committee, we have \r\nalso provided significant assistance to communities \r\nthat are in need due to various difficult circumstances \r\nacross various areas of the world.\r\nMr. Hoshino (Japan): Sport has the power to \r\nnurture dreams and bring hope to people. It has the \r\npower to change the world, and even the future of \r\nhumankind. In the spirit of peace, I hope that the \r\ninternational community will once again come together \r\nto adopt this important draft resolution on the Olympic \r\nTruce (A/72/L.5), as it has done every year since 1993.\r\nJapan appreciates the initiative and leadership of \r\nthe Republic of Korea, the host of next year’s Winter \r\nOlympic and Paralympic Games, in submitting this \r\nyear’s draft resolution. As a sponsor, Japan would like \r\nto highlight the importance of the independence and \r\nautonomy of sport and of ensuring that the Olympic and \r\nParalympic Games should be organized in the spirit of \r\npeace, mutual understanding, friendship, tolerance and \r\nthe inadmissibility of discrimination of any kind. We \r\nare grateful that those fundamental principles, drawn \r\nfrom the Olympic Charter, are reflected in the draft \r\nresolution. Japan firmly believes that next year’s games \r\nin Pyeongchang will realize those ideals and objectives.\r\nJapan will be next to host the Olympic and \r\nParalympic Games, in Tokyo in 2020. We want \r\nthe Tokyo 2020 Games to realize the three ideals \r\nof achieving personal best, unity in diversity and \r\nconnecting to tomorrow. Based on the concept of \r\nachieving one’s personal best, the Tokyo 2020 Games \r\nwill aim to deliver an event where all athletes can \r\nrealize their greatest athletic performance and achieve \r\ntheir personal best. Unity in diversity acknowledges the \r\nimportance of accepting and respecting differences so \r\nthat peace can be maintained and society continue to \r\ndevelop and f lourish. As for the concept of connecting \r\nto tomorrow, I would like to recall that the Tokyo 1964 \r\nGames were a major factor in Japan’s rapid economic \r\ngrowth at the time.\r\nWe hope that the Tokyo 2020 Games will enable \r\nJapan to promote transformative changes that can \r\nprovide an opportunity to bring hopes and dreams to \r\nthe areas affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami \r\ndisaster. We believe that showing the world the affected \r\nregion’s recovery and reconstruction will be a way of \r\nexpressing Japan’s gratitude to all those who have helped \r\nus in efforts that continue to this day. In that regard, the \r\nGovernment of Japan is promoting exchanges between \r\nthe affected areas and the world.\r\nSince 2014, in the lead-up to 2020, the Government \r\nof Japan has been steadily implementing various \r\nprojects under the programme “Sport for Tomorrow”, \r\nwhile recognizing that sport enables societal and \r\neconomic development. The programme aims to reach \r\nover 10 million people in more than 100 countries. \r\nMore specifically, we are implementing such projects \r\nas sending coaches and athletes abroad or inviting them \r\nto Japan and providing sports facilities. We believe \r\nthat such projects contribute to the realization of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals.\r\nIn conclusion, Japan will continue working to \r\npromote the sport so that the 2018 Pyeongchang \r\nGames will be a success, not only in terms of the \r\nGames themselves but also in building a spirit of peace \r\nthroughout the world. I would like to assure the General \r\nAssembly that the Tokyo 2020 Games will do the same.\r\nMs. Rodríguez Abascal (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation would like to reiterate Cuba’s continued \r\nsupport for the international community’s efforts to \r\npromote sport as a means of fostering development, \r\npeace and social inclusion. That is why we have decided \r\nto sponsor the draft resolution introduced by the \r\nRepublic of Korea under this agenda item (A/72/L.5).\r\nThe widespread practice of sport as a right to be \r\nenjoyed by all is one of the major achievements of the \r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 11/28\r\nCuban Revolution in terms of human rights. Sport, \r\nphysical education and sport-related recreational \r\nactivities reach every corner of our country, and \r\nuniversal access is guaranteed for young and old alike, \r\nincluding programmes for special-education centres and \r\nthe disabled. Cuba has trained a considerable number \r\nof specialized physical-education teachers responsible \r\nfor implementing our physical culture and health \r\ndevelopment strategy in all communities in the country, \r\nwhich has benefited all children and adolescents, young \r\npeople, women — including pregnant women — and \r\nthe elderly.\r\nCuba also has a network of sports facilities with \r\nservices in all municipalities to foster and encourage \r\nthe practice of sport. Each province in the country has a \r\nschool of physical culture, from which mid- and higher-\r\nlevel professionals in the field graduate each year. The \r\nachievements in this sector are further complemented \r\nby our specialized centres for training athletes and \r\na robust sports-medicine system, which includes a \r\nmodern anti-doping laboratory recognized by the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee, affirming Cuba’s \r\ncommitment to fighting that scourge.\r\nDespite being a small developing country, over the \r\npast 58 years Cuba has achieved sustained successes \r\nin sport at the regional and global levels. We are the \r\none hundred and sixth largest country in the world in \r\nterms of surface area, and eighty-second by population. \r\nHowever, in terms of sport we rank first in the Central \r\nAmerican and Caribbean region, second in the \r\nAmericas and, on average, eighteenth at the Olympic \r\nlevel, among more than 200 other countries.\r\nCuba’s worldwide solidarity with coaches and \r\nphysical-education teachers also enhance the prestige \r\nof Cuban sport. True to its internationalist vocation, \r\nCuba has offered to cooperate in the development of \r\nsport in many countries, and we will continue to do so \r\nto the best of our ability.\r\nAll the achievements I mentioned have been possible \r\nthanks to the political will of our Government and the \r\nactive participation of our people, despite the obstacles \r\nimposed by the criminal blockade imposed against my \r\ncountry, which has caused serious restrictions on the \r\ndevelopment of sport.\r\nFinally, Cuba reiterates its firm commitment to \r\nthe promotion of sport as a vehicle for the promotion \r\nof peace, the building of fairer and more supportive \r\nsocieties and the making of a better world for present \r\nand future generations.\r\nMrs. Theofili (Greece): Dating back to the eighth \r\ncentury before the common era, the ancient Olympic \r\nGames were a force for peace and solidarity among \r\nancient Greek city-States, which would declare a truce \r\nfor a period of seven days before the beginning and \r\nafter the end of the Games. The ultimate goal was the \r\npeaceful conduct of the Games, which was ensured by \r\nprotecting the host city from invasion and ordering \r\nindividuals and State authorities to refrain from \r\ninterfering with the safe passage of the athletes. As \r\nThucydides wrote, when States violated the truce, their \r\nathletes were banned from participating in the Games.\r\nThe concept of the Olympic Truce was born \r\nin antiquity and was respected and followed for a \r\nperiod of 1,200 years. The Greeks viewed the Games \r\nas an opportunity to replace conflict with friendly \r\ncompetition. However, the truce ideal was also of \r\ngreat importance in the revival of the Olympic Games \r\nin the modern era as an invaluable tool for advancing \r\ninternational cooperation and promote world peace.\r\nIn today’s world, an emphasis on Olympic peace \r\nhas become a major feature of modern Olympic \r\nideology. The foundation of the International Olympic \r\nTruce Centre, for the creation of which Greece actively \r\nengaged with the International Olympic Committee, \r\ngave the pursuit of peace a new dynamism. Most \r\nimportantly, the inclusion of the Olympic Truce in the \r\nUnited Nations framework through the adoption of \r\nrelevant resolutions granted a distinct role to the ideal. \r\nWe should bear in mind that, in a world of differences, \r\ninequalities and conflicts, engagement in even a \r\ntemporary truce is an achievement for the international \r\ncommunity. It is therefore our responsibility to continue \r\nto promote the Olympic Truce and spare no effort to \r\nensure its actual implementation.\r\nIn 2018, the Republic of Korea will host the \r\nPyeongchang Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. \r\nI take this opportunity to wish the Republic of Korea \r\nevery success in this demanding endeavour. For the \r\nrest of us, it is our task to fulfil our responsibilities \r\nby observing the Olympic Truce and thereby making \r\npeace an attainable goal. We should all find inspiration \r\nin next year’s Olympic Games and reflect on how sport \r\ncould be used as a useful tool to reduce tensions and \r\nbuild bridges.\r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n12/28 17-37640\r\nMr. Prasad (India): India welcomes the adoption of \r\ndraft resolution A/72/L.5, entitled “Building a peaceful \r\nand better world through sport and the Olympic ideal”, \r\nwhich is in keeping with the affirmation of Heads of \r\nState and Government in the Declaration of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development that sport is an \r\nimportant enabler of sustainable development.\r\nIf sustainable development is about promoting \r\na range of economic, social and community-based \r\noutcomes to build sustainable societies, the value of \r\nsport as a means of bringing children, and therefore \r\ntheir parents, and young people together to cooperate \r\nand participate in tackling common issues cannot be \r\nquestioned. This is in addition to its direct value in \r\npromoting the health of children and young adults, \r\nwhich itself is a key element of development.\r\nIn that context, India would like to express its \r\nappreciation for the work over the past decade of the \r\nUnited Nations Office on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace and for the valuable contribution of the Group \r\nof Friends of Sport for Development and Peace. The \r\ndesignation of 6 April as International Day of Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace has been an important marker \r\nfor emphasizing the relevance of sport to development \r\nand peace.\r\nThe spread of the Olympic movement and its \r\npopularity, as well as the immense following and \r\npopularity of national and world championships of \r\nmajor sports, such as soccer, basketball, cricket, \r\nhockey and tennis, highlight their role as celebrations \r\nof global goodwill. The stories of many sports \r\nsuperstars who have risen from poverty and destitution \r\nare powerful messages of hope and happiness to \r\nmillions of young people in the world. In turn, sports \r\nstars can become valuable messengers by spreading \r\ndevelopment messages.\r\nAs the national sport of India that reaches millions \r\nof people in cities, towns and villages in the country, \r\ncricket and its stars provide a very important platform \r\nfor spreading social messages. The greatest icon of \r\nIndian cricket, Sachin Tendulkar, illustrates this fact. \r\nTendulkar was part of a popular national campaign \r\nto promote hygiene among children that encouraged \r\nschoolchildren to wash their hands before eating food. \r\nSimilarly, he has recently been a brand ambassador for \r\nIndia’s Swachh Bharat, or Clean India, campaign.\r\nAnother Government initiative that has advanced \r\nsocial and educational development in backward areas \r\nhas been the system of sports hostels spread across the \r\ncountry. These are residential sports schools, created \r\nto take advantage of location-specific sports talent. \r\nSports hostels in eastern India, particularly in the states \r\nof Bihar and Jharkhand, have provided an educational \r\nplatform for young girls from tribal areas in the two \r\nstates. This opportunity has paid dividends not only for \r\nthe young women themselves but also for India. Today, \r\nIndia’s junior and senior women’s hockey teams are \r\ndominated by players who have emerged from those \r\ntribal areas.\r\nSport’s capacity for making a positive impact on \r\npeace and security is vividly illustrated by UNICEF’s \r\nSports for Development programme in the Sukma \r\ndistrict of the leftist insurgency-affected Indian state \r\nof Chhattisgarh, where Naxalism, the local leftist \r\ninsurgency, had become a very serious problem. The \r\nUNICEF programme, initiated in 2006—2007, was an \r\neffort to address issues arising from the civil strife in \r\nthe region, particularly with regard to children affected \r\nby violence and displacement. Implemented through \r\nkhel mitras, or sports mentors, those mentors used \r\nsports and games to connect with children so as to help \r\nthem to deal with the violence and resulting trauma and \r\nencourage them to continue going to school. This, in \r\nturn, provided the window for bringing key messages \r\nto the children and their parents on development issues \r\nand lifestyle changes. The programme’s success has \r\nseen its expansion across primary schools in the state \r\nof Chhattisgarh.\r\nI would also like to mention two innovative sport-\r\nfor-development programmes run by non-governmental \r\ninstitutions in India, which highlight the potential of \r\nsports as a community builder and contributor to \r\ndevelopment initiatives. The first is Project KHEL, \r\na programme that uses sport as a platform to help \r\nchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds to grow \r\ninto responsible and contributing members of society. \r\nWorking from Lucknow, a major city in central India, \r\nProject KHEL works with orphans, street children, \r\nchildren of migrant labourers and children from slums \r\nin a four-month-long biweekly sports and games \r\nprogramme, which focuses on building a personal \r\nsense of worth in the children and on teaching them \r\nproblem-solving skills. Specific sessions also focus on \r\nissues such as health, substance abuse, a civic sense and \r\npersonal hygiene. Today, the organization is working \r\nwith 10 partner institutions and two slum locations in \r\nthe city.\r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 13/28\r\nA similar programme in the western metropolis \r\nof Mumbai is the OSCAR Foundation, which uses \r\nfootball — soccer — to teach the value of education \r\nand life skills to underprivileged children. The specific \r\nobjective of the programme is to support children \r\nand young people in continuing in school. OSCAR’s \r\nyoung leaders work as role models and mentors for \r\nthese children.\r\nWhile organized sport is today a major source of \r\nentertainment in the world and an industry on its own, \r\nthe challenge of extending the pleasures of sport and \r\nits benefits to millions of young children in the less \r\ndeveloped and developing worlds should remain an \r\nimportant objective. India therefore sees sport as an \r\nimportant building block in creating a peaceful and \r\nbetter world and will be supportive of all efforts to \r\nspread the message of sports and development.\r\nMrs. Matar (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation would first like to thank the Republic of \r\nKorea for having submitted draft resolution A/72/L.5, \r\nwhich seeks to build a peaceful and better world \r\nthrough sport and the Olympic ideal. It is my pleasure \r\nto underscore the fact that Bahrain will support the \r\nadoption of the draft resolution out of the conviction \r\nthat sport should be used to achieve development and \r\nto promote sustainable development, peace, education, \r\ncooperation and health.\r\nThe capacity and potential of sport to cross borders \r\nand transcend language means that it is a good way to \r\nhelp settle conflicts and strengthen sustainable peace. \r\nSport is a universal phenomenon that brings people \r\ntogether and can help to build strong partnerships in a \r\nworld that is increasingly unified. This is the truth. We \r\nmust therefore protect that unity by standing together \r\nagainst hate, violence and extremism. In this regard, I \r\nwish to underscore the importance of making sure that \r\nsport serves development and peace and that it can be \r\nused to counter all forms of discrimination and hatred.\r\nWith support from the King of Bahrain, we \r\nare particularly eager to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. We believe that sport can play \r\nan important role in implementing these overarching \r\ngoals, since it can help to strengthen unity and peace. It \r\nis for this reason that 7 February is National Sports Day \r\nin Bahrain, dedicated to upholding the noble Olympic \r\nideals and promoting and practicing sport. It is our \r\ndeep conviction that sport can be used to strengthen \r\nand uphold human rights, as well as to reinforce global \r\nrespect for its values.\r\nWe believe that the active participation of people \r\nwith special needs is one way that we can achieve equal \r\nrights. We therefore want to fully support athletes with \r\nspecial needs to participate in events geared especially \r\nto them, for example, basketball.\r\nWe have been able to carry out activities related to \r\nsport in many areas under the auspices of our Ministry of \r\nYouth and Sports and the Bahrain Olympic Committee, \r\nwhich is part of the comprehensive efforts of Bahrain’s \r\nDeputy Prime Minister. We have been able to deliver \r\non all of those ideals through active participation in \r\nsporting competitions at the regional and international \r\nlevels, which includes the participation of women and \r\ndisabled individuals.\r\nIn conclusion, the Kingdom of Bahrain wishes to \r\nunderscore the importance of sport and its important \r\nrole in achieving sustainable development, respect for \r\nall, the empowerment of women and the promotion of \r\nhealth, education and social integration and inclusion.\r\nMr. Louati (Tunisia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto express my sincere thanks to the Permanent Mission \r\nof the Republic of Korea for its commendable and \r\nsuccessful efforts aimed at facilitating draft resolution \r\nA/72/L.5, entitled “Building a peaceful and better \r\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal”. Tunisia \r\nwelcomes the forthcoming adoption of this important \r\ndraft resolution, which is a testament to the crucial \r\nrole of sport in achieving peace and development. My \r\ndelegation has been a sponsor of the draft resolution \r\nsince the beginning of the process.\r\nI would liek to recall that Tunisia and Monaco, as \r\nChairs of the Group of Friends of Sport for Development \r\nand Peace, are committed to promoting all initiatives \r\nthat support the role of sport in building a better word \r\nfor humankind. Furthermore, at the national level, \r\nthe promotion of sport is an important component of \r\nTunisian development policy.\r\nAs we struggle to implement the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, it is our strong belief \r\nthat sport is an effective way to help to realize the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, particularly regarding \r\nthe promotion of education, health, women and youth \r\nempowerment, social inclusion and peace. In this \r\nregard, let me recall that sport is recognized as an \r\nimportant enabler for sustainable development in \r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n14/28 17-37640\r\nthe 2030 Agenda, particularly through its growing \r\ncontribution to the realization of development and \r\npeace, its promotion of tolerance and respect and the \r\ncontribution it makes to the empowerment of women \r\nand young people, individuals and communities. It \r\nalso contributes to the 2030 Agenda’s objectives in \r\nrelation to health, education and social inclusion. We \r\nare all aware of the power of sport as an important \r\nenabler of tolerance and understanding among peoples \r\nand nations.\r\nRecognizing the essential nature of the Olympic \r\nTruce ideal in fostering peace, Tunisia underscores the \r\nimportance of cooperation among Members States in \r\nimplementing the draft resolution so as to realize the \r\nvalues of the Olympic Truce around the world. I would \r\nalso like to acknowledge the valuable contribution of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee and the International \r\nParalympic Committee to the promotion of peace and \r\nhuman understanding through sport and the Olympic \r\nideal, which also contributes to the fulfilment of the \r\nobjectives of the United Nations. Finally, I take this \r\nopportunity to wish the Republic of Korea every success \r\nin organizing the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic \r\nWinter Games in 2018.\r\nThe President: In accordance with resolution 64/3, \r\nof 19 October 2009, I now call on the President of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee.\r\nMr. Bach (International Olympic Committee): I \r\nam grateful for this opportunity to address the General \r\nAssembly once again. Today is an important time to \r\nreaffirm the values on which both the United Nations and \r\nthe International Olympic Committee (IOC) are built. \r\nI would like to very warmly thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor having emphasized these shared values in such an \r\nimpressive way earlier this morning.\r\nI would also like to thank the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Korea for submitting the Olympic Truce \r\ndraft resolution (A/72/L.5) ahead of the 2018 Olympic \r\nWinter Games to be held in Pyeongchang. I thank the \r\nChairs of the Group of Friends of Sport for Development \r\nand Peace, Monaco and Tunisia, for all their efforts in \r\nthis process. My gratitude also extends to the many \r\nMember States that have already shown their support \r\nfor the draft resolution as sponsors.\r\nThe shared goal of the United Nations and the IOC \r\nis to make the world a better and more peaceful place. \r\nFor the IOC, this means putting sport at the service of \r\nthe peaceful development of humankind. The Olympic \r\nTruce draft resolution before the Assembly today is an \r\nexpression of the shared commitment to humankind of \r\nboth our organizations.\r\nIn ancient Greece, the tradition of ekecheiria \r\ninvolved a sacred truce among Greek city-States. The \r\nOlympic Truce ensured a halt of hostilities, allowing \r\nfor the safe passage and participation of athletes and \r\nspectators to the Olympic Games. Then, as now, the \r\nOlympic Games are a symbol of hope and peace. In our \r\ntroubled times today, we see that these Olympic values \r\nof peace, solidarity and respect are eternal values.\r\nThe draft resolution entitled “Building a peaceful \r\nand better world through sport and the Olympic ideal” \r\nbuilds on that 3000-year-old tradition. Paragraph 1 of \r\nthe draft resolution L.5 urges Member States\r\n“to ensure the safe passage, access and participation \r\nof athletes, officials and all other accredited \r\npersons taking part in the Olympic Winter Games \r\nand Paralympic Winter Games”.\r\nThis specific call is of particular importance, especially \r\nwith regard to the time and place of the Olympic Winter \r\nGames. By adopting this draft resolution, the General \r\nAssembly recognizes once more the relevance of the \r\nOlympic Games to fostering peace and understanding \r\nin our fragile world.\r\nPierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern \r\nOlympic movement, once said: “The Olympic Games are \r\na pilgrimage to the past and an act of faith in the future.” \r\nIn the same spirit, the support of States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations for this draft resolution is an expression \r\nof faith by the international community in a peaceful \r\nfuture for our world. The power of the Olympic Games \r\nis their universality and global appeal. Based on our \r\nprinciple of political neutrality, the Olympic Games \r\nstand above and beyond all the political differences that \r\ndivide us. In our fragile world, which is drifting apart, \r\nthe Olympic Games have the power to unite humankind \r\nin all its diversity. In our fragile world, polarization and \r\nmistrust are growing. In our fragile world, the Olympic \r\nGames always build bridges. They never erect walls.\r\nSport plays a unique role in putting the values of \r\npeace, solidarity and respect into action. The important \r\nrole of sport in society was confirmed by the General \r\nAssembly when recognizing sport in the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development as an important enabler, \r\nin particular to foster peace and understanding.\r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 15/28\r\nThe last time that I addressed the General Assembly \r\nwas ahead of the adoption of resolution 70/4, the \r\nOlympic Truce resolution for the Olympic Games Rio \r\n2016 (see A/70/PV.39). On that occasion, I announced \r\nthe creation of the first-ever refugee Olympic team. \r\nTheir participation at the Olympic Games sent a \r\nmessage of hope to the millions of refugees around \r\nthe world. It was a demonstration of how sport is this \r\nimportant enabler. To make this a reality, we enjoyed the \r\nstrong cooperation of the United Nations, in particular \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \r\nwhose Office I would like to thank once more for its \r\ncontinuing support.\r\nKnowing that the theme of this seventy-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly is “Focusing on \r\npeople: striving for peace and a decent life for all \r\non a sustainable planet”, I would like to address the \r\nAssembly for a moment as an Olympic athlete myself. I \r\ndo so because, for Olympic athletes, this draft resolution \r\nwill carry a very special significance and a deeply \r\npersonal one. It is the dream of every athlete to compete \r\nat the Olympic Games. For us athletes, it is a once-in-a-\r\nlifetime experience. It is our moment to shine.\r\nWith the Olympic Truce resolution, the General \r\nAssembly is creating the conditions for all athletes \r\nto compete in peace. Only the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations can guarantee athletes’ safe passage to \r\nthe Olympic Games. They make it possible for all the \r\nOlympic athletes to realize their dream of a lifetime. \r\nOne may ask why this should matter to the international \r\ncommunity. The answer is simple: the Olympic athletes \r\nshow the whole world that it is possible to compete with \r\neach other while living peacefully together under one \r\nroof at the same time.\r\nIn the Olympic Village, where the athletes live \r\nduring the competitions, we see our values of tolerance \r\nand respect come to life. Athletes from all National \r\nOlympic Committees, from every corner of the world, \r\nlive together in harmony under one roof. The athletes \r\nlive side by side in what is literally a global village. \r\nThey share their meals, experiences and emotions. \r\nThey are competitors in sport, but they share their \r\nrespect for each other in victory and defeat. That is why \r\nthe athletes are our best ambassadors for our ideals and \r\nvalues. The athletes lead by example. Our fragile world \r\nneeds such symbols of friendship and tolerance more \r\nthan ever before.\r\nMy sincere thanks for their great work go to \r\nthe Government of the Republic of Korea and to the \r\nPyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 \r\nOlympic and Paralympic Winter Games under the \r\nable leadership of President Lee Hee-beom. They have \r\ncreated the best venues and conditions for the best \r\nwinter-sport athletes in our world. When Pyeongchang \r\nwelcomes the world, just 87 days from today, it will \r\nbe an important reminder that the Olympic Games are \r\nalways a time when the international community comes \r\ntogether to celebrate our shared humanity.\r\nThe IOC would like to reiterate our invitation to \r\neveryone to join us at the 2018 Olympic Winter Games. \r\nIn sport, we are all equal. That is why everyone is invited \r\nto celebrate our shared values, the best of the human \r\nspirit and our unity in diversity. The 2018 Olympic \r\nWinter Games in Pyeongchang will give us hope in our \r\ntroubled times for a better future. The Olympic Games \r\ndemonstrate that our values of a shared humanity are \r\nstronger than all the forces that want to divide us. With \r\nthe support of the delegations here today, the Olympic \r\nspirit will come alive right here among the nations of \r\nthe world gathered at the General Assembly. This is \r\nanother example of the fact that Olympic principles are \r\nUnited Nations principles. On behalf of all the athletes \r\nin the world, I thank the Assembly very much for \r\nsharing this Olympic spirit.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/72/L.5, entitled “Building a peaceful and \r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic ideal”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMs. De Miranda (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I should \r\nlike to announce that, since the submission of the \r\ndraft resolution A/72/L.5, and in addition to those \r\ndelegations listed in the document, the following \r\ncountries have also become sponsors: Afghanistan, \r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, \r\nAzerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei Darussalam, Burundi, \r\nCabo Verde, Cambodia, Chad, Colombia, Cuba, the \r\nCzech Republic, Dominica, Denmark, Djibouti, the \r\nDominican Republic, El Salvador, the Gambia, Georgia, \r\nGrenada, Guyana, Iraq, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Kiribati, \r\nLebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, \r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n16/28 17-37640\r\nMaldives, Mali, the Marshall Islands, Mauritius, the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia, Montenegro, Morocco, \r\nMozambique, Namibia, Nauru, Nepal, New Zealand, \r\nthe Niger, Nigeria, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, \r\nParaguay, the Philippines, Portugal, the Republic of \r\nMoldova, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, San Marino, Serbia, Seychelles, Sierra \r\nLeone, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri Lanka, \r\nSouth Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Sweden, Tajikistan, \r\nTimor-Leste, Uganda, the United Arab Emirates, the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, \r\nVanuatu, Venezuela, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to adopt draft resolution A/72/L.5?\r\nDraft resolution A/72/L.5 was adopted (resolution \r\n72/6).\r\nThe President: I thank our guests for joining us \r\nthis morning and once again express my best wishes \r\nto the Republic of Korea for the twenty-third Winter \r\nOlympic Games.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 11.\r\nAgenda items 120 and 121\r\nImplementation of the resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nThe President: The agenda item for our meeting \r\ntoday refers to the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. In simple terms, we are here to \r\nexplore how to strengthen the role of this body, improve \r\nthe work we do and best address the interests of the \r\nGovernments and, more importantly, the people we are \r\nall here to represent. This is therefore a discussion that \r\naffects all of us.\r\nI want to express my sincere thanks to Ambassadors \r\nDrobnjak and Nusseibeh, of Croatia and the United \r\nArab Emirates, respectively, for their dedicated work \r\nas co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly during the \r\nseventy-first session. I am confident that all Member \r\nStates will offer their full support to Ambassador \r\nDrobnjak, as well as to his newly appointed co-Chair, \r\nAmbassador Mejía Vélez of Colombia, in the session \r\nahead. I want to make four main points today.\r\nThe first is that this process does work. Over the \r\npast few years, we have made achievements. A major \r\nexample is, of course, the selection and appointment of \r\nthe Secretary-General. For decades, this was a secret \r\nprocess; however, Member States said no to business as \r\nusual. That is why, in 2016, things were done differently. \r\nFor the first time, the world had an opportunity to \r\nreview and even interact with the candidates for the top \r\nposition at the United Nations. Member States have also \r\nmandated me to continue this trend of transparency and \r\ninclusiveness in the selection of my successor.\r\nThe introduction of an oath of office and code of \r\nethics for the President of the General Assembly were \r\nfurther powerful achievements. Now, no President can \r\never claim that he or she is ignorant of the standards \r\nand responsibility attached to this Office. Another \r\ntangible result was seen through the adoption of \r\nresolutions that set clear time frames for elections. \r\nThese have helped Member States to better prepare for \r\ntheir roles, including as members of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and as non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMy second point is more personal. I am not here just \r\nto call for action from Member States; action is needed \r\nfrom me as well. I was the second president in history \r\nto take the oath of office, and I follow this oath closely \r\nas I work to uphold the high standards of transparency \r\nand ethics set by my two predecessors. This work \r\nhas taken three main forms. The first is through full \r\ndisclosure related to the financing, staffing and travel \r\nof my Office; all such information is available on my \r\nwebsite. I will soon become the first President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to publish a summary of my financial \r\ndisclosure statement online, which I hope will serve as \r\na concrete measure for stepping up the commitment \r\nof this Office to transparency. The second way relates \r\nto the activities of my Office. I publish my agenda on \r\nmy website every day. My spokesperson also gives \r\ndaily briefings to the media. These efforts are not just \r\ngeared towards transparency, they are also intended to \r\npromote awareness and interest in the activities of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe third way is through interaction with other parts \r\nof the United Nations system. I intend to make full use \r\nof the General Committee, as requested by resolution \r\n71/323. I met informally with the Committee before the \r\nstart of the regular session to allow for a frank exchange \r\nof views. Our third meeting of the session is scheduled \r\nto take place in December. Additionally, I hold monthly \r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 17/28\r\nmeetings with the Secretary-General and the presidents \r\nof the Security Council and Economic and Social \r\nCouncil to strengthen coherence throughout our work. \r\nI want to use the opportunity presented by this meeting \r\nto stress my commitment to the revitalization process.\r\nMy third point today is that we need to look \r\nahead. We will discuss many important issues during \r\nthe seventy-second session. Three issues that may be \r\nconsidered include, first, conduct related to election \r\ncampaigns; secondly, the strengthening of interaction \r\nbetween Permanent Missions and the Secretariat; and \r\nthirdly, options for establishing a longer-term and \r\nmore transparent rotation of the Chairs of the Main \r\nCommittees. The issue of reform will also be high on \r\nour agenda, which will provide us with an opportunity \r\nto enhance the General Assembly’s engagement with \r\nand role throughout the United Nations system.\r\nWhen looking ahead, I want to point to the gap \r\nbetween the level of mandated activities and events and \r\nthe capacity of the United Nations system to support \r\nthem. My Office is grappling with this challenge, and I \r\nurge the Assembly to address it. On a related note, I want \r\nto highlight the lack of institutional memory within \r\nthis Office. Investment in human capital is needed if \r\nMember States wish to maintain standards of work and \r\nensure smooth transitions between presidencies.\r\nAs I have said before, action is needed from me as \r\nwell. I have launched a series of morning dialogues, \r\nwhich will target all States Members of the United \r\nNations. These dialogues are intended to complement \r\nthe ongoing processes of the seventy-second \r\nsession, such as the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nFinally, I want to remind all of us of the \r\nresponsibility on our shoulders. The General Assembly \r\nis the most representative body of the United Nations. It \r\ngives all 193 Member States a voice and a vote. It deals \r\nwith all three pillars of the work of the United Nations: \r\npeace and security, development and human rights. It \r\nalso draws in all actors and entities from across the \r\nUnited Nations system. That is why the impact of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly extends far beyond this \r\nHall. In fact, what we do here affects the credibility and \r\noutcomes of the United Nations as a whole. Improving \r\nthe way we work is therefore not only in the interest of \r\nall of us here today — it is also in the interest of people \r\nin their homes and communities, thousands of miles \r\naway from here.\r\nI believe that this Hall should be a place for dialogue, \r\na place we should enter with ideas and proposals and \r\nexit from with new perspectives and achievements. \r\nThis is a place where the interests of all 193 Member \r\nStates and the billions of people they represent can \r\nbe advanced.\r\nThe General Assembly cannot be a place to advance \r\nour own interests. It cannot be a place we come to with \r\nnothing but red lines and static positions, even if that \r\nmight be a tempting option, because it could lead to a \r\nwin for just one person or one State or one group. But \r\noverall, we will all lose. I urge everyone to bear that \r\nin mind as we discuss the revitalization of the work of \r\nthis body.\r\nMr. Boukadoum (Algeria): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries (NAM), which is one of the largest cross-\r\nregional groups, consisting of 120 member States. \r\nLet me say that all ceremonial protocol, including \r\nappreciation to the co-Chairs and to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly, is respected.\r\nWe reiterate that the revitalization of the work \r\nof the General Assembly is a critical component of \r\na comprehensive reform of the United Nations. A \r\nreinvigorated General Assembly would significantly \r\ncontribute to strengthening the wider United Nations \r\nsystem, improving international governance and \r\nenhancing multilateralism. A thorough evaluation of \r\nthe status of the implementation of General Assembly \r\nresolutions and a clear identification of the underlying \r\ncauses behind any lack of implementation are vital.\r\nWe fully adhere to the letter and spirit of the \r\nconsensus resolutions 69/321, 70/305 and 71/323, which \r\nare now the cornerstones for the evolution of the reform \r\nof the United Nations. In this regard, the Movement \r\nrecalls the decision taken in paragraph 4 of resolutions \r\n68/307, 69/321, 70/305 and 71/323 to continue the \r\nprocess of the comprehensive review of the inventory \r\nof the resolutions on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly and the status of their implementation. \r\nHowever, we also take note of the fact that the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General contained in document A/70/681 \r\nhas not yet been implemented.\r\nDuring the current session we wish to emphasize \r\nthe following. First, with respect to the process of \r\nselecting and appointing the Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations, the appointment should continue \r\nto be transparent, democratic and inclusive of all \r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n18/28 17-37640\r\nMember States, so as to enable the General Assembly \r\nto participate effectively and efficiently in the selection \r\nand appointment process. The Non-Aligned Movement \r\nproudly recalls the role played by the General Assembly \r\nunder Article 97 of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand its consensual resolutions 69/321, 70/305 and \r\n71/323. We should not forget that the Secretary-General \r\nwill be appointed and selected by the General Assembly \r\nupon the recommendation of the Security Council.\r\nWe find the implementation of paragraph 42 of \r\nresolution 69/321, paragraph 36 of resolution 70/305 and \r\nparagraph 56 of resolution 71/323 on the organization \r\nof informal dialogues to be encouraging. While \r\nwelcoming the signing of the joint letter by which the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil formally launch the beginning of the process, \r\nit is the clear understanding of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement that whatever the stage of the presentation \r\nof the candidates, the new procedure, as outlined in the \r\njoint letter of the President of the General Assembly \r\nand President of the Security Council, will always be \r\nfollowed. Furthermore, NAM calls on the Presidents \r\nof the General Assembly and the Security Council \r\nto continue to hold timely informal meetings for \r\nan exchange of views with candidates presented by \r\nMember States.\r\nWe also believe, as suggested in the 2011 report \r\n(A/66/34) of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU), that \r\nprevailing practices in the election of executive heads \r\nin other United Nations system organizations could \r\nalso be suitable for the appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We therefore recommend considering existing \r\npractices. Moreover, NAM would like to emphasize the \r\nissue of promises made by candidates in exchange for \r\nthe support of the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil, which is described in the 2011 JIU report.\r\nIn that regard, we welcomed the significant number \r\nof women candidates, as stipulated in paragraph 44 \r\nof resolution 71/323. There was a discussion about \r\nthe desirability for the Security Council to consider \r\nproviding a plural number of candidates to the General \r\nAssembly for the appointment of the Secretary-General \r\nin future. We emphasize the need to re-examine the \r\nidea. We reiterate that the process of appointment of \r\nthe Secretary-General by the General Assembly should \r\nbe carried out in full compliance with the General \r\nAssembly’s mandate, which includes the timely \r\nsubmission of the relevant draft resolution, which \r\nshould be preceded by wide and extensive consultations \r\nwith all Member States, as well as ensuring the action \r\nof the General Assembly on the recommendation of the \r\nSecurity Council, including by secret ballot, in full and \r\nstrict conformity with rule 141 of the rules of procedure \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nWe take note of the request made by the Secretariat to \r\nall Member States encouraging nominating candidates \r\nto supplement the Secretary-General’s search, in order \r\nto ensure a wide pool of candidates for positions at the \r\nlevel of Under-Secretary-General, and welcoming the \r\nnomination of women candidates. Bearing in mind the \r\nimportance of the best practices and lessons learned \r\nfrom the last selection and appointment process, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement is of the view that the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of \r\nthe General Assembly should consider developing a \r\ncompendium of those best practices for future reference.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the strengthening of the \r\ninstitutional memory of the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly, NAM finds it encouraging that \r\nan oath of office and a code of ethics for the President \r\nof the General Assembly have been adopted for the \r\nfirst time in the Assembly’s history. The expansion \r\nof activities of the General Assembly has made the \r\nPresident’s presence and active participation essential \r\nall year long. NAM also reiterates the need to assign \r\nadditional posts to the Office of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on a permanent basis. Furthermore, \r\nwe also appreciate the Member States that have \r\nprovided concrete support to the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly by seconding staff members \r\nfrom their respective missions.\r\nNAM also attaches great importance to ensuring \r\nsuccessful annual transitions between the Presidents \r\nof the General Assembly, and requests that outgoing \r\nPresidents brief their successors on lessons learned and \r\nbest practices. NAM expresses its support for effectively \r\nand genuinely strengthening the institutional memory \r\nof the Office of the President of the General Assembly, \r\nas well as for allocating sufficient human and financial \r\nresources to the Office from the regular budget of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThirdly, with respect to the role and authority of \r\nthe General Assembly, NAM reaffirms that working \r\nmethods are only one step towards more substantive \r\nimprovements aimed at restoring and enhancing \r\nthe Assembly’s role and authority. We affirm the \r\nimportance of preserving the intergovernmental, \r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 19/28\r\ninclusive and democratic nature of the United Nations \r\nand of consulting with Member States within the \r\nOrganization, as well as of ensuring strict respect \r\non the part of Member States for the Charter-based \r\nprerogatives of the United Nations principal organs, \r\nespecially the General Assembly. We also support the \r\ninitiative aimed at ensuring proper implementation of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations with respect to the \r\nfunctional relationship between its main organs, in \r\nparticular the General Assembly and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. At the Ad Hoc Working Group’s most \r\nrecent meeting, there was a discussion of the need to \r\nestablish, within its framework, a standing mechanism \r\nfor dialogue between the Permanent Missions and the \r\nSecretariat, with a view to considering further required \r\nsteps. We look forward to continuing that discussion.\r\nFourthly, on the working methods of the General \r\nAssembly, we welcomed paragraph 51 of resolution \r\n71/323, which notes with appreciation the cost-neutral \r\nproposals on the possible changes to the format, \r\nproduction and editing of the Journal of the United \r\nNations. We also welcomed its paragraphs 47 and \r\n48, on communicating the names of candidates for \r\nelection to the Secretariat 48 hours prior to an election \r\nwhere possible, as well as printing names on the ballot \r\npapers, and the decision that, on the day of elections, \r\nthe campaign materials in the General Assembly Hall \r\nor the Committee meeting room should be limited to \r\na single page of information regarding the candidates. \r\nNAM would like to recall here that the General \r\nAssembly has encouraged its Main Committees to \r\ncontinue considering and making proposals on their \r\nworking methods during the current session. In that \r\nconnection, we reiterate the importance of ensuring \r\nthe intergovernmental and inclusive nature of these \r\ndiscussions on working methods, which must engage \r\nall delegations. We believe that more time should be \r\ndedicated to the negotiations on this draft resolution. \r\nResolution 71/323 was adopted by consensus. However, \r\nwe continue to insist that more f lexibility should \r\nbe the rule for all Member States in the next round \r\nof negotiations.\r\nNAM calls for measures to enhance public \r\nawareness of the role and activities of the General \r\nAssembly and encourages improved media reporting of \r\nits work. We welcome paragraph 15 of resolution 71/323, \r\nwhich calls on the President of the General Assembly to \r\norganize debates in close coordination with the General \r\nCommittee and Member States, including with regard \r\nto their frequency. We believe that meetings held at the \r\nsame time as the general debate of the General Assembly \r\nmust be kept to an absolute minimum of only the most \r\ncritical, in order to preserve and strengthen the sanctity \r\nof the general debate, a view reflected in paragraph \r\n34 of resolution 71/323. Similarly, where all the high-\r\nlevel thematic debates convened by the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly are concerned, we need to improve \r\nthe coordination of the revitalization process with the \r\nwork of the Committee on Conferences.\r\nMr. Djani (Indonesia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe should also take a closer look at the process \r\nof arrangements for holding debates in the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council and their follow-up, \r\nin view of the number of participating representatives. \r\nNo oral statement should exceed the agreed-on number \r\nof minutes, and full versions can be circulated in the \r\nroom or posted online. Organizers can make the record \r\nof the proceedings available. Furthermore, we propose \r\nholding briefings, as necessary, with the Chairs of \r\nthe Main Committees, as well as a meeting with the \r\nSecretary-General. NAM also calls for improved \r\nmonitoring of the implementation of past resolutions.\r\nIn conclusion, the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nreaffirms its commitment to contributing effectively \r\nand constructively to the work of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly. We hope for the same approach from \r\nother delegations and would like to humbly recall \r\nthat we speak in the name of 120 member States. In \r\naddition, NAM stands ready to cooperate with you, \r\nMr. President, the co-Chairs and the Secretary-General \r\nin strengthening the role of the General Assembly as the \r\nchief deliberative policymaking organ. We will continue \r\nto provide support aimed at achieving inclusiveness, \r\ntransparency and efficiency in the United Nations.\r\nMrs. Azucena (Philippines): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), which consists of 10 member \r\nStates — Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \r\nMyanmar, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam and my own \r\ncountry, the Philippines.\r\nASEAN would like to convey its deepest sympathies \r\nand condolences to the families of the victims of the \r\nearthquakes in Iran and Iraq and in Costa Rica.\r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n20/28 17-37640\r\nASEAN also aligns itself with the statement just \r\ndelivered by the representative of Algeria on behalf of \r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nASEAN would like to congratulate the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of the United Arab Emirates and \r\nCroatia on their excellent work in the past year as \r\nco-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly, \r\nas well as the Permanent Representative of Colombia, \r\nthe incoming co-Chair together with the Ambassador \r\nof Croatia, and commends the progress they have made, \r\nas reflected in resolution 71/323, adopted by consensus \r\non 8 September.\r\nASEAN would also like to reiterate its profound \r\nappreciation to Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session, for \r\nhis steadfast commitment to moving the agenda on \r\nrevitalization forward and especially for his advocacy for \r\naccountability, transparency and openness. We would \r\nalso like to once again congratulate the President of the \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session, Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák. We believe that under his leadership the process \r\nof revitalization will yield more positive results.\r\nASEAN believes that the revitalization \r\nprocess will make the Organization more effective, \r\ntransparent, inclusive and fit for purpose. In the words \r\nof Secretary-General António Guterres, we have a \r\nshared responsibility to make the United Nations more \r\neffective and responsive to those we serve. We would \r\ntherefore like to make the following key points on the \r\nfour thematic clusters under the revitalization process.\r\nWith regard to the role and authority of the General \r\nAssembly, ASEAN reiterates its call for all Member \r\nStates to work together to ensure that the General \r\nAssembly is able to fulfil its proper role as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWith respect to the Assembly’s working methods, \r\nASEAN joins Member States on the recommendation \r\nto enhance synergies and coherence, reduce overlap \r\nwhere it exists on the Assembly’s agenda, and introduce \r\nappropriate measures to raise public awareness of the \r\nAssembly’s role and activities.\r\nRegarding the selection and appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General and other executive heads, ASEAN is \r\nof the view that resolution 71/323 must be implemented \r\nfaithfully to ensure that the selection process is \r\ntransparent and inclusive and that the best possible \r\ncandidate is selected for the position of Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We also emphasize that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral must exercise independence in selecting senior \r\nofficials with adherence to the highest standards in \r\nsuch appointments, while ensuring equal and fair \r\ndistribution based on gender and geographic balance.\r\nWith regard to strengthening the institutional \r\nmemory of the Office of the President of the General \r\nAssembly, ASEAN stands ready to support the agenda \r\nand calls for the full implementation of the relevant \r\nprovisions of resolution 71/323.\r\nASEAN welcomed resolution 71/323’s reaffirmation \r\nof the importance and benefits of interaction between \r\nthe United Nations and international and regional \r\nforums and organizations that deal with matters of \r\nglobal concern to the international community. We \r\ntake note of the report to the President of the General \r\nAssembly on the strategic alignment of future sessions \r\nof the General Assembly with the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. ASEAN also recognizes that \r\ncomplementarities exist between the 2030 Agenda and \r\nASEAN’s Community Vision 2025. We continue to \r\nrecognize the importance of dialogue and cooperation \r\nbetween ASEAN and the United Nations in taking \r\nforward the work of enhancing such complementarities, \r\nas reflected in the ASEAN-United Nations Plan of \r\nAction for the period from 2016 to 2020.\r\nASEAN reaffirms its commitment to engaging \r\neffectively and constructively with all Member States \r\nin order to ensure success for the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup in its task of revitalizing the work of the General \r\nAssembly. With the political will of all Member States, \r\nnot only will we be able to achieve concrete results, \r\nwe will also be able to promote greater efficiency, \r\ntransparency and accountability in the United Nations. \r\nRevitalizing the work of the General Assembly under \r\nthe four thematic clusters will contribute to the strategic \r\nevolution of the United Nations as an important platform \r\nwhere the universal values of equality, tolerance and \r\nhuman dignity prevail.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMs. Adamson (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and its \r\nmember States. The candidate countries the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia \r\nand Albania; the country of the Stabilization and \r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 21/28\r\nAssociation Process and potential candidate Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina; as well as Ukraine, the Republic \r\nof Moldova and Georgia, align themselves with \r\nthis statement.\r\nI would like to thank the President for convening \r\ntoday’s plenary meeting. We look forward to working \r\nwith him on the negotiations on the draft resolution \r\non the subject during the coming weeks. I would like \r\nto thank Mr. Peter Thomson, the President of the \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session, for his oversight \r\nof and engagement in the revitalization process of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the past year. I would also like to \r\nextend my sincere gratitude to the previous co-Chairs \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization \r\nof the Work of the General Assembly, Mr. Vladimir \r\nDrobnjak and Mrs. Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Croatia and the United \r\nArab Emirates. We are sure their excellent work will \r\ncontinue under Mr. Drobnjak’s ongoing leadership. We \r\nwish him and the new co-Chair success for this year \r\nand would like to express our support for the upcoming \r\nwork in the hope of continuing the significant progress \r\nmade in the previous session.\r\nThe recent resolutions on revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly have been groundbreaking. New and \r\ninnovative ideas have been introduced, such as those \r\non the process for the selection and appointment of \r\nthe Secretary-General, the strengthening of the Office \r\nof the President of the General Assembly, including \r\nincreasing its accountability, and most recently the \r\ndecision to improve the Assembly’s working methods. \r\nResolutions on revitalizing the Assembly represent a \r\nsuccess for all of us, the United Nations and Member \r\nStates alike, and serve as proof of how much can be \r\nachieved through constructive, reform-oriented and \r\nconsensus-based work. It is a result of the willingness \r\nof Member States to engage in a thorough, substantive \r\ndebate on the numerous issues that are vital to the \r\nfurther improvement and enrichment of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nFor the EU and its member States, effective \r\nmultilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, \r\nremains key. We therefore continue to strongly \r\nsupport the Secretary-General in his reform efforts. \r\nStrengthening the Organization, and doing so based \r\non effective and sustainable funding, in line with real \r\ncapacities to pay and geared to increasing efficiency and \r\naccountability, remains a top priority. In that context, we \r\nremain committed to revitalization and to supporting \r\nefforts aimed at strengthening the role and authority \r\nof the General Assembly, in line with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and the relevant resolutions. That is \r\nespecially needed in the context of the global challenges \r\nthat the world is facing today. An unceasing effort to \r\nfind new and creative ways to work is essential if we \r\nare to achieve more effective delivery of mandates and \r\nthe sustainable use of resources. Revitalizing the work \r\nof the General Assembly is clearly foundational for the \r\noverall reform of the United Nations.\r\nFocusing on the negotiations ahead of us, we \r\nbelieve that the emphasis on the current session’s draft \r\nresolution should be on consolidating the work achieved \r\nso far. We remain committed to contributing to improve \r\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of the workings of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I would like to assure the Assembly \r\nthat the EU and its member States will continue to \r\nengage in a constructive manner in the proceedings of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group.\r\nMs. Zahir (Maldives): I would first like to thank \r\nAmbassadors Vladimir Drobnjak of Croatia and \r\nMaría Emma Mejía Vélez of Colombia for agreeing \r\nto serve as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\non the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly, and to thank Ms. Mejía Vélez’s predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Nusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates, \r\nfor her leadership and valuable contribution, together \r\nwith Mr. Drobnjak, during the previous session of this \r\nongoing process.\r\nI would also like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report under this agenda item. I would once again \r\nlike to impress upon the Secretariat the importance of \r\ncirculating such reports to the membership in a timely \r\nmanner so as to allow Member States to be able to \r\nreview and discuss them in depth. That could be one \r\nof the crucial adjustments that we can make to enhance \r\nour working methods.\r\nThe Maldives applauds the small but significant \r\nstrides that this process has been able to achieve so \r\nfar. During the recently concluded elections held in the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall, the campaign materials and \r\nother items were restricted to one piece per candidate. \r\nThat was a welcome change that we believe restored \r\nthe atmosphere in this great Hall to one reflecting the \r\nseriousness of the business and proper decorum.\r\nWe believe that the mandate of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup for the seventy-second session goes a bit too \r\nfar. We support considering the potential concept and \r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n22/28 17-37640\r\nscope of conduct in guiding Member States’ conduct of \r\nelection campaigns with a view to improving standards \r\nof transparency, accountability and equity. We believe \r\nthat not only would such considerations ensure the \r\nelection of the best person for the right job, they would \r\nalso ensure that we uphold the principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We believe that current \r\ntraditions leave small countries at a disadvantage. \r\nEvery country, regardless of its size or might and \r\ncertainly of how much it spends on a campaign, should \r\nhave a fair chance to serve on the Charter bodies and \r\nother entities of the United Nations. Every voice, \r\nespecially those in special situations, should be heard. \r\nHow can we claim to have their concerns answered \r\nwithout their representation? We therefore believe \r\nthat the same standards of transparency, fairness, and \r\naccountability that we expect in our domestic elections \r\nshould be observed here at the United Nations. We hope \r\nthat further work will be done on that issue during the \r\ncurrent session.\r\nThe whole selection and appointment process of \r\nthe Secretary-General, marked by unprecedented levels \r\nof transparency and inclusiveness, was yet another \r\nexample of the small but critical changes that are \r\nresulting from this revitalization process. We have also \r\nbegun to see more transparency and accountability on \r\nthe part of the President of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Office of the President. Such steps serve to enhance \r\nthe integrity of the General Assembly. We have also \r\nseen an improvement in the conduct of meetings, with \r\nbetter management of time and services.\r\nWe believe that we can improve things even more \r\nby looking at the work we do. If we think about the real \r\nimpact of the resolutions we adopt, the sad reality is that \r\nmany are not properly implemented. We believe that \r\nwe should consider the reasons why resolutions with \r\nactionable mandates are not executed, as well as the \r\nfact that it is quality, not just quantity, that determines \r\nsuccess. That goes hand in hand with the bigger and \r\nmore complex area of the revitalization process that \r\nwe have only just begun to deal with — aligning \r\nthe work of the Assembly with the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nThe General Assembly can become more effective \r\nif we enhance coherence among the Committees of \r\nthe General Assembly as well as between the work \r\nof the Assembly itself and that of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and the Security Council. While each \r\nhas its own mandates and specific agendas, we have \r\nrecognized the linkages between issues and agreed on \r\nthe need for a holistic approach. That is the idea behind \r\nthe interlinkages within the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals — that economic progress, social prosperity and \r\nthe protection of the environment are linked; peace \r\nand development are linked; and the realization of \r\nhuman rights is important for achieving meaningful \r\ndevelopment. We must also ensure that the funds and \r\nprogrammes under the Economic and Social Council, \r\nthe regional commissions and other subsidiary bodies \r\nwork towards common milestones and strategic goals.\r\nWe must continue the work already begun. We \r\nmust analyse the gaps, overlaps and duplications, if any, \r\nand ensure that we not only have all aspects covered, \r\nbut that this is done in a manner that will benefit the \r\nprocess the most. We cannot think of revitalization in \r\nsilos. In order for this to work, we must honestly review \r\nevery part of our Organization, because the fast-\r\nchanging global context demands that we keep abreast \r\nor be seen as no longer relevant.\r\nIn considering the improvement of our work here \r\nin the General Assembly, we must ensure that every \r\nMember State in this Hall has an equal opportunity to \r\ncontribute and be represented. The principle of equity \r\nmust be the cornerstone of our work. The Maldives \r\nbelieves in the promise of the United Nations and in \r\nthe beauty of multilateralism. We are making strides, \r\nbut we can and should do more. We should do all we \r\ncan to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the \r\nOrganization, so that what we do here makes a real \r\nimpact at home, in our countries. We can and should \r\nexamine the various ways and means by which we, the \r\ninternational community, can make a difference and \r\nplay a part in crafting shared solutions for our shared \r\ncommon destiny.\r\nMs. Velichko (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): All \r\nprotocol observed. That way of addressing such aspects \r\nof protocol is one of the latest innovations in the list of \r\nagreements that resulted from the most recent session \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of \r\nthe Work of the General Assembly, and Belarus would \r\nlike to see it entrenched.\r\nBelarus aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nearlier by the representative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nBelarus welcomes the appointment of Ms. María \r\nEmma Mejía Vélez, Permanent Representative of \r\nColombia to the United Nations, as co-Chair of the \r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 23/28\r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly. We firmly believe \r\nthat Ms. Mejía Vélez, together with Mr. Vladimir \r\nDrobnjak, Permanent Representative of Croatia, will \r\ngive new impetus to the Group’s work, and we wish \r\nthem every success.\r\nAt the end of the Assembly’s previous session, \r\nwe agreed to improve the mechanism for dialogue \r\nbetween the Permanent Missions of Member States \r\nand the Secretariat, and we look forward to seeing that \r\nidea implemented in practice. We believe that regular \r\nthematic events based on that process will help to \r\nreduce the technical burden on Member States in their \r\ninteractions with the Secretariat and give them timely \r\ninformation on the Secretariat’s planning of initiatives \r\ndesigned to streamline its work. That will help build \r\na system of predictable and trustworthy interactions \r\nthat is convenient for Member States as well as the \r\nSecretariat. We would like to note that some positive \r\nmoves have already been made in that process, with \r\nthe Secretariat beginning to consult with missions \r\nwhen it is taking decisions that will affect them. We \r\nalso commend the efficient response of the Department \r\nfor General Assembly and Conference Management to \r\nStates’ requests and Under-Secretary-General Pollard’s \r\npersonal involvement in those efforts. The initiative of \r\nthe Department of Management in piloting a one-stop-\r\nshopping option deserves special mention, and the \r\nopportunity for States to comment on the mechanism \r\nas it is being developed increases our optimism about \r\nits potential success.\r\nWe are also eagerly awaiting the roll-out in 2018 \r\nof a new version of the Journal of the United Nations, \r\nwith reorganized content and a user-friendly digital \r\ninterface. Member States have been asking to see this \r\nunique record of all the work that takes place within \r\nthe United Nations improved, made responsive to the \r\nrequirements of a modern digital society and published \r\nin all six official languages of the United Nations for \r\na long time. We hope that the Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management will follow \r\nthe example of the Department of Management and \r\ngive missions the opportunity to take part in the \r\nwork of developing this new product. We believe that \r\nonly by combining the efforts of Member States and \r\nthe Secretariat will we be able to create a truly user-\r\nfriendly yet informative Journal of the United Nations.\r\nToday, when we have finished considering this \r\nagenda item, the impending election of five members \r\nof the International Court of Justice should be \r\nanother opportunity to demonstrate our successful \r\nimplementation of ways to improve United Nations \r\nelection campaigns, based on last year’s decision \r\nto introduce a new format for ballots and limit the \r\ndistribution in the General Assembly Hall of campaign \r\nmaterials about candidates, including souvenirs. These \r\nchanges will unquestionably help Member States to \r\nstay within the bounds of protocol and avoid confusion \r\nin filling out ballots, which should have a positive \r\neffect on the outcome of elections. The next step in that \r\nprocess, as provided for in resolution 71/323, is defining \r\nthe concept and scope of a code of conduct regulating \r\nMember States’ conduct of election campaigns, with a \r\nview to improving their transparency, accountability \r\nand fairness.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to note that the \r\neffectiveness of the General Assembly’s decision-making \r\ndepends directly on its ability to respond promptly \r\nto today’s challenges and threats. For that, we need \r\na competent, relevant agenda rather than the one we \r\nactually possess, which was adopted more than 70 years \r\nago and has not been seriously revised since, while the \r\nnumber of items on it has ballooned. The current agenda \r\nincludes items that have long ago lost their relevance \r\nand are simply bumped automatically from session \r\nto session with no discussion. In that regard, Belarus \r\nwould like to propose that at its next meeting, the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group consider streamlining the General \r\nAssembly’s agenda by reducing the number of items on \r\nit. That will save resources and time and improve the \r\neffectiveness of the Assembly’s decision-making and \r\nour confidence in it.\r\nMs. Krisnamurthi (Indonesia): Indonesia would \r\nfirst like to convey its deepest sympathies and \r\ncondolences to the families of the victims of the \r\npowerful earthquakes that struck the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran, Iraq and Costa Rica this weekend, as well as to \r\nthe Governments and peoples of those countries, and \r\nwishes the injured a speedy recovery.\r\nWhile observing all protocol and congratulating the \r\nincoming co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe Revitalization of the Work of the General Assembly, \r\nas well as assuring them of our full cooperation and \r\nsupport, Indonesia reiterates that it will continue to \r\ncontribute actively to revitalizing the Assembly.\r\nIndonesia associates itself with the statements \r\nmade earlier by the representatives of Algeria, on behalf \r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n24/28 17-37640\r\nof the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, and the \r\nPhilippines, on behalf of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations.\r\nOur shared global challenges require a comprehensive \r\nand collaborative response. There is no better platform \r\nfor that than the General Assembly, which has the \r\nnecessary scope and is unique in representing all \r\nMember States and in its ability to harness their \r\nsupport. Given the deep connection between the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the concept \r\nof sustaining peace, the Assembly has a critical role \r\nin advancing those two agendas in a coherent and \r\neffective manner. That is why we believe that the \r\nwork of the Ad Hoc Working Group should also be \r\nlinked to other reform efforts — such as reform of the \r\nSecurity Council and the alignment exercise aimed at \r\nenhancing synergy between the General Assembly and \r\nthe Economic and Social Council — in order to further \r\nthe 2030 Agenda, the restructuring of the peace and \r\nsecurity architecture and other United Nations reforms \r\nin the area of management.\r\nGlobal peace and stability will be best addressed \r\nwhen the three pillars of peace and security, development \r\nand human rights are acting in unison and are firmly \r\nsupported by everyone. Indonesia is pleased that the \r\ntrends in the Assembly’s functions have generally been \r\nupward and positive, particularly since the adoption \r\nof resolution 69/321. It is vital to ensure that this \r\nmomentum is sustained. Both inside and outside the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group, Member States should work \r\ntogether to ensure that the provisions of resolution \r\n69/321, and other resolutions on the issue of revitalizing \r\nthe Assembly, are implemented. Indonesia will present \r\nits views on the four clusters in detail when the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group convenes specific thematic debates. \r\nFor now, we will mention a few additional points.\r\nFirst, while we very much welcomed the \r\nimprovements to the selection and appointment \r\nprocess for the ninth Secretary-General, we must \r\ninvolve Member States more meaningfully in future. \r\nIn that context, it is important to ensure that the best \r\npractices and lessons learned from that experience are \r\ndocumented while they are fresh in our memories. That \r\nwill make a good reference point for the doubtless many \r\nnew diplomats who will have joined the United Nations \r\nby the time the next selection process takes place.\r\nSecondly, Indonesia fully supports the expansion \r\nof constructive dialogue among countries to facilitate \r\ninternational peace and welfare. However, as was \r\nalluded to in resolution 71/323, we should rationalize \r\nthe number of high-level events. The focus should be \r\nmore on genuinely meeting our commitments so as to \r\nachieve concrete results on the ground. We also agree \r\nthat the Secretary-General should be requested to inform \r\nthe membership about any constraints that prevent the \r\nSecretariat from implementing any provisions of the \r\nresolutions on revitalization.\r\nThirdly, it is vital to improve the working methods \r\nof the Main Committees, the Assembly and its \r\nsubsidiary bodies by instituting good practices such as \r\nstreamlining resolutions and meetings, communicating \r\nthe names of candidates for election in advance, \r\ninstituting a code of conduct for election campaigns \r\nand ensuring timely handovers between outgoing and \r\nincoming officials.\r\nFourthly, as the role of the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly in dealing with international \r\nissues is growing, it should be receiving corresponding \r\nsupport, including through the ongoing practice of \r\nseconding personnel from Permanent Missions. We \r\nalso see merit in beginning the President’s term one \r\nweek earlier so that the President can better prepare for \r\nthe high-level debates.\r\nFinally, in the selection of United Nations \r\nexecutive heads and the appointment of other senior \r\npositions at Headquarters and in the field, we stress \r\nthe importance of fielding well-qualified, merit-based \r\ncandidates, ensuring a gender balance and broad \r\ngeographic distribution, particularly from countries \r\nwhose nationals are underrepresented, including small \r\nislands and developing and least developed countries. \r\nCountries that have a proven track record in contributing \r\nto the United Nations, including police- and troop-\r\ncontributing countries, should also be represented \r\nin the Secretariat. No country or group of countries \r\nshould have a monopoly or disproportionate number of \r\nnationals among the United Nations senior staff. Let us \r\ntogether enable the General Assembly to perform its role \r\nfully. For its part, Indonesia will work tirelessly in the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group and other forums to contribute \r\nto and support steps that meaningfully strengthen the \r\nAssembly and its mechanisms.\r\nMr. Teo (Singapore): I would first like to convey our \r\ndeepest sympathies to the Governments and peoples of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq for \r\nthe earthquake that struck this weekend, sadly claiming \r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 25/28\r\nthe lives of many and causing widespread destruction. \r\nWe would like to express our heartfelt condolences to \r\nthe survivors and their families, and wish the injured a \r\nspeedy recovery.\r\nI would like to thank the President for convening \r\nthis debate early in his presidency and giving priority to \r\nthe issue of the revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly. I join previous speakers in congratulating \r\nthe Ambassadors of Croatia and Colombia on their \r\nappointments as the new co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We \r\nare confident that they will continue to lead the work of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group in an inclusive, transparent \r\nand efficient manner, and that we will make further \r\nprogress under their leadership.\r\nThe revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly is an important issue for many States, \r\nincluding my own. As a small State, Singapore has \r\nbeen a strong supporter of a more efficient, effective \r\nand accountable United Nations and General Assembly. \r\nOur work here must reinforce the Assembly’s role and \r\nauthority, and we have consistently championed its \r\nrevitalization. Over the years, the work of the General \r\nAssembly has undoubtedly increased, not simply in \r\nvolume, but also in scope and depth. Its revitalization \r\nis therefore crucial to ensuring that it keeps abreast of \r\nthe challenges of the day and is able to discharge its \r\nresponsibilities as the main deliberative, policymaking \r\nand representative organ of the United Nations.\r\nIn the midst of the slow and difficult negotiations \r\nelsewhere in the United Nations, the work of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group has stood out as a lodestar of \r\nprogress. Over the past three years, we have adopted by \r\nconsensus three milestone resolutions that collectively \r\nserve to strengthen the authority and credibility of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly. We have made further progress \r\nthis year under the able leadership of the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Croatia and the United Arab Emirates, \r\nand I take this opportunity to congratulate them. The \r\ndecisions taken this year have led to quick and practical \r\nimprovements on the ground. For example, we now \r\nhave clearly printed ballot papers with new guidelines \r\non the distribution of campaign materials on election \r\nday, improving the election process in the General \r\nAssembly. Thanks to those improved procedures, none \r\nof the votes cast in the recent Human Rights Council \r\nelections were invalid. For my delegation, that was a \r\nvisible demonstration of how the work of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group can make a positive impact on our work \r\nhere in the General Assembly. We also welcome the \r\nother improvements that have resulted from decisions \r\nadopted in resolution 71/323, including many of our \r\nproposals, such as the instituting of handover meetings \r\nbetween the outgoing and incoming teams of the \r\nChairs of the Main Committees. Such decisions will \r\nhelp to improve the efficiency, complementarity and \r\ntransparency of the work of the General Assembly for \r\nthe benefit of all, particularly small States.\r\nWhile the progress achieved over the past few years \r\nis commendable, we must not rest on our laurels. It is \r\nimportant for us to build on that positive momentum, \r\nand continue our efforts to improve the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and its processes on a basis of \r\nconsensus. First, we must build on the improvements \r\nthat we have made in the working methods of the \r\nAssembly, notably the election process. In that regard, \r\nwe look forward to formulating a code of conduct to \r\nguide the conduct of Member States during election \r\ncampaigns. Our overriding goal is to ensure that current \r\nelection campaign practices at the United Nations do not \r\ninadvertently lead to spiraling costs as each competing \r\ndelegation tries to outdo other campaigns, which \r\nputs smaller developing countries at a disadvantage. \r\nCampaigns should ideally focus on the quality of the \r\ncandidates and their ability to contribute to the work of \r\nthe body in which they are seeking membership, not on \r\ngifts or lavish receptions.\r\nSecondly, improvements in the selection and \r\nappointment process of United Nations officials must \r\nnot stop with the appointment of the Secretary-General \r\nbut should extend to all other senior appointments \r\nwithin the Organization. We call on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to make appointments based on merit, while \r\ntaking into account gender and geographical balance \r\nand also ensuring the highest standards of efficiency, \r\ncompetence and integrity. There should no monopoly on \r\nsenior posts in the United Nations system by nationals \r\nof any State or group of countries.\r\nThirdly, we must continue our efforts to ensure \r\nthat the work of the General Assembly is fit for \r\npurpose. Our priority is to ensure that the agendas of \r\nthe General Assembly and its Main Committees, and \r\nof the Economic and Social Council, work coherently \r\nto support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, which is important for many \r\ndeveloping countries. We therefore look forward to \r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n26/28 17-37640\r\nworking with the President, as a member both of the \r\nGeneral Committee and an interested delegation, in \r\ndeveloping practical proposals aimed at addressing \r\ngaps and duplication in the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly as they relate to the 2030 Agenda.\r\nWe have made some suggestions aimed at \r\nincreasing the progress already being made in the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group. My delegation will work with \r\nthe President, as well as the new co-Chairs and other \r\ndelegations, in our joint endeavour to further enhance \r\nthe transparency, accountability, efficiency and \r\nlegitimacy of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Kawamura (Japan): At the outset, I want to \r\nsay that our delegation is deeply grieved by the news \r\nof the earthquake that struck the region bordering the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Iraq. We \r\nwould like to offer our deepest condolences to the \r\nbereaved and to express our heartfelt sympathies to all \r\nof the people who have been affected.\r\nI would like to begin by thanking the President \r\nof the General Assembly for convening today’s \r\nmeeting. I would also like to express my appreciation \r\nfor the President’s statement at the opening of the \r\nseventy-second session of the General Assembly (see \r\nA/72/PV.3), in which he clearly defined the importance \r\nof the revitalization process and showed his intention to \r\nfurther promote that process in the context of reform of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nConcerning the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, Japan welcomed the adoption of \r\nresolution 71/323. Our delegation would like to express \r\nits sincere gratitude to Ambassadors Drobnjak of \r\nCroatia and Nusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates \r\nfor their hard work and skilful chairship of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group. We welcome the reappointment \r\nof Ambassador Drobnjak and the appointment of \r\nAmbassador Mejía Vélez as co-Chairs of the Working \r\nGroup during the current session, and are looking \r\nforward to collaborating closely with them.\r\nWith regard to the implementation of United \r\nNations resolutions, our delegation would like to \r\nemphasize that the implementation of General Assembly \r\nresolutions, including those related to revitalization, \r\nis critical to enhancing the Assembly’s efficiency and \r\neffectiveness, and we also underline that it is Member \r\nStates’ responsibility to implement them. We have been \r\npleased to see several examples of the implementation \r\nof resolution 71/323 already. Rule 92 of the Assembly’s \r\nrules of procedure was amended in accordance with \r\nparagraph 46 of the resolution. On 16 October, the \r\nfirst election — of candidates for the Human Rights \r\nCouncil — was conducted with the new method of \r\nfilling out ballot papers. On election day in the Hall, \r\na single page of information about the candidates \r\nwas distributed to the desk of every delegation, in \r\naccordance with the resolution. Each of those instances \r\nrepresents an important step in the implementation of \r\nresolution 71/323.\r\nOur delegation believes that in promoting \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly and \r\nstrengthening its constituent roles, the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly plays a critical part. \r\nWe should continue to encourage the Office to maintain \r\nits transparency and effectiveness. Given the fact that \r\nthe activities of the President of the General Assembly \r\nhave increased substantially in recent years, adequate \r\nresources should be allocated to the Office to provide the \r\nsupport that it needs to carry them out successfully. In \r\nthat regard, Japan will provide a voluntary contribution \r\nto the United Nations Trust Fund in support of the \r\nOffice. The President of the Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, clearly expressed \r\nhis intention to include peace, prevention and the \r\navoidance of conflict, the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and climate change as his priorities. Japan shares \r\nthose priorities, and is willing to assist the President \r\nin exercising his leadership to address those difficult \r\nissues throughout the world.\r\nIn the course of the seventy-second session, it will \r\nbe important to continue the discussions on revitalizing \r\nthe Assembly. In particular, working methods will be \r\nanother essential part of those discussions. Japan has \r\nbeen very active in improving working methods within \r\nthe United Nations. For example, resolution 68/307 \r\nmoved the election dates for the Security Council and \r\nthe Economic and Social Council from October to \r\nJune. In order to take full advantage of that change, \r\nwhich is intended to give new members more time \r\nto prepare for their membership, Japan, as Chair of \r\nthe Security Council’s Informal Working Group on \r\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions, \r\nproposed that the Informal Working Group revisit the \r\ntransitional arrangements for newly elected members \r\nof the Council. In July 2016, following intensive \r\nconsultations, the Security Council adopted a new \r\npresidential note, contained in document S/2016/619. \r\nWith that new agreement, the newly elected members \r\n13/11/2017 A/72/PV.48\r\n17-37640 27/28\r\nare now invited to observe Council meetings starting \r\non 1 October. The note also includes improvements to \r\ntransparency and inclusivity in the selection process for \r\nthe Chairs of subsidiary organs, as well as measures to \r\nfacilitate early preparation by the Chairs.\r\nFollowing up on the open debate on the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council (see S/PV.7740) that \r\nwas held during our presidency of the Security Council \r\nin July 2016, Japan has initiated discussions in the \r\nInformal Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions to identify areas for further \r\nimprovements to the Council’s working methods, \r\nincluding increasing the Council’s interaction with the \r\nwider membership of the United Nations. On 30 August, \r\nthe Security Council agreed on a comprehensive new \r\npresidential note on its working methods (S/2017/507), \r\nwhich consolidates and streamlines all the existing \r\npresidential notes and lays out some new measures. \r\nJapan is eager to continue contributing to improving \r\nthe working methods of the United Nations, including \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe issue of the revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly is also an urgent challenge. \r\nThe current consideration of the possibility of the \r\nbiennialization or triennialization of agenda items \r\nshould continue, as has been done in the past few years, \r\nand we again look forward to working with Member \r\nStates on that issue during the current session.\r\nJust as we moved the elections to the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council to \r\nearlier dates through our adoption of resolution 68/307, \r\nwe might also consider holding the elections for the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly earlier, so that \r\nthe President-elect is afforded sufficient time to set \r\nup his or her team and prepare for the handover. Our \r\ndelegation proposed that point at a meeting of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group last year. We believe that this \r\nidea is in line with suggestions that have been made by \r\nseveral Chairs of the Main Committees, stressing the \r\nimportance of holding elections earlier in the interest \r\nof ensuring smooth transitions.\r\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming that \r\nJapan stands ready to support the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and contribute constructively to \r\nthe discussions on the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, with the aim of further enhancing the \r\neffectiveness and transparency of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Prasad (India): India would first like to \r\nexpress its sympathies to the families of the victims of \r\nthe earthquakes that took place over the weekend. We \r\nsincerely regret the loss of life.\r\nAt the outset, I align myself with the statement \r\nmade earlier by the representative of Algeria on behalf \r\nof the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nI would like to thank the President for convening \r\ntoday’s important meeting. I congratulate the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Croatia and Colombia on \r\ntheir appointment as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly and wish them success in their endeavours. \r\nThe co-Chairs for the seventy-first session also deserve \r\nour thanks for their excellent work.\r\nAny institution’s effectiveness, relevance and \r\nlongevity depend on its dynamic character and its \r\nability to adapt to changing times so that it not only \r\nupholds timeless values but also addresses the emerging \r\nproblems and challenges of the present day. The General \r\nAssembly is the most representative global body that \r\nthe collective enterprise and wisdom of humankind \r\nhas established to date. Its primacy f lows from the \r\nuniversality of its membership and the principle of \r\nthe sovereign equality of all of its members. It cannot \r\nbe compared to any other organization or institution \r\nwithin or outside the United Nations system, owing to \r\nits sheer representativeness and the moral weight of its \r\ndecisions and opinions. However, there is a widespread \r\nfeeling that the Assembly has been prevented from \r\nliving up to its unique role, as set out in Article 10 of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. In addition, over the \r\npast years, it has lost touch with its core responsibilities \r\nand is increasingly involved solely with processes.\r\nThe role and authority of the General Assembly \r\nhave been gradually undermined by the expansive role \r\nand activism of the Security Council. We must admit \r\nthat part of the blame lies with the General Assembly \r\nitself, which has allowed itself to be undermined and \r\nencroached on, despite representing the collective voice \r\nof humankind. That is counterproductive for the overall \r\neffectiveness and relevance of the United Nations.\r\nWe firmly believe that the position of the General \r\nAssembly as the chief deliberative policymaking and \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations, as mandated \r\nby the Charter, must be restored and respected in \r\nletter and in spirit. The Assembly must lead in setting \r\nthe global agenda and restoring the centrality of the \r\nA/72/PV.48 13/11/2017\r\n28/28 17-37640\r\nUnited Nations in formulating multilateral approaches \r\nto addressing emerging challenges and resolving \r\ntransnational issues. The leading role played by the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the Sustainable Development \r\nSummit in 2015, followed by the adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the success \r\nof this year’s Ocean Conference, are shining recent \r\nexamples of how the Assembly can set the global \r\nagenda and lead the way in addressing issues and \r\nconcerns of a global nature. It is therefore incumbent \r\non us, the Member States, to ensure that it maintains its \r\nleadership role on issues of transnational importance.\r\nThe process of revitalizing the General Assembly \r\nis an urgent task. In the past few years it has brought \r\nabout significant improvements aimed at meeting the \r\nincreasingly complex demands of our rapidly changing \r\nworld. Some of the positive outcomes that have been \r\nwidely acknowledged were evident during the 2016 \r\nselection of the Secretary-General and in the recent \r\nefforts to strengthen the Office of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation engaged actively in \r\nthe debate on improving the process and conduct of \r\nelections that led to the adoption of resolution 71/323. \r\nAmong other things, we have also furthered the cause \r\nof multilingualism at the United Nations and helped to \r\nfacilitate better cooperation between Member States \r\nand the Secretariat. Although the progress we are \r\nmaking is encouraging, we have a long way to go. My \r\ndelegation will continue to make additional concrete \r\nproposals on further revitalizing the General Assembly \r\nand to work actively for that broader purpose with \r\nother delegations.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly must \r\nalso be seen in the wider context of the overall reform \r\nof the United Nations. Since its inception in 1945, the \r\nUnited Nations has come a long way. However, its \r\ncontinued relevance and effectiveness in addressing \r\nemerging global challenges will depend largely on its \r\nability to stay abreast of changing times and realities. \r\nThe winds of change are blowing. The issue of United \r\nNations reform, including the revitalization of the \r\nAssembly and reform of the Security Council, is \r\nassuming increasing significance. We must heed the \r\ncall for United Nations reform made by many world \r\nleaders during the general debate at the beginning \r\nof the Assembly’s seventy-second session. It is our \r\nfirm belief that urgent and comprehensive reform \r\nis needed if we are to ensure that the Organization \r\nreflects current geopolitical realities and to enhance \r\nits capability to meet the increasingly complex and \r\npressing transnational challenges of our times.\r\nThe time for change has come. Let us make genuine \r\nefforts to strengthen the role of the General Assembly \r\nin setting the global agenda, policymaking and finding \r\nsolutions to global challenges and problems, which \r\nwill help to strengthen the legitimacy of the United \r\nNations and of multilateralism as a whole. The General \r\nAssembly can count on my delegation’s constructive \r\nsupport and participation in those efforts.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
