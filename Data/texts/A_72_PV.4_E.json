(Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Hilale \r\n(Morocco), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 12.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President \r\nof the Republic of Liberia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Liberia.\r\nMrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations Her Excellency Mrs. Ellen \r\nJohnson-Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia, \r\nand to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Johnson-Sirleaf: The seventy-second \r\nregular session of the General Assembly is being \r\nconvened at a time of historic transition in Liberia and \r\nduring a period of acute challenges to the global order. \r\nToday we face the threat of climate change, the violence \r\nof terrorism, the risks and indignaty of migration and a \r\nnuclear escalation on the Korean peninsula. Moreover, \r\nthere is a race against time to accommodate a restless, \r\nyouthful population in search of opportunity and a \r\nbrighter future.\r\nI would like to congratulate the Secretary-General \r\non his election. His progressive and creative leadership \r\nassures us of his commitment and his action to reform \r\nthe United Nations for increased efficiency, better \r\ncoordination and gender parity by 2021 at the senior \r\nleadership level. My delegation is also pleased with the \r\ninitial steps taken towards the implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals.\r\nI also wish to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session. His vast experience and strong \r\ndiplomatic skills assure us that he will steer the affairs \r\nof this session in an effective manner. The Liberian \r\ndelegation offers him its full cooperation and support.\r\nI would also like to recognize Mr. Peter Thompson \r\nof Fiji for his stewardship over the past year, which \r\nsaw the launch of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the successful conduct of the first \r\nOcean Conference.\r\nOur theme this year is “Focusing on people: Striving \r\nfor peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable \r\nplanet”, which aptly captures a universal aspiration. \r\nI hope that, at the conclusion of our deliberations, we \r\nwill forge a consensus and renew our commitment as \r\nleaders to transform the lives of our peoples and meet \r\nour responsibilities to our planet. The work of the \r\nUnited Nations has never been more important to the \r\nsearch for peace and sustenance for global stability than \r\nit is today.\r\nBy its Charter and its purposes, the United Nations \r\ncontinues to represent the genius of our collective \r\nability to live together in peace and harmony. It still \r\noffers great hope to a troubled world.

When I speak to women in Africa \r\nand across the world, I am humbled by the inspiration \r\ndrawn from my experience. The next generation must \r\nbelong to women.\r\nToday I address the Assembly for the last time \r\nas I bring my two terms of elected office to a close. \r\nLiberia is just 22 days away from historic legislative \r\nand presidential elections. It will mark the first time \r\nin 73 years that political power will be handed over \r\npeacefully and democratically from one elected leader \r\nto another. That will pave the way for the next generation \r\nof Liberians to lead the country into the future.\r\nThe election will signal the irreversible course that \r\nLiberia has embarked upon to consolidate its young, \r\npost-conflict democracy. Democracy is on the march in \r\nLiberia and, I believe, on an irreversible path forward \r\non the African continent. I thank all our partners who \r\nhave made meaningful contributions — financial and \r\nin kind — to ensure peaceful elections, and those \r\norganizations that will deploy observer missions to \r\nattest to the integrity of the election process.\r\nI assumed office after 25 years of development \r\nreversal, which was further compounded by a 15-year \r\ncivil war. We have made great progress and laid the \r\nfoundation for the next democratic Government. We \r\nhave reshaped the armed forces of Liberia and the \r\nLiberia national police and have professionalized \r\nour customs and immigration services and the small \r\nLiberian coast guard. We are proud to report that, since \r\nthe formal turnover of security responsibilities to our \r\nGovernment, Liberia has remained stable, peaceful \r\nand secure.\r\nWe transformed the economy from a growth rate \r\nof less than zero to more than 8.7 per cent in 2013, \r\nuntil the health crisis and plummeting commodity \r\nprices brought a downturn to our economic recovery. \r\nLiberia has adjusted. We are resilient, and we embrace \r\ndiversification. Our focus today is on strengthening \r\nthe agriculture sector for value-addition and \r\ninfrastructure development, with emphasis on roads \r\nand energy industrialization.\r\nPreviously dysfunctional public institutions now \r\nhave the capacity to respond to the needs of our citizens \r\nthrough decentralized county service centres, with \r\nownership by strong local Governments. And from \r\nthe tragedy of the health crisis, we are strengthening \r\nour health-care systems, prioritizing prevention and \r\ndelivering capacity at the community level. The \r\nimpact is being felt. Life expectancy progressed from \r\na low 47 years to a hopeful 62 years, with a reduction \r\nin maternal deaths from 1,400 to 1,100 — an annual \r\nrate of reduction of 3.4 per cent. The poverty rate has \r\ndecreased from 63.8 per cent in 2007 to 50.9 per cent \r\nin 2016.\r\nInfrastructure has been repaired and restored, and \r\nwe continue to rehabilitate damaged roads and construct \r\nnew ones. Cities and towns are bustling with new life, \r\nthanks to the increasing provision of electricity, potable \r\nwater and technology. It is now possible to receive voice \r\nand data on phones and mobile devices from virtually \r\neverywhere in the country, at competitively low prices.\r\nLiberia has enjoyed the benefit of multilateralism \r\nthrough the full support provided by the United Nations, \r\nthe African Union and the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States (ECOWAS). From being a pariah \r\nState, Liberia has gradually regained the confidence of \r\nnations and has even risen to assume leadership roles \r\nin regional bodies — specifically of ECOWAS and the \r\nMano River Union.\r\nI was personally privileged to play a role in the \r\nformulation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment as co-Chair of former Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon’s High-level Panel on the Post-2015 \r\nDevelopment Agenda and to help frame the African \r\ncommon position as Chair of the African Union high-\r\nlevel committee.\r\nThere is so much more to share about Liberia’s \r\npost-conflict transformation — how we have \r\nempowered ordinary citizens and a shared sense of \r\ncitizenship, giving women, including market and rural \r\nwomen, a voice and the right to be heard. We have \r\ncontinued to transform the health-care and education \r\nsystems, engender the entrepreneurial spirit in our \r\nyouth, our vibrant media and our civil society. We are \r\nestablishing cross-border development corridors to \r\nenhance regional trade, and we are strengthening the \r\nrule of law to tackle systemic undermining of integrity. \r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 3/28\r\nLiberia is experiencing the birth of a post-conflict \r\nartistic community in song, hip-hop, painting, poetry, \r\nstorytelling and fashion.\r\nLiberia has come a long way. We could \r\nnot have accomplished all of that without the \r\nOrganization — its political leadership, the generosity \r\nof its economic development support, humanitarian \r\ncontributions and, most important, the stabilization and \r\nsecurity provided to our country through the United \r\nNations Mission in Liberia.\r\nI applaud you, Mr. President, and your predecessors, \r\nthe Member States and United Nations civil servants \r\naround the world who have sacrificed in order for us \r\nto see the very first generation of school-age children \r\ngrowing up in an environment of peace, free of the \r\nviolence of civil conflict. Liberia’s transformation \r\nwas powered by a world community that made a \r\nshared commitment to deliver peace to a country and \r\na subregion beset by civil conflict and cross-border \r\ndestabilization. The United Nations and its partner \r\nnations were of one mind, and from that global unity \r\na new democratic Liberian State was born. Liberia is \r\na post-conflict success story. It is the Organization’s \r\npost-conflict success story.\r\nAs I bid farewell to the Assembly today, and to my \r\nfellow Heads of State, I have a few parting thoughts.\r\nFirst, remember Liberia, which is making vibrant \r\nefforts to apply the tenets of democracy. Consider \r\nthe lives saved, the wealth created, the stability \r\nassured because this global body led at a time of great \r\nuncertainty in our subregion and around the world. I ask \r\nthe States Members of the United Nations to continue to \r\nlead, to spread the values of democracy, human rights \r\nand good governance, while strengthening solidarity \r\nfor economic transformation and social resilience. It is \r\noften in times of transition that great leaders emerge \r\nand institutions are strengthened.\r\nSecondly, I recall that two years ago, at its seventieth \r\nsession, the Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, which includes 17 Goals that \r\nencapsulate the aspirations of Member States to eradicate \r\npoverty and reduce, if not eliminate, inequalities within \r\nand between countries. Our commitment to achieving \r\nthe Goals must be unwavering, because progress in \r\nthat area is inextricably linked to ending conflict and \r\nsustaining peace.\r\nThirdly, real progress remains elusive in the \r\nlingering effort to reform the Security Council and make \r\nit more responsive to current global realities. The call \r\nfor that reform must be pursued more robustly towards \r\nan early conclusion. Africa’s views are well articulated \r\nin the Ezulwini Consensus. Today African nations are \r\nparticipating in strong regional and subregional bodies, \r\nwhich are evolving — adopting measures to secure \r\nand preserve peace and security, while strengthening \r\neconomic integration.\r\nThe United Nations, as the pre-eminent world \r\nbody, must also continue to evolve to more effectively \r\nserve the common interests of all Member States. It \r\nmust continue to chart the way forward. In its capable \r\nhands rest the hope and aspirations for a more just, \r\npeaceful and humane world, for the sake of our people \r\nand our planet.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Liberia for the statement she has \r\njust made.\r\nMrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Emmanuel Macron, President of \r\nthe French Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe French Republic.\r\nMr. Emmanuel Macron, President of the \r\nFrench Republic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Emmanuel \r\nMacron, President of the French Republic, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Macron (spoke in French): I am \r\nprivileged to address the General Assembly, and I \r\nknow to whom I owe this privilege. I owe it to all those \r\nwho, just over 70 years ago, rose up against a barbaric \r\nregime that had seized my country, France. I owe it to \r\nthe nations that heard the cry of those who resisted and \r\nthat from the Americas, Africa, Oceania and Asia sent \r\ntheir sons and daughters to France to help. Not all of \r\nthem were familiar with France, but they knew that \r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n4/28 17-29122\r\nFrance’s defeat would also mean the defeat of the ideals \r\nthey shared. They were proud of those ideals and were \r\nprepared to die to uphold them. They knew that their \r\nfreedom and values were dependent upon the freedom \r\nof other men and other women living thousands of \r\nkilometres from them.\r\nI owe the privilege to those who, once the war had \r\nended, dared to attempt reconciliation and built a new \r\ninternational order. I owe it to people who, like René \r\nCassin, understood that human rights were at the very \r\ncore of international legitimacy. I owe it to people who \r\nbrought the guilty to justice, tended to the victims and \r\nrectified mistakes. I owe it to those who believed that \r\nthe values that the war had trampled must be restored \r\nto their rightful place.\r\nTolerance, freedom and humanity are the values \r\non which the United Nations was built. And it was not \r\nbecause those values were beautiful but rather because \r\nthey were just and made it possible to avoid the worst.\r\nI do not speak of all this merely to talk about history, \r\nbut because today I hear several of our colleagues \r\ntalking about the future of our world, and forgetting \r\nsomewhat where we have come from. What might seem \r\nexotic and far removed from our immediate interests is \r\nperhaps what determines and will determine most what \r\nlies ahead for us.\r\nMy country might have a unique place in the \r\ninternational order, but that means that it is also \r\nindebted to all those whose voices have gone unheard. I \r\nknow that the duty of France is to speak for those whose \r\nvoices are not heard. If we speak for them, we also \r\nspeak for ourselves — now and for the future. Today I \r\nwould like to speak for those forgotten voices.\r\nI have heard Bana, who lives in Aleppo and whose \r\nvoice I want to bring here. She has lived under the \r\nhorror of bombings, of police and militia. She has lived \r\nin refugee camps. The Syrian people have suffered \r\nenough for the international community to acknowledge \r\nits collective failure and to question its methods.\r\nTo achieve just and lasting peace, we must focus \r\nurgently on a political settlement to the crisis by way \r\nof a transition, as the Security Council has called for \r\nthrough its unanimous adoption of resolution 2254 \r\n(2015). France and its partners have taken the initiative \r\nto support the efforts of the United Nations and to \r\ndesign, finally, an inclusive political road map for \r\nSyria. That is why I hope that we can establish a contact \r\ngroup made up of all of the five permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council and relevant stakeholders.\r\nThe so-called Astana process can be useful, but it is \r\nnot enough, and the past few days have revealed many \r\nproblems. We have to give ourselves the resources we \r\nreally need to begin negotiations, because the solution \r\nwill ultimately be a political rather than a military \r\none. It is in the interests of all of us and, of course, in \r\nSyrians’ interests above all.\r\nIn that context, I have already stated what our two \r\nred lines are. First, France will not waver where the use \r\nof chemical weapons is concerned. The perpetrators of \r\nthe attack of 4 April must be brought to international \r\njustice, and that must never happen again. Secondly, \r\nit is absolutely crucial to ensure access to health care \r\nfor all men and women and enable medical facilities \r\nto protect civilians. France will make this one of the \r\npriorities of its presidency of the Security Council \r\nnext month.\r\nWhen we act to achieve peace in Syria we are \r\nacting for the Syrian people, but we are also doing it \r\nto protect all of us against Islamist terrorism, because \r\nwhat we are primarily fighting in Syria and in Iraq is \r\nterrorism. We are acting for all who perished in attacks \r\nin recent months, because jihadi terrorism has struck \r\nour fellow citizens across all continents, regardless of \r\nreligion. We must therefore protect ourselves by joining \r\nforces, and security must become our first priority. That \r\nis the focus of the initiatives that France has launched \r\nfor combating terrorists’ use of the Internet and all \r\ntheir financing sources. That is why I hope we can \r\norganize a conference in 2018 on this effort, which I \r\nurge everyone here to become involved in. It is also the \r\nfocus of the military action that France has undertaken \r\nas part of the coalition in Syria and Iraq, in accordance \r\nwith international law. We are fighting terrorism not \r\nonly on the military and diplomatic fronts but on the \r\neducational, cultural and moral fronts, too. It is part \r\nof our efforts in Asia as well as in the Middle East and \r\nAfrica. And it must bring all of us together.\r\nI have listened to Ousman, a schoolboy in Gao, \r\nand I would like to bring his voice in here today. \r\nOusman is growing up in Mali under constant \r\nthreat from indiscriminate attacks, and yet his only \r\ndream is to be able to go to school without risking \r\nhis life. We are now all engaged in the Sahel — the \r\nUnited Nations, the countries of the region that are \r\nparticipating in the United Nations Multidimensional \r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 5/28\r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and the Force \r\nconjointe du G5 Sahel, and the European Union and its \r\nmember States. And I would like to pay tribute to all \r\nstakeholders by acknowledging that it is an extremely \r\ndifficult challenge with a high cost in human lives. Our \r\nchallenge there is, again, eliminating terrorism and, \r\nin order to do that, building national capacities so that \r\nStates can take charge of their security themselves. \r\nRegardless of the resources we put there, our collective \r\neffort will not succeed if the countries that are most \r\naffected are unable to take on their own responsibilities \r\nin that regard.\r\nThat is why I have supported the deployment of \r\nthe Force conjointe du G5 Sahel since my first day in \r\noffice, and I urge everyone here to mobilize collectively \r\nto that end, too. This is also why I want to invest in \r\nstrengthening our support to African peacekeeping \r\nmissions, because that is the future. We must all \r\ngive new thought to the links between peacekeeping, \r\nregional organizations and host countries. Our capacity \r\nto respond to our peoples’ aspirations for peace \r\ndepends on it. Certainly, a military response can never \r\nbe the only response. Here I would like to emphasize \r\nthe importance of a political response, and in that \r\nregard I have in mind the implementation of the Algiers \r\nAgreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali and \r\nour development policy.\r\nI have also listened to Kouamé, and I want to bring \r\nhis voice in here today. Left on the roadside, he crossed \r\nAfrica before putting his fate in the hands of smugglers \r\nin Libya. He crossed the Mediterranean and came \r\nsafely to port when so many others perished at sea. The \r\nrefugee, the displaced person and the person to whom \r\nwe give the sad name of migrant has truly become the \r\nsymbol of our age, of a world where we will never be \r\nable to halt the march of despair if we cannot turn the \r\nroads of necessity into roads of liberty. Such migrations \r\nare the result of politics, climate change or ethnic \r\nconflict. They are always the roads taken by necessity. \r\nToday necessity is a f light from the persecution of \r\nwhich the Rohingya — more than 400,000 refugees, \r\nmost of them children — are victims. The military \r\noperations there must cease, access to humanitarian \r\naid must be provided and the rule of law must be \r\nre-established because, as we know, what is going on is \r\nethnic cleansing. France will take the initiative on this \r\nissue in the Security Council.\r\nNecessity means leaving to save one’s family when \r\nwar is raging and when international humanitarian law \r\nis no longer respected but becomes a tool to be exploited \r\nin the warring parties’ strategy of violence, as it is in \r\nSyria. It means exile when the defenders of freedom are \r\nthe first to be targeted by the powers that be. Protecting \r\nrefugees is a moral and political duty and one in which \r\nFrance is resolved to play its part, by supporting the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\nwherever he has to intervene; by opening legal paths \r\nto resettlement in areas closest to the conflict zones \r\nin Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey as well as in the Niger \r\nand Chad; and by defending the right to asylum and \r\nunequivocal respect for the Geneva Conventions.\r\nIn Paris on 28 August, we brought together the \r\nAfrican and European countries that have been most \r\ndirectly affected by the migration f lows along the \r\ncentral Mediterranean route. We adopted a road map \r\nwhose priority is combating the smugglers who traffic \r\nin despair. We must put an end to these intolerable \r\nviolations of fundamental human rights by working with \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees and the International Organization for \r\nMigration to establish a humanitarian infrastructure \r\nand by helping countries of origin and transit to better \r\ncontrol migration f lows.\r\nBut while short-term responses are a necessity for \r\nmanaging crises when we are dealing with terrorism and \r\nmigration, what is at stake today is our ability to muster \r\nthe political will to address the underlying causes of \r\nthese sources of instability. Migration and terrorism \r\nrepresent the biggest political challenges that all of us \r\nmay ever face. If we are to overcome such moral and \r\ncivilizational challenges, it will be by pursuing a true \r\npolicy of development, which is why I have decided that \r\nFrance should play its part by devoting 0.55 per cent of \r\nnational revenue to public development aid for the next \r\nfive years.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nI am grateful for the applause, but I have to temper \r\nit somewhat — first, because I know that some people \r\nwere expecting more, that such aid is never enough, \r\nand that France’s response is still not enough, but \r\nmainly because it is not money that is the real issue; \r\nit is how effectively that money is used. It is what we \r\nspend the money on. It is about how we can be better \r\nat evaluating and taking responsibility for the money \r\nthat we all contribute. Of course, I want France to do \r\nits part with development aid, but what I really want \r\nis for us to bring more innovation and intelligence to \r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n6/28 17-29122\r\nour aid, using different methods and taking on greater \r\nresponsibility on the ground. That is what I want. The \r\nchallenge we have today is in ensuring that development \r\naid actually reaches the areas where it is needed, simply \r\nand efficiently, calculated correctly and for the purpose \r\nit was designed for. That was what we wanted to do \r\nwith the Alliance for the Sahel, for example, which we \r\nlaunched with the European Union, the World Bank and \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme.\r\nWe also have to set clear priorities. The first is \r\ninvesting in education, because it is education that will \r\nhelp us win the fight against the obscurantism that is \r\nbringing down entire countries and regions today, both \r\nin Africa and the Middle East. I urge the international \r\ncommunity to step up in February 2018 in Dakar when \r\nwe re-establish the World Partnership for Education, \r\nwhich France will co-chair with Senegal. This is a key \r\nstruggle for us all. We must give girls and boys the \r\nopportunity to escape obscurantism and to choose their \r\nown future, not the future imposed upon them or the \r\none that we in this Hall would choose for them.\r\nOur second priority is to invest in health and \r\ncombat major pandemics and malnutrition, because \r\nwithout education or health there can be no hope. In \r\nthis fight for development, we must also support the \r\nrole of women, culture and freedom of expression. \r\nWherever the role of women is undermined, there, too, \r\ndevelopment is undermined, as is a society’s ability \r\nto assume its rightful place in the world. These are \r\nnot trivial issues; this is a deep-seated civilizational \r\nstruggle. It is our struggle and these are our values, \r\nwhich are not relative but universal on all continents \r\nand at all latitudes. Wherever culture is undermined, \r\nthere, too, our collective ability to rise to challenges \r\nis undermined.\r\nThat is why UNESCO is today such an important \r\norganization and has such a key role to play with \r\nrespect to ensuring a human face for the world at a \r\ntime when widespread obscurantism seeks to eradicate \r\nits unbelievable diversity. We are fighting so that all \r\ncultures and languages can be preserved and so that \r\nprogress can continue to be made.\r\nFreedom of expression, too, is a most urgent \r\nissue. The United Nations must protect the freedom \r\nof those who think, reflect and express themselves, in \r\nparticular the freedom of the press. For that reason, I \r\ncall for the appointment of a Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General for the protection of journalists \r\nthroughout the world; neither the fight against terrorism \r\nnor the more demanding world we are living in can \r\njustify any inroads upon that freedom.\r\nFinally, I wish to speak on behalf of my fellow \r\nFrenchman Jules, who lives on the island of St. Martin. \r\nI am thinking of his house, which lies in ruins, and of \r\nhis fear that this may happen again because of climate \r\nchange, which is leading to an increasing number of \r\ndisasters. The future of the world is that of our planet, \r\nwhich is now taking revenge for the folly of humankind. \r\nNature is calling us to task to shoulder our responsibility \r\nof humanity and solidarity. It will not negotiate with \r\nus, and humankind must defend itself by protecting it. \r\nExtreme weather events are exploding the traditional \r\ndifferences between the North and the South. The most \r\nfragile are always the principal victims, swept up in a \r\nwhirlwind of injustice. We are all affected by climatic \r\nchanges, from China to the Caribbean, in Russia and in \r\nthe Horn of Africa.\r\nMy country promised, before the Assembly, that \r\nwe would achieve a universal agreement in Paris. That \r\nwe did and signed it in this very Hall. That agreement \r\nis not up for renegotiation. It binds us and rallies us \r\ntogether. To take it apart would mean unraveling a pact \r\nnot just between States but also between generations. \r\nIt can be improved; we can have new contributions and \r\nfresh input, but we will not backtrack.\r\nI fully respect the decision of the United States. \r\nThe door will always be open to it. However, we will \r\ncontinue our work, along with all Governments, local \r\ngovernments, cities, businesses, non-governmental \r\norganizations and citizens of the world. We have the \r\nstrength of pioneers, endurance and the certainty and \r\nenergy of those who wish to build a better world. That \r\nbetter world will lead to innovation and job creation, \r\ndespite the beliefs of those who see the future only in \r\nterms of the past.\r\nWe will build such a world right now by making our \r\nnational contributions, as France has done by adopting \r\nits climate plan, which places us on the road to carbon \r\nneutrality. On 12 December, we will be meeting in \r\nParis with those who wish to move forward with real \r\nsolutions by mobilizing public and private funding. \r\nHere I confirm that France will play its full role in \r\nthis respect by allocating €5 billion per year to climate \r\naction between now and 2020.\r\nOur unfolding ambition is reflected in the fact that \r\nthis very afternoon we will be introducing a global pact \r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 7/28\r\nfor the environment aimed at shaping international law \r\nfor the coming century, with the support of the United \r\nNations agencies.\r\nAt a time when some would wish us to stop, we \r\nmust continue to advance, because climate change \r\nand extreme weather events will not stop. Our duty of \r\nsolidarity and humanity will continue.\r\nBehind every one of our decisions are the voices \r\nand lives of the invisible masses whom we must defend, \r\nbecause we in turn were defended in the past. Why do \r\nwe not heed those voices? Why are we not focusing \r\non what 70 years ago gave humankind the strength to \r\nbelieve in itself: planetary responsibility, the desire for \r\nmutual assistance and faith in progress?\r\nWhen I speak of Bana, Ousman, Kouamé and Jules, \r\nI speak about all my compatriots and everyone else’s \r\ncompatriots, because our security is their security. We \r\nare inextricably linked in a community of fate, today \r\nand tomorrow. Global balances have changed radically \r\nin recent years and the world has become multipolar \r\nonce again, so we must learn anew the complexity of \r\ndialogue as well as the riches it can bring to us.\r\nOur collective action is coming up against obstacles \r\nstemming from State instability. In Libya, six years \r\nafter the military intervention there, I acknowledge, \r\nbefore the Assembly, France’s particular responsibility \r\nto ensure that the country regains its stability. The \r\nmeeting held in La Celle-Saint-Cloud on 25 July \r\nenabled us to make progress on the reconciliation \r\nnecessary for the success of the political process under \r\nthe auspices of the United Nations. Together with the \r\nSecretary-General and his Special Representative, we \r\nmust succeed in 2018 in organizing elections that will \r\nmark the restoration of effective State authority. I will \r\ndo my utmost to achieve that.\r\nConcerning Venezuela, collective action must \r\nenable the upholding of democracy and respect for \r\nall political movements. We must give no ground to \r\nthe dictatorial trends that we see today. In Ukraine, \r\ntoo, we must tirelessly work to ensure the upholding \r\nof the commitments undertaken, bring about an \r\neffective ceasefire and work together with our partners, \r\nparticularly Germany, to ensure that the parties to the \r\nconflict respect international law and end the conflict.\r\nMultilateralism is facing the challenge of nuclear \r\nproliferation, unable to ward off threats that we believed \r\nto be past but that have re-emerged today. Pyongyang \r\nhas crossed a major threshold in terms of military \r\nescalation. This is an urgent, collective existential \r\nthreat. North Korea has not to date given any sign of \r\nwishing to negotiate. Its authorities are determined to \r\nraise the stakes. Our responsibility, together with all of \r\nour partners, including China and Russia, is, through \r\nresolve, to bring North Korea to the negotiating table \r\nfor a political settlement to this conflict. France rejects \r\nescalation and will not close any door to dialogue, \r\nprovided that the conditions are met for such a dialogue \r\nto promote peace.\r\nIt is that same goal that impels me to defend the \r\nnuclear agreement with Iran. Our commitment to \r\nnuclear non-proliferation enabled us to reach a solid, \r\nrobust and verifiable agreement on 14 July 2015 and \r\nto ensure that Iran will not be able to acquire nuclear \r\nweapons. To denounce that now without proposing \r\nanything in its place would be a serious mistake, and \r\nfailing to uphold it would be irresponsible, because it \r\nis a helpful agreement that is vital to keeping the peace \r\nat a time when the risk of a collapse into a death spiral \r\nis genuine. That is what I told the United States and \r\nIran yesterday. For my part, I hope that we will be able \r\nto fulfil the agreement, by working to contain Iran’s \r\nballistic activity and manage the situation after 2020, \r\nwhich the 2015 agreement does not cover. Let us by \r\nall means be more demanding, but certainly not by \r\nunwinding the results that previous agreements have \r\nalready achieved. Look at the mess we are in today. \r\nHas the lack of dialogue done anything to contain \r\nthe situation in North Korea for even a moment? \r\nWhat I want for all of us is a world where dialogue, \r\ncontrols and multilateralism provide us with effective, \r\nuseful weapons.\r\nI do not know whether, 70 years from now, a future \r\nsuccessor of mine will have the privilege of addressing \r\nthe Assembly. Will multilateralism survive the time \r\nof doubt and change that we are going through? The \r\nfact is that we should be remembering the state that \r\nthe world was in 70 years ago, shattered by war and \r\nstunned by genocides. Right now we need to rediscover \r\nthe optimism, ambition and courage with which we met \r\nthose reasons to doubt and the faith in what unites us. \r\nWe must restore our trust in the universal founding \r\nprinciples of the United Nations, which protect all of us \r\nand guarantee our dignity, all over the world.\r\nBut why have we ended up where we are? Because we \r\nhave allowed the idea to take root that multilateralism is \r\na kind of convenient game for diplomats around a table, \r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n8/28 17-29122\r\na tool of the weak. That has gone on for years, because \r\nwe let ourselves believe that our efforts were stronger \r\nand more convincing when we acted unilaterally. But \r\nit is not true. Because, sometimes out of cynicism, \r\nwe let ourselves believe that multilateralism could \r\nnot fix everything, and so we let deregulation of the \r\nworld take over. We have been slow to address climate \r\nchange and the new inequalities that unregulated \r\ncapitalism creates. We have let the voices of discord \r\nshout the loudest. And in that game, the loudest voices \r\nwin. Time and fading memory have made us forget \r\nthe history that moulded us and allowed the belief to \r\ntake root that we are stronger without multilateralism. \r\nThe challenge that our generation faces today is to be \r\nable to get our faith back and to show that in today’s \r\nworld, nothing is more effective than multilateralism. \r\nAnd why? Because every one of our challenges is \r\nglobal — terrorism, immigration, climate change, the \r\nregulation of the digital world. They all have to be \r\naddressed multilaterally and on a global scale.\r\nEvery time we turn away from multilateralism, \r\nthe loudest voice wins. But it is only through \r\nmultilateralism that we can achieve our vision of the \r\nworld, because it is universal, not regional. Every \r\ntime we give up on an idea — for example, that the \r\nsituation of women concerns some people in parts of \r\nthe world but not others, or that equality is an issue for \r\none civilization but not others — we are abandoning the \r\nuniversality of the values that have brought us together \r\nin this Organization. In some countries we have already \r\nceded the race to the strong. And that is because, every \r\ntime, the great Powers, seated around the Security \r\nCouncil table, have ceded the race to the strong and to \r\nunilateralism, and have failed to live up to agreements \r\nthey signed themselves. They have failed to uphold the \r\nglue that keeps multilateralism together — the rule \r\nof law. That is what has got us this far and can build \r\nsustainable peace.\r\nToday we need multilateralism more than ever, not \r\nbecause it is a comforting notion, and not because it \r\nis somewhere for thinking people to take shelter, but \r\nbecause it is about the rule of law, about interaction \r\nbetween peoples and about equality for us all. It is \r\nwhat will enable us to achieve peace and overcome \r\nour challenges. And the United Nations is indeed \r\nthe Organization that can act in full legitimacy to \r\npreserve global equilibrium. That is why I want a more \r\nresponsible, effective and agile United Nations, and \r\nwhy I fully support the Secretary-General’s plans for \r\nthe Organization and his ambition and commitment \r\nto making it equal to the challenges facing our world. \r\nWe need to get out of our offices and away from \r\nmeetings with States and Governments and to seek new \r\nresources, so that we can see the world as it really is \r\nand reconsider some of the dogmas to which we have \r\nsometimes clung. We need a Security Council that \r\ncan make effective decisions, without walling itself \r\noff through its right to the veto when mass atrocities \r\nare being committed. We need better representation \r\nfor everyone here and for every continent. We need to \r\ncoordinate crisis management better with the European \r\nUnion, the African Union and the key subregional \r\norganizations. That is why France will stand beside the \r\nUnited Nations as it implements reform.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that it is only in \r\na stronghold such as this that the forgotten voices that \r\nI wanted to bring here today can be heard, a stronghold \r\nwhere there is a place for everyone and where everyone \r\ncan be heard even by those who do not wish to hear. \r\nTo them I say that a refusal to listen to the oppressed, \r\nto victims, allows their miseries to grow and prosper \r\nuntil the day when they overwhelm all the rest of us as \r\nwell. A refusal to listen means forgetting that at one \r\ntime or another in our history, we were the oppressed, \r\nand others heard our voices. It means forgetting that \r\nour safety and security is theirs too, that their lives are \r\nconnected to ours, and we cannot remain unscathed in \r\na world that is going up in f lames. A refusal to listen to \r\nthose who call for help means believing that walls and \r\nborders will protect us. \r\nBut it is not walls that protect us, it is our \r\nwillingness to act and to change the course of history \r\nand our refusal to allow history to be written without \r\nus even as we imagine we are safe. It is our sovereignty \r\nand our sovereign use of force in the service of progress \r\nthat protects us. A nation’s independence lies in its \r\ninterdependence. A refusal to listen to those voices \r\nwould mean believing that their despair is not ours, \r\nthat we will always enjoy benefits that they can only \r\ndream of. But what if those benefits are our whole \r\nplanet — what if they are peace, justice and freedom? \r\nDo we believe that we are the only ones who should \r\nenjoy them, tucked away in some corner? If we do not \r\ndefend those shared benefits, we will all be doomed. \r\nWe will be watching fires burn that history will blow \r\nback on our own children tomorrow.\r\nToday, more than ever, those shared benefits, \r\nour common goods, represent our shared interests. \r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 9/28\r\nOur security is their security, and there are no sides, \r\nno division between those who believe in the rule \r\nof law and multilateralism and those who believe \r\nin a pragmatic unilateralism. That is a false notion. \r\nOur real effectiveness is playing out in this struggle \r\nright here. That is why I want to join with everyone \r\nhere today, united in a belief in a strong, responsible \r\nmultilateralism. That is our generation’s responsibility, \r\nif we do not want to abandon ourselves to fatalism. \r\nThere is only one kind of courage we need, which is to \r\nlisten to those voices and not to deviate from the mark \r\nwe wish to leave on history. We must be constantly \r\naware that we must work to reconcile our interests \r\nand our values. Our security is the common good of \r\nour planet. Our generation has no choice. It must speak \r\nfor today and for tomorrow.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the French Republic for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Emmanuel Macron, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Juan Manuel Santos \r\nCalderón, President of the Republic of Colombia.\r\nMr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Santos Calderón (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThis is the eighth and last time I address the General \r\nAssembly in my capacity as President of Colombia. \r\nA lot has happened since 24 September 2010, when \r\nI made my first speech (see A/65/PV.15). Colombia \r\nhas been transformed positively, and the world has \r\nexperienced progress and setbacks, of which we have \r\nall been witnesses, victims or protagonists.\r\nHere is a paradox: I did my first televised address to \r\nColombians as their leader from New York in September \r\n2010, one day before addressing the Assembly. What \r\nwas the reason for that intervention? I announced to \r\nColombia and to the international community that our \r\narmed forces had taken down the head of the guerrillas \r\nof the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia \r\n(FARC). Today, seven years later, I feel very happy that \r\nthe news I bring from Colombia does not have to do with \r\ndeath, but with life. Today I come to tell the Assembly \r\nthat the peace process with the FARC culminated not \r\nonly in an agreement, but with something bigger and \r\nmore important: thousands and thousands of human \r\nlives saved.\r\nTherefore, the news today is not about death. It \r\nis about life, and we want that to be the news in the \r\nwhole world. If in Colombia we were able to end an \r\narmed conflict that left hundreds of thousands dead \r\nand millions as victims and displaced persons, there \r\nis hope for the conflicts that still exist in the world. \r\nIt was not easy. Ending a war, overcoming hatred and \r\nvanquishing fears involve a complex process of dialogue \r\nand compromise. However, we did it because we had \r\nthe will and because we were aware of a fundamental \r\npremise: peace is a necessary condition for progress \r\nand the happiness of any society.\r\nI want to acknowledge and thank the United \r\nNations, because it has fully fulfilled the mission \r\nfor which it was created, which is none other than to \r\nend the scourge of war. On behalf of some 50 million \r\nColombians, I want to thank the Secretary-General, the \r\nSecurity Council and the Assembly.\r\nA special mission set up by the Security Council \r\nwas in charge of verifying and monitoring the FARC \r\ndisarmament process and its compliance with the \r\nceasefire and the cessation of hostilities between that \r\ngroup and the Colombian State. Today we can say, \r\nwith immense satisfaction, that its mission has been \r\nfulfilled. The ceasefire and cessation of hostilities \r\nwere respected, and the FARC delivered to the United \r\nNations more than 9,000 weapons that were stored in \r\ncontainers. Those weapons are being destroyed. The \r\nmembers of that former guerrilla group — without \r\ndetriment to their responsibilities with regard to justice \r\nand to the victims — have now formed a political \r\nmovement to defend their ideas and proposals in the \r\nforums of democracy.\r\nThat is what a peace process is all about: replacing \r\nviolence with reasoning, exchanging bullets for votes. \r\nNever again will arms be used as a means of political \r\npressure. Now we are faced with the challenge of \r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n10/28 17-29122\r\nimplementing what has been agreed and guaranteeing \r\nvictims’ rights to truth, justice, reparations and \r\nnon-repetition.\r\nMr. Tevi (Vanuatu), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nIn that regard, we can once again count on the \r\nfriendly hand of the United Nations. In a few days, a \r\nsecond mission, authorized last week by the Security \r\nCouncil, will begin operations in our country. It will \r\naccompany the reintegration of guerrillas into civilian \r\nlife and will help us to verify the safety of ex-combatants \r\nand the communities that have suffered from the armed \r\nconflict. And something very important: the United \r\nNations will also verify compliance with the ceasefire \r\nand the temporary cessation of hostilities, which \r\nwill begin 1 October, by the Ejército de Liberación \r\nNacional, the other guerrilla group with which we are \r\nin negotiations to achieve a complete peace.\r\nBuilding peace is a long process with political, \r\neconomic and social dimensions. It is a process in which, \r\nfortunately, we have already had positive results. With \r\ninnovative programmes in education, health, housing \r\nand infrastructure, we are beginning to close the deep \r\nsocial gaps of our society.\r\nThe Economic Commission for Latin America has \r\nhighlighted Colombia’s progress in reducing poverty \r\nand indigence. In seven years, more than 5 million \r\nColombians overcame poverty — that is more than a \r\ntenth of our population. We have turned health into a \r\nfundamental right, and education has been our highest \r\nbudgetary priority for the past four years, above security \r\nand defence. International organizations also highlight \r\nthe soundness of our economic and social indicators in \r\nthe face of f luctuations in the global economy.\r\nThis is indeed a special moment for Colombia, \r\nand a special moment for the United Nations, which is \r\nsuccessfully fulfilling, in our country, its main objective.\r\nBut this time of hope in Colombia does not prevent \r\nus from viewing with concern the difficult situations \r\nfor peace and democracy in other parts of the planet. \r\nWe emphatically deplore and condemn the ballistic-\r\nmissile launches and the nuclear tests of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. Those actions are a threat \r\nto international peace and security.\r\nWe are very concerned about the precarious \r\nsituation in our sister and neighbour Republic of \r\nVenezuela, with which we share an immense border, \r\na common history and human ties that do not allow us \r\nto be indifferent to its fate. Venezuela pains us. We are \r\npained at the gradual destruction of its democracy. We \r\nare pained at the persecution of the political opposition \r\nand the systematic violation of the rights of Venezuelans. \r\nToday I repeat my call on the Secretary-General and \r\nthe entire international community to support the \r\nVenezuelan people in the search for a peaceful solution \r\nthat will return them to the path of progress, democracy \r\nand freedom.\r\nWe are also pained at the terrorist attacks carried \r\nout by intolerant fanatics, sowing fear and pain, and we \r\ncondemn them. On that topic I would like to speak in \r\ntwo capacities: as President of the only country where \r\ninstead of increasing weaponry we melt them to build \r\nmonuments to harmony, and as the most recent Nobel \r\nPeace Prize recipient.\r\nBeyond the differences of race, religion and \r\nthought, human beings are actually one. What happens \r\nto one happens to us all. We have to understand that \r\nbeyond divisions, beyond borders, our people is called \r\nthe world. Our race is called humankind. We must \r\nunderstand this truth if we are to respect one another \r\nand respect life.\r\nWe must fight terrorism forcefully — with military \r\nand police power, with intelligence and international \r\ncooperation. But we must also eradicate its roots, \r\nwhich are fear, exclusion and hatred, with the positive \r\nforces of love, compassion and respect for differences. \r\nIn Colombia we are proving that it is possible; war can \r\nbe overcome. Ancient enemies can speak and work \r\ntogether for a greater cause. If we are succeeding in \r\nColombia, it can be done all over the world.\r\nI cannot conclude without addressing an issue that I \r\nhave highlighted before at this rostrum: the world drug \r\nproblem. I have said many times that the war on drugs \r\nhas not been won and is not being won, that we need \r\nnew approaches and new strategies.\r\nAt the General Assembly’s thirtieth special session, \r\non the world drug problem — which met last year at \r\nthe initiative of Colombia — there was progress, such \r\nas the call for States to protect human rights in their \r\ndrug policies. But we still have a great deal to do. We \r\nmust reach consensus on central issues, such as not \r\ncriminalizing addicts and understanding drug use as a \r\nmatter of public health and not criminal policy.\r\nThe war on drugs has claimed too many lives. \r\nWe in Colombia have paid a very high price, perhaps \r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 11/28\r\nthe highest of any nation, and what we are seeing is \r\nthat the remedy is often worse than the disease. Let \r\nus undertake a serious and rigorous follow-up of the \r\nregulatory experiences that have been implemented in \r\ndifferent places and learn from both their successes and \r\ntheir difficulties.\r\nIt is time to accept realistically that as long as \r\nthere is consumption there will be supply, and that \r\nconsumption will not end. It is not a simplistic matter of \r\npointing out who is solely responsible. We all are, under \r\nthe principle of the common and shared responsibility \r\nthat we assumed several decades ago. It is time to talk \r\nabout responsible regulation by States, to seek ways to \r\nweaken the mafias and to confront consumption with \r\nmore resources for prevention, care and reduction of \r\ndamage to health and to the social fabric. Colombia will \r\ncontinue to fight this scourge decisively. For us it has \r\nbeen and continues to be a matter of national security.\r\nPeace has allowed us for the first time to initiate \r\nthe process of voluntary substitution of coca crops. \r\nThose processes, along with the forced eradication we \r\nare promoting and the seizures, which have increased \r\nto unprecedented levels, will allow us to achieve results \r\nthat are even more conclusive and long-term. But we \r\nmust advance in this struggle with a more open mind. \r\nWe have to be smarter and more innovative.\r\nWe can say much the same about climate change. \r\nColombia, the most biodiverse country in the world for its \r\nsize, is also one of the most vulnerable to climate change. \r\nThat is why we have been proactive on this matter. At \r\nthe Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development we \r\npushed for the adoption of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, which the Assembly approved in 2015. Today we \r\nare pleased to see that those Goals are the backbone \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\npromoted by the United Nations.\r\nWe also enthusiastically support the Paris Climate \r\nAgreement, whose goals are a national commitment and \r\nshould be for all if we want to preserve our common \r\nhome — the Earth. Humankind cannot close its eyes \r\nin the face of the most pressing challenge of our times.\r\nIn this, my last statement before the General \r\nAssembly, I want to offer the world — with humility \r\nand much gratitude — the example and model of \r\npeace that we are beginning to build in Colombia. And \r\nI want to reiterate our gratitude for the international \r\ncommunity’s generous support.\r\nWith the strength of love we can overcome fear. \r\nWith the strength of life we can overcome the tyranny \r\nof violence and death. With the strength of unity we can \r\nmake the world a decent place to live.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan.\r\nMr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Emomali Rahmon, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Tajikistan, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rahmon (spoke in Tajik; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): I wish to join my colleagues, \r\nHeads of State and Government, in congratulating \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election as the President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, \r\nand to wish him every success in his noble duties. I also \r\nexpress my sincere appreciation to Mr. Peter Thomson \r\nfor his continued support of Tajikistan’s national and \r\ninternational commitments during his term as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-first session.\r\nUnprecedented rapid globalization over the past \r\ndecades has contributed to the development of political \r\nand economic relationships among countries and \r\nhelped bolster the integration of various regions across \r\nthe world. It has also brought massive challenges to the \r\nworld’s people and sometimes undermines the efforts \r\nof Member States to ensure a safe, fair and secure life \r\nfor their people. In this context, the United Nations, as \r\na universal institution, should continue to carry out its \r\nnoble mission of coordinating the efforts of Member \r\nStates to strengthen countries’ resilience in responding \r\nto modern threats and challenges.\r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n12/28 17-29122\r\nIt is impossible to address the new challenges facing \r\nthe international community without strengthening \r\nand reforming the entire United Nation system. \r\nComprehensive and inclusive reform of the United \r\nNations must contribute to increasing and strengthening \r\nits capacity to respond to developments around the world \r\nin a timely manner and to deal with today’s threats and \r\nrisks. United Nations reform should be implemented \r\nin accordance with the principles and purposes of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We support the inclusive \r\nand equal representation of the interests of developing \r\ncountries in the Security Council reform process.\r\nWe are witnessing today many tragic and horrific \r\nevents taking place across the globe that undermine the \r\ninternational community’s commitment to attaining \r\ncomprehensive sustainable development. The spread \r\nof terrorism and extremism, religious armed conflicts, \r\ntransnational organized crime and drug trafficking \r\npose serious challenges to the security of our countries.\r\nAs terrorist and extremist groups and movements \r\nf lourish in many hot spots throughout the world, \r\nthreatening people’s security by using certain corners \r\nof the world as safe havens, I wish to reiterate that the \r\nhorror and brutal acts of these forces have absolutely \r\nno connection with the holy religion of Islam. On the \r\ncontrary, they run counter to the moral teachings and \r\ndo not reflect the tolerance and values of Islam. In order \r\nto confront these threats, all Member States must make \r\nevery effort, in accordance with international law, and \r\navoid double standards.\r\nThe Government of Tajikistan continues to take \r\nconcrete steps to address threats and challenges and to \r\nensure lasting peace and overall stability in the country, \r\nin cooperation with its partners and international \r\norganizations, in particular the relevant United Nations \r\nagencies. The implementation of the second phase of \r\nour National Strategy on Countering Extremism and \r\nTerrorism 2016-2020 is one effective instrument we \r\nuse to fulfil our commitments. I should emphasize \r\nthat these efforts are aimed at supporting the United \r\nNations central coordinating role in assisting countries \r\nin post-conflict rehabilitation processes.\r\nThe success of our joint actions to prevent and \r\nresolve conflict and to seek the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes will depend first and foremost on how \r\neffectively we use preventive diplomacy and mediation. \r\nPeace and stability can ensure sustainable, inclusive \r\ncooperation aimed at resolving the conflict in North \r\nKorea. Peace and stability can ensure sustainable \r\nsocial and economic development and a more peaceful \r\nlife, and create conditions conducive to a strong civil \r\nsociety and to respect for and the protection of human \r\nrights in all countries, facilitating the prosperity of \r\nMember States.\r\nWe Tajiks are well aware of the importance of \r\npeace and the need to defend it, since our people have \r\nexperienced many hardships and suffered through \r\na civil war in the early days of its independence. As \r\na result of the domestic conflict imposed upon them, \r\nthousands of our nationals lost their lives. Only through \r\npeace and stability have we been able to achieve \r\nsustainable economic development, reduce poverty and \r\nimprove our people’s well-being, promote cooperation \r\nwith different countries and goodwill among nations \r\nthroughout the world, and take the measures necessary \r\nto ensure regional integration.\r\nWe cannot afford to remain silent in the face of \r\nthe military, political, social and economic situation \r\nin neighbouring Afghanistan. The rapidly growing \r\nactivity of violent terrorist groups in the country has \r\nbecome a source of serious concern for us. Given the \r\ncurrent situation in that country, it is high time to take \r\nstrong measures to coordinate counter-terrorism efforts \r\nand tackle drug production and trafficking in narcotics.\r\nTajikistan supports Afghanistan’s comprehensive \r\nconflict resolution strategy. The Government and the \r\npeople of Afghanistan need timely support and targeted \r\nassistance, especially during the current transition \r\nperiod. Tajikistan’s involvement in the process of \r\nregional integration through enhanced economic and \r\ntrade relations with that country could be an important \r\nelement in helping the country move forward towards \r\npeace and stability. We call on the international \r\ncommunity to stand with and contribute to helping \r\nAfghanistan restore its ailing social and economic \r\nlife and to develop its transport and communication \r\ninfrastructure.\r\nTajikistan, which has 1,400 kilometres of border \r\nwith Afghanistan, stands ready and committed to \r\ncontribute to these noble objectives. Transport and road \r\nlinks between our countries and the implementation \r\nof the power-transmission lines projects, including the \r\nCentral Asia South Asia Electricity Transmission and \r\nTrade Project (CASA-1000), as well as the training and \r\nprofessional development of experts in different areas, \r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 13/28\r\nare among the projects that we are carrying out with \r\nthat country.\r\nFighting drug trafficking, which is one of the main \r\nsources of funding of international terrorism, calls \r\nfor the joint effort and strong will of the international \r\ncommunity to help the country get rid of this evil. \r\nTajikistan has established cooperation with the relevant \r\nUnited Nations agencies, regional organizations and \r\npartner countries at the bilateral level. We are currently \r\nsuccessfully implementing our National Strategy on \r\nCombating Illicit Drugs 2013-2020.\r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment by the international community was a \r\nkey milestone in our joint work to advance sustainable \r\ndevelopment and involve all sectors of society in \r\nthe process. Over the past few years, Tajikistan has \r\nmade great strides towards the implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. The Government of \r\nmy country, in close and effective cooperation with the \r\nrelevant United Nations agencies, has developed and \r\nadopted the Mid-Term Development Strategy 2020 and \r\nthe National Development Strategy 2016-2030. These \r\nstrategies have been developed in line with the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, and we believe \r\nthat their timely and effective implementation will \r\ncontribute to achieving the Agenda.\r\nTajikistan was among 43 countries that presented \r\ntheir voluntary national review in July at the High-\r\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development, in \r\nNew York. To achieve the successful implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda, it is necessary to help the least \r\ndeveloped countries and developing countries, \r\nparticularly by providing financial support and \r\ncutting-edge technologies, to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the geographical situation \r\nof landlocked developing countries and their lack of \r\naccess to sea ports are serious obstacles to honouring \r\ntheir commitment to achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Countries in these circumstances \r\nneed much more assistance from developed countries \r\nand international financial institutions in their efforts \r\nto develop infrastructure, improve transport systems \r\nand simplify trade policies and regional integration. \r\nThe specialized institutions and agencies of the United \r\nNations, particularly the Economic and Social Council, \r\ncan and should have an important role in this regard.\r\nWe believe that the more attention we give to \r\neconomic, social and environmental issues, the better \r\nwe can contribute to the successful implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda. That would also help countries to cope \r\nwith their social challenges and improve the livelihood \r\nand living standards of their people by providing jobs.\r\nWe, the representatives of the international \r\ncommunity, adopted the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange two years ago. The goals enshrined in that \r\ncritical document determine the major obligations and \r\nefforts of the international community in reducing \r\ncarbon dioxode emissions in the atmosphere, adaptation \r\nto climate change and transitioning to a low-carbon \r\neconomy.\r\nClimate change accelerates the melting of glaciers, \r\nwhich affects the rise of the water level in rivers and \r\nnegatively affects certain sectors of the national \r\neconomy. With 93 per cent of its territory surrounded \r\nby mountains, Tajikistan, owing to its geographical \r\nlocation, faces the devastating consequences of climate \r\nchange and natural disasters. Every year, the country \r\nsuffers from natural disasters, including those related \r\nto water. Tajikistan spends hundreds of millions of \r\ndollars to tackle and eliminate the consequences of \r\nnatural disasters.\r\nOver the past 30 years, Tajikistan has lost more than \r\n1,000 of its 13,000 glaciers due to melting as a result of \r\nclimate change and temperature rise. This comes at a \r\ntime when the industrial capability of Tajikistan, which \r\nis the main source of its carbon dioxide emissions, \r\nis not especially large. Ninety-eight per cent of the \r\ncountry’s energy is produced by hydroelectric power \r\nstations, generating environmentally friendly energy. \r\nOver 60 per cent of Central Asian water resources are \r\ncurrently formed in Tajikistan. It is obvious that the \r\naccelerated melting of glaciers adversely affects water \r\nlevels in the region.\r\nIn this regard, the time has come for us to turn \r\nour words into actions and demonstrate our resolve to \r\nimplement the goals of the Paris Agreement. In our view, \r\none way to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement is \r\nto adhere to the green economy recommmendations and \r\npromote the comprehensive use of renewable energy \r\nsources. In this context, we express our full support of \r\nthe international Sustainable Energy for All initiative \r\nand the United Nations Decade of Sustainable Energy \r\nfor All 2014-2024. It is important for the international \r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n14/28 17-29122\r\ncommunity to make vigorous efforts to achieve \r\nthese goals.\r\nTajikistan is strongly committed to maintaining \r\nits contribution to implementing the water-related \r\ngoals of the 2030 Agenda. It is with great pleasure \r\nthat I note that, in December 2016, the General \r\nAssembly adopted by consensus resolution 71/222, \r\nentitled “International Decade for Action, ‘Water for \r\nSustainable Development’, 2018-2028”. We believe that \r\nthe implementation of the new Decade at the national, \r\nregional and international levels will contribute to the \r\nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nrelated to water and help to preserve that invaluable \r\nresource for generations to come.\r\nThis morning we conducted a high-level side \r\nevent entitled “Towards Implementation of the \r\nInternational Decade of Action, ‘Water for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment’, 2018-2028”, at which participants \r\nexchanged views on ways and means to implement \r\nthe new international Decade and Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 6. Furthermore, in order to review \r\nand deliberate on proposals by development partners \r\nand with a view to adopting a road map for the Decade, \r\nwe intend to organize, on 22 March 2018, World \r\nWater Day, a special event in New York to celebrate \r\nthe launch of the international Decade and to host \r\na high-level international conference on water for \r\nsustainable development in Dushanbe next June. We \r\nstrongly believe that the States Members of the United \r\nNations, international and regional organizations, \r\ninternational financial institutions, civil society, think-\r\ntank associations, women and youth will stand together \r\nand work to achieve the Decade’s goals and objectives \r\nfor the sake of the lives of people around the globe and \r\nto ensure a better future for coming generations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nAddress by Mr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of \r\nthe Republic of Zambia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Zambia.\r\nMr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Lungu: Let me join previous speakers \r\nin congratulating His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák \r\non his assumption of the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session. I also wish to \r\nextend Zambia’s sincere appreciation to His Excellency \r\nMr. Peter Thomson for his able leadership during the \r\nseventy-first session.\r\nMay I also convey my sincere gratitude to His \r\nExcellency Mr. António Guterres and congratulate \r\nhim on his appointment as the ninth Secretary-\r\nGeneral. I am confident that the Secretary-General will \r\nbuild upon the strong foundation that was laid by his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to whom I wish to pay \r\nglowing tribute for the manner in which he steered the \r\nOrganization during his tenure of office.\r\nThe theme for this session, “Focusing on people: \r\nStriving for peace and a decent life for all on a \r\nsustainable planet”, provides us with an opportunity to \r\nevaluate the existing multilateral approaches to address \r\nthe challenges affecting our peoples. They include \r\nthreats to socioeconomic development and international \r\npeace and security. There is a need, therefore, to \r\ndevelop innovative approaches and responses to the \r\nchallenges, which include terrorism, climate change, \r\nnuclear weapons and HIV/AIDS, among many others. \r\nIn today’s globalized and interdependent world, no \r\ncountry, however wealthy or powerful, can resolve all \r\nthose challenges single-handedly. Common solutions \r\nare therefore required through a strong United Nations.\r\nThis year’s session is taking place against a backdrop \r\nof the adverse effects of climate change, which have \r\nspared no one nation, developed or underdeveloped. \r\nOur efforts to raise the standard of living for the \r\nworld’s poor people in order to meet the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals are being frustrated by the effects \r\nof climate change. We have witnessed the devastating \r\neffects of climate change on our environment. Recently, \r\nthere have been many hurricanes in the Caribbean. I \r\nremember a time when forests were within a child’s \r\nwalking distance, in particular in Africa, and were \r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 15/28\r\nteeming with a profusion of f lora and fauna. That is \r\nno longer the case. Unfortunately, a myriad of species \r\nof f lora and fauna have become extinct in a very short \r\ntime. We have also continued to witness disasters such \r\nas droughts, wildfires, f looding and landslides; if not \r\nextreme levels of rain, it is the lack of it.\r\nAs the twenty-third Conference of the Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change draws near, Zambia is expectant that \r\nthe Conference will, among other things, establish \r\nmechanisms for the implementation of the Paris \r\nAgreement on climate change. Furthermore, we call on \r\nall stakeholders to ensure that the Green Climate Fund is \r\nadequately funded in order to help deliver the necessary \r\ninterventions globally. As a developing country, Zambia \r\nneeds assistance to enhance its capacity in key adaptive \r\nareas, such as scientific research, early warning and \r\nrapid response in order to address the adverse effects of \r\nclimate change. Accordingly, Zambia also calls for the \r\ntransfer of appropriate technologies to help cope with \r\nthe negative impact of climate change. \r\nOver the past year, Zambia has made significant \r\ndevelopmental efforts and is determined to foster an \r\nall-inclusive development paradigm, based on the \r\nAfrican Union’s Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. Only a few months ago, on \r\n21 June, I had the honour to launch the seventh National \r\nDevelopment Plan, which is Zambia’s development \r\nblueprint for the five-year period from 2017 to 2021. \r\nIts theme is “Accelerating development efforts towards \r\nthe attainment of the National Vision 2030, without \r\nleaving anyone behind”. The plan seeks to improve \r\nproductivity in agriculture, create job opportunities in \r\nother sectors, such as manufacturing, and particular \r\nattention will be given to lifting standards of living in \r\nrural areas, where a new focus on agro-value addition \r\nis being implemented. Through that plan, Zambia aims \r\nto reduce poverty to minimal levels.\r\nIn keeping with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda \r\non financing for development, my Government is \r\ndetermined to ensure the effective mobilization and use \r\nof all sources of finance, whether mobilized locally or \r\nthrough our international cooperation partners, for the \r\nbenefit of the average person in Zambia — as long as it \r\nis not illicit financing.\r\nPeace, security and the rule of law continue to \r\nbe the basis for the meaningful development of any \r\nsociety. In keeping with that understanding, my \r\nGovernment has continued to work in solidarity with \r\nnations that are undertaking the necessary actions to \r\nenhance their democracies. Through its membership \r\nin the African Union Peace and Security Council, \r\nZambia has also continued to provide support for those \r\nstill aff licted by conflict. My Government also looks \r\nforward to serving the Troika of the Organ on Politics, \r\nDefence and Security Cooperation of the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community from 2017 to 2020, \r\nfollowing our recent election to the Organ. I would \r\nlike to assure the Assembly that my Government will \r\nuse its membership in these two bodies to foster peace \r\nglobally, especially in Africa.\r\nWe wish to recognize the vision and experience \r\nof the various regional and international bodies that \r\ncomplement the United Nations agenda. As a member \r\nState, we note the role of the Commonwealth of Nations \r\nin various subjects such as gender and youth matters, \r\nclimate change, the promotion of democracy, the rule of \r\nlaw, human rights, good governance and socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment. In my country, the Commonwealth \r\nSecretariat has played an important role in providing \r\ntechnical support during and after the previously held \r\nelections, and this we cannot ignore.\r\nZambia has also continued to serve in United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations with a sense of \r\nduty to those persons who have found their security \r\nunder threat for various reasons. In this regard, the \r\nUnited Nations should not shirk its noble duty to these \r\nvulnerable persons; it should redouble its efforts to \r\nbring about a more peaceful world.\r\nThe United Nations commitment should not be \r\nlimited to preventing conflict, but should go further \r\nin seeking to protect victims of conflict, including \r\ndisplaced persons. There is a need for all of us to \r\ncooperate in providing for a environment conducive \r\nto respect for their human rights, social development \r\nand well-being. In this regard, I am pleased to inform \r\nthe General Assembly that in June this year, in Zambia, \r\nI assented to Zambia’s Refugees Act of 2017, which \r\nfurther speaks to this noble duty and replaces the \r\nprevious law, which did not go far enough to ensure \r\nan environment conducive to the promotion of human \r\nrights for the displaced in the region who happen to be \r\nhosted by our country, Zambia.\r\nMy Government attaches great importance to \r\nthe needs and welfare of all, with a particular focus \r\non women, children and youth. Zambia has therefore \r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n16/28 17-29122\r\ncontinued to make tremendous strides in its campaign \r\nto end child marriage. The current prevalence rate \r\nstands at 31.2 per cent, which represents a 10.8 per \r\ncent reduction from the 42 per cent rate at the time the \r\ncampaign was launched. We have also continued to \r\nengage traditional leaders in reforming traditions and \r\ncustoms that allow child marriage. Currently, we are \r\nin the process of harmonizing statutory and customary \r\nlaw on marriage to completely prohibit and eradicate \r\nchild marriage in the country. Going forward, we are \r\nalso repealing a number of discriminatory and outdated \r\nstatutes related to children with a view to devising \r\na Children’s Code to incorporate the provisions of \r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child into our \r\ndomestic law.\r\nAs the designated 2017 African Union champion \r\nfor ending child marriage, I am delighted to inform \r\nthe Assembly that a campaign to that end has been \r\nlaunched in 20 of the 30 targeted countries in Africa \r\nwith the highest prevalence rates of child marriage. \r\nThese programmes are essential to enhancing \r\nadvocacy against child marriage at the national level. \r\nThe campaign is growing from strength to strength. \r\nHowever, much more needs to be done. We therefore \r\ncall on all partners to join their efforts, and, together, \r\nlet us raise our voices to protect our children and young \r\npeople. The campaign will continue to gain momentum \r\nand reach out to member States to accelerate an end to \r\nthis harmful practice.\r\nUndoubtedly, the United Nations remains the \r\nonly multilateral institution capable of addressing \r\nthe challenges of our “one world”. The world looks \r\nto the Organization to encourage dialogue on global \r\nchallenges in an inclusive manner. This is the only \r\npractical way to ensure meaningful and effective \r\ninternational cooperation. There is, however, a need to \r\nreform the United Nations.\r\nZambia believes that the United Nations reforms \r\nthat have been launched will be incomplete without \r\nmeaningful reform of the Security Council. It is our \r\nhope that reforms will make the Security Council more \r\nrepresentative, democratic and accountable to all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, irrespective of status. \r\nThis is essential if its decisions are to be accepted by \r\nthe entire international community. Given that Africa \r\nconstitutes the second largest bloc of United Nations \r\nmembership, proposals to reform the Security Council \r\nshould heed the African continent’s call set forth in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Zambia’s \r\ncommitment to cooperate with the international \r\ncommunity in addressing the numerous problems \r\naffecting our people, including ending poverty. We \r\nshould not miss the opportunity to do what we can to \r\nmake the world a better place for all of us to live.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Zambia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of \r\nthe Republic of Lithuania\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania.\r\nMrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Mrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Lithuania, and to invite her \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Grybauskaitė: The topic of this \r\nyear’s debate invites us to focus on people and our \r\nresponsibility to ensure their peaceful and sustainable \r\nfuture. However, in today’s world, such a peaceful \r\nfuture is threatened as never before. Authoritarian \r\nregimes continue to kill with impunity, extremist \r\nideologies treat innocent people with unspeakable \r\ncruelty, and thousands die after leaving their homes in \r\nsearch for a better and more peaceful life.\r\nThe world’s attention is now focused on North \r\nKorea and in some other regions, but the same kinds \r\nof blackmail, bullying and aggression that we see there \r\nare also being used by Russia in Ukraine and along \r\nNATO’s eastern border. As we speak, approximately \r\n100,000 Russian troops are engaged in Exercise Zapad \r\n2017 — offensive military exercises on the borders \r\nof Baltic States, Poland and even in the Arctic. The \r\nKremlin is rehearsing aggressive scenarios against its \r\nneighbours, training its army to attack the West. The \r\nexercise is also part of information warfare that aims to \r\nspread uncertainty and fear. It is even more disturbing \r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 17/28\r\nthat the Zapad 2017 exercise is just one symptom of \r\nthe Kremlin’s inability to finally end its hatred towards \r\nthe West.\r\nDespite Russia’s special responsibility as a \r\npermanent member of the Security Council to \r\nprotect international peace, it violated the Charter \r\nof the United Nations by attacking Georgia, illegally \r\nannexing Crimea and directly participating in the war \r\nin the east of Ukraine. The Kremlin’s arsenal does \r\nnot stop at conventional weapons. Russia continues to \r\nmeddle in elections and conduct cyberattacks, and it \r\nuses its sputniks to spread fake news and destabilizing \r\npropaganda. Energy blackmail has long been Russia’s \r\nweapon of choice. For example, in Belarus, just \r\n40 kilometres from Lithuania’s capital, it is building the \r\nunsafe Astravyets nuclear power plant as a geopolitical \r\nweapon that fails to comply with basic international \r\nnuclear standards.\r\nAbuses and indifference to basic international \r\nnorms by regimes across the world are not unrelated. \r\nToo often they are a result of our collective failure to \r\ncondemn or properly react to violations. Time and time \r\nagain we lack the courage to enforce the rules that we \r\nourselves have established. We draw red lines in the \r\nsand and then pretend they do not exist. That has to \r\nchange. Bullies are aggressive precisely because they \r\nare weak and insecure, which is why we must stop being \r\npassive observers and start calling things by their real \r\nnames. Aggression can never make anyone stronger. \r\nIt can never earn anyone a single drop of respect. The \r\nonly thing that aggression will bring about is contempt, \r\nshame and condemnation.\r\nThe international community has to take a share \r\nof responsibility. We cannot let fear win by closing our \r\neyes to violators, because that will only encourage them \r\nto go further. We must learn to read the warning signs, \r\nbecause abuse of human rights, nationalist rhetoric and \r\nthe suppression of free speech explode into violence \r\nif ignored.\r\nFinally, we must change the United Nations. This \r\nunique universal body was created to save the world \r\nfrom wars and instability. So far it has failed to fulfil \r\nthat purpose. We now face a choice — we either give \r\nthe Organization the voice to rise up against the abuse, \r\nor we render it irrelevant.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania for the statement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin \r\nHamad Al-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Amir of the State of Qatar.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, \r\nAmir of the State of Qatar, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad \r\nAl-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nSheikh Al-Thani (spoke in Arabic): It gives me great \r\npleasure to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák on assuming the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session. We wish him \r\nevery success in his mandate. I also wish to express \r\nmy appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson \r\nfor his valuable efforts in managing the affairs of the \r\nGeneral Assembly during the seventy-first session. I \r\nalso take this opportunity to commend the efforts of \r\nHis Excellency Secretary-General António Guterres to \r\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations.\r\nMaintaining regional and international peace and \r\nsecurity is a priority in the foreign policy of the State \r\nof Qatar, which bases its principles and objectives \r\non the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of \r\ninternational law. It calls for constructive cooperation \r\namong States, mutual respect and non-interference in \r\ninternal affairs, as well as good-neighbourliness and \r\nthe promotion of peaceful coexistence, while pursuing \r\npeaceful means to settle disputes.\r\nThe issue of settling disputes by peaceful means \r\nis still being addressed as an episodic and non-binding \r\nproposal. Perhaps the time has come to impose dialogue \r\nand negotiation as a basis for resolving disputes by \r\nconcluding an international convention on settling \r\ndisputes between States by peaceful means.\r\nIn that context, and after major events such as the \r\nSecond World War, Rwanda and Burundi and the Balkan \r\nconflicts in the past century, the danger of the impunity \r\nof perpetrators of crimes against humanity and crimes \r\nof genocide has returned to threaten humankind by \r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n18/28 17-29122\r\nbecoming the rule rather than the exception, because \r\ninternational legitimacy is subjected to political \r\npressure, the interests of parties and the dictation of \r\nforce on the ground, which maintain that the law of \r\nforce is able to supersede the force of law.\r\nIn our view, major Powers should not range between \r\ntwo extremes: the direct occupation of countries to \r\nimpose the occupier’s will and policy, or standing idly \r\nby as an observer who does nothing with regard to wars \r\nof genocide and crimes against humanity perpetrated \r\nby fascist, despotic regimes, or to continuous repression \r\nby an occupying State of the people under occupation.\r\nLately there has been a growing sense that \r\npeople under repression face their fate alone, as if \r\nthe international arena were governed by the law of \r\nthe jungle and the countries under threat had to stand \r\non their own through help from their alliances and \r\nrelations, in the absence of a system to implement the \r\nprovisions of international law and binding conventions \r\nand charters.\r\nWe commend the President for the theme chosen \r\nfor this session, that is, “Focusing on people: Striving \r\nfor peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable \r\nplanet”. In that context, I call upon the Government \r\nof the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and the \r\ninternational community to assume their legal and \r\nmoral responsibility and take the measures necessary \r\nto stop the violence against the Rohingya minority, \r\nprovide them with protection, repatriate the displaced \r\nto their homeland, prevent sectarian or ethnic \r\ndiscrimination against them and ensure that they have \r\ntheir full legitimate rights as full-f ledged citizens. We \r\nurge all States to provide humanitarian assistance to \r\nthe Rohingya.\r\nEvery time I stand here, I speak in favour of \r\nconstructive international cooperation, just peace and \r\nthe rights of peoples under occupation, those who are \r\nsubjected to crimes against humanity and those who are \r\nunder siege. This time I stand here while my country \r\nand my people are subjected to a continuing and unjust \r\nblockade, imposed since 5 June by our neighbouring \r\ncountries. The blockade involves all aspects of life, \r\nincluding intervention by those countries to sever family \r\nties. At the moment Qatar is successfully managing its \r\nlife — its economy, development plans and its outreach \r\nto the wider world — thanks to sea and air routes that \r\nthose countries do not control.\r\nThe blockade was imposed abruptly and without \r\nwarning, prompting Qataris to consider it as a kind \r\nof betrayal. It seems that those who planned and \r\nimplemented it had envisaged that their action would \r\ncause a shocking and direct impact that would bring the \r\nState of Qatar to its knees and cause it to capitulate to a \r\ntotal guardianship imposed upon it.\r\nWhat is worse, those who schemed for the blockade \r\nfound it necessary to rely on fabricated quotes \r\nattributed to me, which they posted on the Qatar News \r\nAgency website after hacking it. The controlled media \r\nof those countries were ready to launch an all-out \r\ncampaign of incitement, prepared in advance, in which \r\nall values, morals and norms were breached, while a \r\ntorrent of lies infringed upon the truth. Funds are still \r\nbeing spent unsparingly on the machine faking news \r\nand disseminating fabrications in the hope of fooling \r\npeople by distorting the truth with plain lies.\r\nDespite the exposure of the hacking and falsification \r\nof quotes by the Amir of a sovereign State, the blockading \r\ncountries did not back down or apologize for lying, \r\nbut rather intensified their campaign, in the hope that \r\nthe blockade would cause a cumulative effect on the \r\neconomy and the society of my country, after it failed to \r\nhave any direct impact. The perpetrators of the hacking \r\nand the falsified quotes have committed an assault \r\nagainst a sovereign State. The crime was deliberately \r\ncommitted for political aims and was followed by a list \r\nof political declarations, which contravene sovereignty. \r\nThey caused worldwide astonishment.\r\nThis disgraceful act has once again raised \r\ninternational questions about digital security, \r\ncybercrime and electronic piracy. It has also revealed \r\nthe anxiety in many public and official circles around \r\nthe world over the absence of clear-cut international \r\nlegislation and institutions to govern this dangerous and \r\nvital field, or to punish the perpetrators of transnational \r\ncrimes. It is high time to take steps in this regard. We \r\nare ready to mobilize our potential to serve in such a \r\njoint effort.\r\nThe countries that imposed the unjust blockade \r\non Qatar have intervened in the internal affairs of the \r\nState by putting pressure on the citizens through food, \r\nmedicine and family ties, with a view to forcing them \r\nto change their political affiliation so as to destabilize \r\na sovereign country. Is this not one of the definitions \r\nof terrorism?\r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 19/28\r\nThis illegal blockade was not confined to the \r\neconomic field and to breaching the World Trade \r\nOrganization agreement, but went beyond that to \r\nviolate human rights conventions by arbitrary measures \r\nthat have caused social and religious harm to thousands \r\nof citizens and residents of the countries of the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council by violating the basic human \r\nrights to work, education and the freedom of movement \r\nand the right to private property.\r\nHowever, things did not stop at that point, as the \r\nblockading countries went on to persecute their own \r\ncitizens on their own territories and to impose penalties \r\nof imprisonment and fines on them for the mere \r\nexpression of their sympathy with the State of Qatar, \r\neven on social media. That was unprecedented, and it \r\nviolates the human rights conventions and agreements \r\nthat guarantee the right to the freedom of opinion \r\nand expression.\r\nThere are countries that not only attack a \r\nneighbouring country so as to dictate its foreign policy \r\nand media policy, but also believe that having a lot of \r\nmoney qualifies them to put pressure on other countries \r\nand blackmail them to participate in their aggression, \r\nwhile they are supposed to be held accountable \r\ninternationally for what they have committed.\r\nThe countries that imposed the blockade on the \r\nState of Qatar are interfering in the internal affairs \r\nof many countries and accuse all those who oppose \r\nthem, domestically or abroad, of terrorism. Thus they \r\nare harming the war on terror, while at the same time \r\nopposing reform and supporting the tyrannical regimes \r\nin our region, in whose prisons terrorists are born.\r\nWe were not alone in being taken by surprise by the \r\nimposition of the blockade, as many countries whose \r\nleaders have questioned its motives and reasons were \r\nalso surprised. The blockading countries have promised \r\nall those who asked them about the reasons for the \r\nblockade to provide them with evidence of their absurd \r\nanti-Qatar allegations and fabrications, which keep \r\nchanging according to the identity of the person being \r\nasked. Everyone is still waiting for evidence, which \r\nhas not arrived and will not arrive — because it does \r\nnot exist. On the contrary, those allegations contradict \r\nthe considerable evidence about Qatar’s contribution to \r\nthe fight against terrorism, which is recognized by the \r\nentire international community.\r\nThe State of Qatar has fought terrorism, and the \r\nentire international community bears witness to that. \r\nIt is still fighting terrorism and will continue to do \r\nso. It stands in the camp of those who are fighting by \r\nsecurity means and believes that it is necessary to fight \r\nterrorism ideologically as well. Qatar goes beyond that \r\nto participate in drying up its sources by providing \r\neducation to 7 million children around the world, so \r\nthat they do not fall prey to ignorance and radical ideas.\r\nWe have refused to yield to dictation by pressure \r\nand blockade, and our people will not be satisfied with \r\nanything less. At the same time, we have taken an \r\nopen attitude towards dialogue without dictation and \r\nhave expressed our readiness to resolve differences \r\nthrough compromises based on common undertakings. \r\nResolving conflicts by peaceful means is one of the \r\npriorities of our foreign policy. I renew here the call for \r\nan unconditional dialogue based on mutual respect for \r\nsovereignty. I highly value the sincere and appreciated \r\nmediation that the State of Qatar has supported since \r\nthe beginning of the crisis, which was initiated by \r\nmy brother, His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad \r\nAl-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the sisterly State of Kuwait. \r\nI also thank all the countries that have supported \r\nthis mediation.\r\nAllow me on this occasion to express here my \r\npride in my Qatari people, along with the multinational \r\nand multicultural residents of Qatar. The people have \r\nwithstood the conditions of siege, rejected dictation \r\nwith resolve and pride, insisted on the independence \r\nof Qatar’s sovereign decision and strengthened its \r\nunity and solidarity, while maintaining their refined \r\nmanners and their progress despite the fierceness of the \r\ncampaign launched against them and their country.\r\nI reiterate my thanks to the sisterly and friendly \r\ncountries that recognize the significance of respecting \r\nthe sovereignty of States and the rule of international \r\nlaw, while also appreciating their stance of remaining \r\nsupportive of the Qatari people during this crisis.\r\nTerrorism and extremism are among the most \r\nserious challenges facing the world. Countering them \r\nrequires us all to carry out concerted action against \r\nterrorist organizations and their extremist ideology, in \r\norder to maintain security for humankind and stability \r\nfor the world. Governments worldwide have no choice \r\nbut to cooperate in dealing with the threat of terrorism \r\nas a security issue, but halting the spread of terrorism \r\nand extremism can be achieved by addressing its \r\nsocial, political and cultural root causes. We must also \r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n20/28 17-29122\r\nbe careful not to use the fight against terrorism as an \r\numbrella to cover reprisals or the shelling of civilians.\r\nThe fight against terrorism and extremism was \r\nand will continue to be a top priority. That is affirmed \r\nby the effective participation of the State of Qatar \r\nin regional and international efforts to implement \r\nthe measures included in the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy, adopted in 2006, and all \r\nthe Security Council resolutions and measures related \r\nto countering terrorism and its financing.\r\nWe have also participated in international coalitions \r\nand regional organizations and nurtured bilateral \r\nrelations with the United States of America and many \r\ncountries of the world. The State of Qatar will continue \r\nits regional and international efforts in this regard and \r\nwill develop them further.\r\nWhile reaffirming our condemnation of all forms \r\nof extremism and terrorism, we reject the tackling of \r\nthis phenomenon using double standards, according to \r\nthe identity of the perpetrators, or linking terrorism \r\nwith a particular religion, race, civilization, culture \r\nor society.\r\nThe issues facing the Middle East continue to pose \r\nthe greatest threat to international peace and security \r\ndue to the vital importance of that region to the world. \r\nIsrael still stands in the way of achieving a lasting, \r\njust and comprehensive peace and rejects the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative. The Israeli Government maintains its \r\nintransigent approach and strategy to create facts on \r\nthe ground through expanding settlement construction \r\nin the occupied territories, Judaizing Jerusalem and \r\nrestricting the performance of religious rituals in the \r\nAl-Aqsa Mosque, which is a serious, provocative act. It \r\nalso continues to impose its blockade on the Gaza Strip.\r\nThe international community must give high priority \r\nto the resumption of peace negotiations on the basis of \r\nending the Israeli occupation of the Arab territories \r\nwithin a specified time frame, and to reaching a just, \r\ncomprehensive and vital settlement, in accordance with \r\nthe two-State solution, agreed upon by the international \r\ncommunity and based on the resolutions of international \r\nlegitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative. A settlement \r\nwill be achieved only through the establishment of an \r\nindependent Palestinian State on the basis of the 1967 \r\nborders, with Jerusalem as its capital. I renew my \r\nappeal to my Palestinian brothers to achieve national \r\nreconciliation, consolidate their positions and speak \r\nwith one voice when confronting the dangers and \r\nchallenges facing the Palestinian question on the future \r\nof the Palestinian people.\r\nThe international community is unable to find a \r\nsolution to the Syrian crisis despite its consequences \r\nand serious repercussions for the region and the world. \r\nPolitical efforts continue to falter due to conflicting \r\ninternational and regional interests, which serve to \r\nprotect those against whom we are supposed to stand \r\nunited. The international community has relinquished \r\nits legal and moral responsibilities, including the \r\nimplementation of its decisions, and has succumbed \r\nto the logic of force. What is required is serious work \r\nto reach a political solution to the Syrian crisis in a \r\nway that meets the aspirations of the Syrian people \r\nto justice, dignity and freedom, and to maintain the \r\nunity and sovereignty of Syria, in accordance with the \r\ndecisions of the Geneva I Conference on Syria. Qatar \r\nwill spare no effort in providing support and assistance \r\nto alleviate the humanitarian suffering of our Syrian \r\nbrothers and to implement our humanitarian pledges \r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations.\r\nThe international community has given up the task \r\nof protecting civilians. Will it also hesitate to find war \r\ncriminals accountable? Their impunity will have dire \r\nconsequences for the situation in Syria and the region, \r\nand would affect the behaviour of future dictatorships \r\ntowards their peoples in the absence of any deterrent.\r\nTurning to the Libyan question, Libya’s national \r\nconsensus, which would preserve its unity, sovereignty \r\nand social fabric and restore its stability, could \r\nbe achieved by means of combining domestic and \r\ninternational efforts. We must all intensify our efforts \r\nand support the Government of National Accord, which \r\nhas been established with the support of the United \r\nNations, in its effort to restore stability and to counter \r\nterrorism and its grave consequences. The State of \r\nQatar has supported international mediation efforts \r\nand will support them in future in order to meet the \r\naspirations of the Libyan people.\r\nConcerning the fraternal country of Iraq, we \r\nsupport the efforts of the Iraqi Government to achieve \r\nsecurity, stability and the unity of the territory and \r\npeople of Iraq. We commend the achievements of the \r\nIraqi people in their fight against terrorism. We reaffirm \r\nour support to promote their victory by helping the \r\npeople of Iraq to realize their aspirations for equality \r\namong all its citizens and to restore Iraq’s role at the \r\nregional and international levels.\r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 21/28\r\nConcerning Yemen, we affirm the importance of \r\nmaintaining Yemen’s unity, security and stability and \r\nending the state of infighting and war, while adopting \r\ndialogue, a political solution and national reconciliation \r\nas a basis for ending this crisis and implementing \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2216 (2015). We call on \r\nthe international community to facilitate the access \r\nof humanitarian assistance to various Yemeni regions. \r\nThe State of Qatar supports the efforts of the United \r\nNations Special Envoy for Yemen to end the crisis and \r\nrealize the aspirations of the brotherly Yemeni people \r\nto attain unity, security and stability.\r\nIn order to achieve security and stability in the \r\nGulf region, we reiterate the call that we have made \r\nbefore from this rostrum for a constructive dialogue \r\nbetween the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and \r\nIran on the basis of common interests, the principle of \r\ngood-neighbourliness, respect for State sovereignty and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\r\nIn the framework of international efforts to address \r\nhumanitarian crises, the State of Qatar continues to \r\ncontribute to the international response to the growing \r\nhumanitarian needs of the world at large. We have \r\nincreased our financial contributions to the United \r\nNations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs (OCHA) so as to enable the Organization to \r\nimplement its programmes and provide humanitarian \r\nrelief to those in need worldwide.\r\nThe State of Qatar ranks third on the list of major \r\ndonors to OCHA in 2017. We continue to provide \r\nsupport to countries facing challenges in implementing \r\ntheir development plans. It is worth mentioning here \r\nthat the State of Qatar ranked first in the Arab world \r\nand 33rd in the world in the field of human development. \r\nThis proves the effectiveness of our humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment policy. We look forward to achieving the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, which we all have \r\ncommitted to achieve.\r\nIn conclusion, we reiterate that the State of Qatar \r\nwill spare no effort in strengthening the role of the \r\nUnited Nations and and efforts to achieve what the \r\ninternational community seeks, bringing peace and \r\nsecurity and promoting human rights and advancing \r\ndevelopment. Qatar will remain, as is always the case, \r\na safe haven for the oppressed, and we will continue its \r\nmediation efforts to find just solutions in conflict zones.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Amir of the State of \r\nQatar for the statement he has just made.\r\nSheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President \r\nof the Republic of Turkey\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Turkey.\r\nMr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Turkey, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Erdoğan (spoke in Turkish; interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): I greet the General \r\nAssembly with respect on behalf of myself and \r\nmy country.\r\nI would like to thank Mr. Peter Thomson for his \r\nsuccessful work over the past year as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session. I would \r\nalso like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, who has \r\nassumed the presidency of the General Assembly.\r\nI hope that this year’s session of the General \r\nAssembly, which has been convened under the theme \r\n“Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent \r\nlife for all on a sustainable planet”, will bring well-\r\nbeing to all of the world’s peoples.\r\nUnfortunately, global peace and stability have \r\nregressed further since our meeting in the Hall last \r\nyear. We continue to see the ugly face of terror and war \r\nin different corners of the world. Terrorists, who are \r\nfuelled by an environment of conflict, continue their \r\nacts, spreading terror across different regions. We \r\nare anxiously observing the violent actions of radical \r\ncurrents converging on xenophobia, cultural racism \r\nand animosity against Islam.\r\nThe most effective way of reversing this negative \r\noutlook would be to engage in sincere cooperation \r\nin the Hall. We need to develop a new perspective to \r\npromote world peace. No crisis or threat can possibly \r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n22/28 17-29122\r\nbe resolved by allowing it to play out on its own. We \r\nall have to shoulder responsibility for a safer and \r\nmore prosperous world. It is in that understanding that \r\nTurkey is pursuing an enterprising and humanitarian \r\nforeign policy.\r\nThe Syrian conflict has entered its seventh year. \r\nThis conflict has created deep wounds in the country, \r\nthe region and throughout the world. In Syria, an entire \r\ncivilization is being annihilated, together with civilians \r\nand innocent children. Terrorism, which is destroying \r\nthe country and is fuelled by instability and oppression, \r\nis spreading like a cancer across borders. The Syrian \r\npeople who took action demanding democracy, \r\nfreedom, justice and a bright future were, unfortunately, \r\nabandoned by the international community.\r\nTurkey cannot remain indifferent to the tragedy of \r\nthese people, whom we see as our brothers and sisters \r\nregardless of their origin or creed and to whom we are \r\nconnected by deep historical ties. Since the outbreak \r\nof the conflict in Syria in the spring of 2011, we have \r\nexerted all kinds of humanitarian and political efforts \r\nto solve the problem and we will continue to do so. \r\nWe are currently hosting more than 3 million Syrians \r\nand over 200,000 Iraqis in our country. Together with \r\nRussia and Iran, we have launched the Astana meetings, \r\nwith the participation of all parties to the conflict, in \r\norder to establish a permanent ceasefire and peace in \r\nthe country.\r\nFollowing our initiatives, the Geneva process, \r\nwhich has long been blocked, has been revived. We are \r\nputting into practice a new plan to ensure the security \r\nof the Idlib region in Syria within the framework of the \r\nagreement reached in Astana. Turkey would support \r\nany step towards the construction of a stable and \r\nprosperous Syria, based on the territorial integrity of \r\nthe country and on respect for the democratic demands \r\nof its people.\r\nWe have taken and will continue to take all kinds \r\nof measures for those who came to our country with the \r\noutbreak of the Syrian crisis and to stem the influx of \r\nrefugees into Europe. We meet all the needs of these \r\npeople, from shelter to food and clothing and from health \r\ncare to education, at standards that are appreciated by \r\nall those who visit our country. However, I would like to \r\nunderscore that we have not received sufficient support \r\nfrom the international community, especially from the \r\nEuropean Union, for our efforts. The expenditures of \r\nour public institutions, civil-society organizations \r\nand our people in order to meet the needs of those \r\nliving in the camps and cities in Turkey have exceeded \r\n$30 billion. In response, the European Union has sent \r\nonly €820 million out of the €3 billion + €3 billion that \r\nit promised. The total assistance from the international \r\ncommunity through the United Nations remains \r\naround $520 million. I should point out that no share \r\nof the assistance intended for the Syrians goes into our \r\nown budget; it is all delivered to those in need by the \r\nrelief agencies through the relevant institutions of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nBefore the whole world, I hereby call on the \r\ncountries and international organizations that have \r\nplaced the entire burden of the 3.2 million people on \r\nTurkey’s shoulders to fulfil the promises they made. In \r\nfact, Turkey is a country that carries out humanitarian \r\naid and development assistance activities around \r\nthe world. Not only do we welcome those who come \r\nto our country, but through the Turkish Cooperation \r\nand Coordination Agency, the Turkish Disaster and \r\nManagement Authority and the Turkish Red Crescent \r\nand various civil-society organizations we rush to the \r\nhelp of all who are suffering and under oppression, \r\nregardless of which part of the world they may be in. \r\nFor example, through its official institutions and civil-\r\nsociety organizations, Turkey has spent $1 billion for \r\nthe reconstruction of Somalia so far. The work we carry \r\nout and the results we have achieved in Somalia could \r\nindeed provide an example for similar efforts.\r\nAccording to confirmed statistics of the Organization \r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development, with \r\n$6 billion in humanitarian and development aid in 2016, \r\nTurkey ranked as the world’s second-largest donor and \r\ntop contributor in terms of gross national product. \r\nYet, Turkey is the seventeenth-largest economy in the \r\nworld. Having spent 0.8 per cent of its national income \r\non humanitarian assistance, Turkey is one of the six \r\ncountries that could meet the United Nations target.\r\nTherefore, Turkey is working diligently to achieve a \r\nsustainable world, which is the theme of this session of \r\nthe General Assembly. We will continue in the coming \r\ndays with the same consideration in mind.\r\nTurkey is engaged in an intense fight against the \r\nbloody terrorist organizations of the region, such \r\nas Da’esh and the Kurdish Workers’ Party, which \r\nare nourished by the instability in Syria and Iraq. In \r\naddition, our fight against the Fethullah Terrorist \r\nOrganization, which attempted to change the legitimate \r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 23/28\r\nand democratic regime of Turkey by a bloody coup, is \r\nalso ongoing. We have recovered 243 residential areas \r\nand a tract of land larger than 2,000 kilometres thanks to \r\nOperation Euphrates Shield, initiated in Syria following \r\nthe attacks by Da’esh on our borders. We neutralized \r\nalmost 3,000 Da’esh militants during that operation. \r\nAround 100,000 Syrians returned to and resettled in \r\nthe region we cleared of terrorists. Operation Euphrates \r\nShield is the single greatest accomplishment against \r\nDa’esh since its occupation of the region.\r\nI must highlight the following fact before \r\nthe Assembly. Most of the groups and forces claiming \r\nto be fighting Da’esh in the region in fact have no such \r\ngoal. These groups and forces are using Da’esh as a \r\npretext to realize their own agendas.\r\nThe efforts of the Partiya Yekitiya Demokrat-\r\nPeople’s Protection Units to change the demographic \r\nstructure of the regions it has captured, to seize the \r\nproperty of the people and to kill or exile those who \r\nstand against it constitute a crime against humanity.\r\nIf the fight against Da’esh is not waged on a \r\nlegitimate basis, the world will certainly face the threat \r\nof new, Da’esh-like entities.\r\nSimilar approaches exist in Iraq as well. Iraq also \r\nrequires that compromises be reached on the basis of \r\nterritorial integrity and the realization of the ideal of \r\nbuilding a common future. Steps such as demands \r\nfor independence that can cause fresh crises and \r\nconflicts in the region must be avoided. We hereby call \r\non the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government to abort \r\nthe initiative that it has launched in that direction. \r\nIgnoring the clear and determined stance of Turkey on \r\nthis issue could lead to a process that would deprive \r\nthe Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government of even the \r\nopportunities they currently enjoy. We all should work \r\non building tranquillity, peace, security and stability in \r\nthe region instead of sparking new conflicts.\r\nIn addition to Syria and Iraq, we are also closely \r\nfollowing regions in Libya and in Yemen where terrorist \r\norganizations are trying to establish their influence. The \r\ninternational community’s support for the legitimate \r\nGovernment of Libya will contribute significantly to \r\nthe stability of the country. It should be kept in mind \r\nthat if the mistakes made in Syria and Iraq were to be \r\nrepeated in Libya, that would expose the entire world, \r\nparticularly Europe, to much greater threats.\r\nAnother issue on which Turkey places special \r\nemphasis is the immediate resolution of the conflict \r\nthat has erupted in the Gulf region. We believe that \r\nthe sanctions that are negatively affecting the living \r\nconditions of the Qatari people should be lifted \r\nforthwith. We support the mediation efforts of the Amir \r\nof Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, \r\nto resolve the crisis. Our hope is that these efforts will \r\nyield positive results. We also hope that Saudi Arabia, \r\nwhich we see as the elder brother of the Gulf region, \r\nwill show a sincere will to resolve this issue.\r\nAnother important problem is the issue of Palestine, \r\nwhich we consider to be the gaping wound of the world, \r\nand, by extension, the preservation of the historical \r\nstatus of Jerusalem and Al-Haram Al-Sharif, that is, \r\nthe Temple Mount. The crisis in Al-Haram Al-Sharif \r\nin July demonstrated the sensitivity of the issue. The \r\ncontinuation of the peace process can be possible only \r\non the condition that Israel immediately stop its illegal \r\nsettlement activities and take steps towards a two-\r\nState solution.\r\nIn this context, I call on the international \r\ncommunity to support our Palestinian brothers and \r\nsisters in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in \r\ntheir struggle for an independent and geographically \r\nunified Palestinian State.\r\nDespite the current absence of conflict there, the \r\nBalkans is another geographical location of potential \r\ncrisis that still faces serious challenges. For this reason, \r\nwe attach great importance to the integration of the \r\nBalkan countries into the Euro-Atlantic institutions. \r\nTurkey will continue to do its part to ensure that peace, \r\nstability and well-being prevail in this exceptional part \r\nof the world.\r\nThe territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and \r\nGeorgia is the key to regional stability in the southern \r\nCaucasus. Therefore, we need to work harder towards \r\nthe resolution of the conflicts in Nagorno Karabakh, \r\nAbkhazia and South Ossetia.\r\nWe should never forget that each crisis we ignore \r\ntoday has the potential to spark a regional or even \r\nglobal crisis tomorrow. In this context, I would also \r\nlike to underline that we are against nuclear weapons of \r\nall kinds, which have increasingly come to occupy the \r\nworld agenda in recent days. It is clear that we cannot \r\novercome these problems unless we completely free the \r\nworld of the scourge of nuclear weapons.\r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n24/28 17-29122\r\nWe are also saddened by the fact that the \r\ncomprehensive negotiation process begun in 2008 \r\nhas ended owing to the incomprehensible stance of \r\nthe Greek Cypriots. We will do our best to ensure \r\nthat the natural resources discovered in the eastern \r\nMediterranean in recent years serve to further the \r\npeace, stability and welfare of the region. We are ready \r\nto consider proposals for a solution that respects the \r\nrights of Turkish Cypriots.\r\nOur world, already struggling with all of these \r\nglobal and regional problems, was shocked once again \r\nby the sad news that we received from Myanmar a few \r\nweeks ago. The Muslim community in the Rakhine \r\nregion of Myanmar is being subjected to what almost \r\namounts to ethnic cleansing, with provocative terrorist \r\nacts used as a pretext. The villages of the Rohingya \r\nMuslims, who have already been living in extreme \r\npoverty and misery, deprived of their citizenship rights, \r\nare being burned as hundreds of thousands of people \r\nare forced to migrate from the region and the country.\r\nThe camps in Bangladesh to which the people \r\nmigrating from the region are being diverted are not in \r\na position to meet even their minimum humanitarian \r\nneeds. As is the case in Syria, the international \r\ncommunity has not given a good account of itself \r\nregarding the humanitarian plight of the Rohingya \r\nMuslims. If the tragedy in Myanmar is not stopped, the \r\nhistory of humankind will be marred by yet another \r\ndark stain. What is most important is to ensure that the \r\nRohingya people who have taken refuge outside their \r\ncountry, especially in Bangladesh, are able to live in \r\nsafety and peace and in conditions of well-being on their \r\nown lands, where they have lived for centuries. Turkey \r\nis endeavouring to help resolve this crisis as well.\r\nRecently, on the occasion of a meeting of the \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), we held \r\na special session on that issue in Astana, the capital \r\nof Kazakhstan, with the participating countries. My \r\nwife, my son and our Ministers who visited the camps \r\nin Bangladesh immediately after the latest crisis \r\npersonally witnessed the humanitarian plight of the \r\npeople there. Clothing, food and other humanitarian \r\naid was provided, and we are now looking at the second \r\nphase of such aid. We will be holding a meeting of \r\nthe OIC Contact Group on Rohingya Muslims here \r\nat the United Nations this afternoon. As I mentioned, \r\nmy wife, my son, our Ministers and some Turkish \r\nnon-governmental organizations visited the area. The \r\nTurkish International Cooperation and Coordination \r\nAgency, the Turkish official aid organization, is also \r\nin the region; it is the only organization carrying out \r\nassistance activities.\r\nFurthermore, the Turkish Red Crescent and other \r\nnon-governmental organizations are continuing to \r\ndeliver humanitarian aid to the Rakhine Muslims \r\nin Myanmar. If the countries concerned provide the \r\nnecessary means, we would like to continue our \r\nassistance activities in a more comprehensive way. I \r\ndiscussed these issues with the Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations, His Excellency António Guterres, \r\nand we are now preparing to take further steps.\r\nAll these developments and humanitarian \r\ntragedies confirm the relevance of our appeal for the \r\nrestructuring of the United Nations, especially the \r\nSecurity Council, as symbolized by our motto, “The \r\nworld is bigger than five”. Gathered here under this \r\nroof, we must understand that it is high time to reform \r\nthe Security Council. Under this roof, we represent \r\nthe entire world, but if we cannot display the will to \r\nprevent murders carried out by terrorist organizations \r\nor prevent humanitarian crises, then everyone will find \r\nways to help themselves.\r\nIf that understanding prevails, then our world will \r\nbe dragged into a new maelstorm of chaos and cruelty. \r\nIf Western countries do not prevent tendencies such as \r\nxenophobia, racism and animosity against Islam, if the \r\ncountries in the crisis-ridden regions of the world do not \r\ndemonstrate decisive will to fight terrorist organizations \r\nand poverty, and if all of us do not cooperate with one \r\nanother on all of those fronts, then how can we possibly \r\nreach our ideals of peace and a decent life for all on a \r\nsustainable planet?\r\nWe support the work done to that end by the \r\nSecretary-General, with whom we cooperated \r\nclosely during his tenure as the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees. It is in nobody’s interest \r\nto insist on the continuation of this distorted system, \r\nwhich no longer has the capacity to take concrete steps \r\ntowards the good of humankind under its current form.\r\nWe want the Security Council to have a democratic, \r\ntransparent, fair and effective structure. We propose \r\nthat the Security Council consist of 20 members with the \r\nsame rights and competencies — each member serving \r\nfor two years and half replaced every year. In that way, \r\nall countries would have a say in that important organ \r\nwhen it was their turn. It is imperative that we transform \r\nthe United Nations, because the world is changing. We \r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 25/28\r\nare living in a different world than the one where the \r\nUnited Nations was established after the Second World \r\nWar. We must talk about a United Nations administered \r\nby representatives of the entire world as the embodiment \r\nof humankind’s common conscience.\r\nBefore I conclude my remarks, let me remind the \r\nAssembly that, regardless of the colour of our faces and \r\neyes, our tears are the same. I urge the Assembly take \r\naction immediately to stop the tears f lowing in different \r\nparts of the world. I hope that the work of the seventy-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly will contribute \r\nto our efforts to that end. With those thoughts, I salute \r\nwith amity and respect all countries and peoples \r\nrepresented under this roof, at this joint parliament of \r\nhumankind. On my own behalf, and on behalf of my \r\ncountry, I extend my greetings to the Assembly. God \r\nbless the Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Turkey for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nMr. Danon (Israel), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nAgenda item 8\r\nAddress by Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Israel\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the State \r\nof Israel.\r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Israel, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Netanyahu (Israel): We are in the midst of \r\na great revolution — a revolution in Israel’s standing \r\namong the nations. It is happening because so many \r\ncountries around the world have finally woken up \r\nto what Israel can do for them. Those countries now \r\nrecognize what brilliant investors like Warren Buffett \r\nand great companies like Google and Intel have \r\nrecognized and known for years, that is, that Israel \r\nis the innovation nation, the place for cutting-edge \r\ntechnology in agriculture, in water, in cybersecurity, \r\nin medicine, in autonomous vehicles. You name it, we \r\nhave got it.\r\nThose countries now also recognize Israel’s \r\nexceptional capabilities in fighting terrorism. In \r\nrecent years, Israel has provided intelligence that has \r\nprevented dozens of major terrorist attacks around \r\nthe world. We have saved countless lives. Members \r\nmay not know it, but their Governments do. And they \r\nare working closely together with Israel to keep their \r\ncountries and its citizens safe.\r\nI stood here last year, at this rostrum, and I spoke \r\nabout that profound change in Israel’s standing around \r\nthe world (see A/71/PV.14). Just look at what has \r\nhappened since. In one year, hundreds of Presidents, \r\nPrime Ministers, Foreign Ministers and other leaders \r\nhave visited Israel — many for the first time. Of those \r\nmany visits, two were truly historic. In May, President \r\nTrump became the first American President to include \r\nIsrael in his first visit abroad. President Trump stood \r\nat the Western Wall, at the foot of the Temple Mount, \r\nwhere the Jewish people’s temples stood for nearly \r\n1,000 years. When the President touched those ancient \r\nstones, he touched our hearts forever.\r\nIn July, Prime Minister Modi became the first Indian \r\nPrime Minister to visit Israel. Some here may have seen \r\nthe pictures. We were on a beach in Hadera. We rode \r\ntogether in a Jeep outfitted with a portable desalination \r\ndevice that some thriving Israeli entrepreneur invented. \r\nWe took off our shoes, waded into the Mediterranean \r\nand drank seawater that had been purified only a few \r\nminutes earlier. We imagined the endless possibilities \r\nfor Israel, for India and for all of humankind.\r\nIn the past year, Israel has hosted many world \r\nleaders. I had the honour of representing my country \r\non six different continents in one year. I went to \r\nAfrica, where I saw Israeli innovators increasing crop \r\nyields, turning air into water, fighting AIDS. I went \r\nto Asia, where we deepened our relations with China \r\nand Singapore, and expanded our cooperation with our \r\nMuslim friends in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. I went \r\nto Europe, where, in London and Paris, Thessaloniki \r\nand Budapest we enhanced our security and economic \r\nties. I went to Australia, becoming the first Israeli \r\nPrime Minister to visit our great allies down under. \r\nAnd just last week, I went to South America, visiting \r\nArgentina and Colombia, and then I went on to \r\nMexico — becoming, if members can believe it, the \r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n26/28 17-29122\r\nfirst Israeli Prime Minister to visit Latin America. \r\nAfter 70 years, the world is embracing Israel, and Israel \r\nis embracing the world.\r\nIn one year, I visited six continents. It is true that I \r\nhave not yet visited Antarctica, but I want to go there too, \r\nbecause I have heard that penguins are also enthusiastic \r\nsupporters of Israel. Members laugh. But penguins \r\nhave no difficulty recognizing that some things are \r\nblack or white, are right or wrong. Unfortunately, when \r\nit comes to United Nations decisions about Israel, that \r\nsimple recognition is too often absent. It was absent \r\nlast December, when the Security Council adopted \r\nanti-Israel resolution 2334 (2016), which set back the \r\ncause of peace.\r\nIt was absent last May, when the World Health \r\nOrganization — one has to listen to this — adopted a \r\nSyrian-sponsored draft resolution that criticized Israel \r\nfor health conditions on the Golan Heights. As the great \r\nJohn McEnroe would say, “You cannot be serious!” \r\nThat is preposterous. Syria has barrel-bombed, starved, \r\ngassed and murdered hundreds of thousands of its own \r\ncitizens, and wounded millions more, while Israel \r\nhas provided life-saving medical care to thousands of \r\nSyrian victims of that very same carnage. Yet who does \r\nthe World Health Organization criticize? Israel.\r\nIs there no limit to United Nations absurdities \r\nwhen it comes to Israel? Apparently not, because in \r\nJuly, UNESCO declared the Tomb of the Patriarchs in \r\nHebron a Palestinian World Heritage Site. That is worse \r\nthan fake news; that is fake history. While it is true \r\nthat Abraham, the father of both Ishmael and Isaac, is \r\nburied there, so are Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca and \r\nLeah — who just happen to be patriarchs and matriarchs \r\nof the Jewish people. Members will not read about that in \r\nthe latest UNESCO report. But if members want to read \r\nabout it, they can in a somewhat weightier publication. \r\nIt is called the Bible. I highly recommend it. I hear it got \r\nfour and a half out of five stars on Amazon, and it is a \r\ngreat read. I read it every week.\r\nLet me now be serious. Despite the absurdities, \r\ndespite the repetition of those farcical events, there is \r\nchange. Slowly, but surely, there are signs of positive \r\nchange — even at the United Nations. I very much \r\nappreciate the statement of the Secretary-General, \r\nindicating that denying Israel’s right to exist is \r\nanti-Semitism — pure and simple. That is important, \r\nbecause for too long the epicentre of global anti-semitism \r\nhas been right here at the United Nations. And while it \r\nmay take many years, I am absolutely confident that the \r\nrevolution of Israel’s ties with individual nations will \r\nultimately be reflected here in this Hall of nations. I \r\nsay that because there is also a marked change in the \r\nposition of some of our key friends. Thanks to President \r\nTrump’s unequivocal support for Israel in this organ, \r\nthat positive change is gathering force. I thank President \r\nTrump for supporting Israel at the United Nations, and I \r\nthank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her support. I thank \r\nthem for speaking the truth about Israel.\r\nHere at the United Nations we must also speak the \r\ntruth about Iran, as President Trump did so powerfully \r\nthis morning (see A/72/PV.3). I served as Ambassador \r\nto the United Nations and I am a long-serving Israeli \r\nPrime Minister, so I have listened to countless speeches \r\nin this Hall. But I can say this — none were bolder, \r\nnone were more courageous and forthright, than the \r\none delivered by President Trump today. President \r\nTrump rightly called the nuclear deal with Iran “an \r\nembarrassment”. I could not agree with that more. \r\nHere is why — Iran vows to destroy my country every \r\nday. That vow was repeated by its Chief of Staff the \r\nother day. Iran is conducting a campaign of conquest \r\nacross the Middle East. And Iran is developing ballistic \r\nmissiles to threaten the entire world.\r\nTwo years ago (see A/70/PV.22), I stood here and \r\nexplained why the Iranian nuclear deal not only did \r\nnot block Iran’s path to the bomb, but actually paved it. \r\nThat is because the restrictions placed on Iran’s nuclear \r\nprogramme have what is called a “sunset clause”. Let \r\nme explain what that term means. It means that in a few \r\nyears those restrictions will be automatically removed, \r\nnot by a change in Iran’s behaviour, not by a lessening \r\nof its terror or its aggression, but merely by a change \r\nin the calendar. I warned that when that sunset came, a \r\ndark shadow would be cast over the entire Middle East \r\nand the world — because Iran would then be free to \r\nenrich uranium on an industrial scale, placing it on the \r\nthreshold of a massive arsenal of nuclear weapons.\r\nThat is why I said two years ago that the greater \r\ndanger was not that Iran would rush to a single bomb by \r\nbreaking the deal, but that Iran would be able to build \r\nmany bombs by keeping the deal. In the past few months \r\nwe have all seen how dangerous even a few nuclear \r\nweapons can be in the hands of a small rogue regime. \r\nImagine the danger of hundreds of nuclear weapons in \r\nthe hands of a vast Iranian Islamist empire, with the \r\nmissiles to deliver them anywhere on Earth. I know that \r\nthere are those who still defend the dangerous deal with \r\n19/09/2017 A/72/PV.4\r\n17-29122 27/28\r\nIran, arguing that it will block Iran’s path to the bomb. \r\nThat is exactly what they said about the nuclear deal \r\nwith North Korea, and we all know how that turned out. \r\nUnfortunately, if nothing changes, this deal will turn \r\nout exactly the same way.\r\nThat is why Israel’s policy regarding the nuclear \r\ndeal with Iran is very simple — change it or cancel it, \r\nfix it or nix it. Nixing the deal means restoring massive \r\npressure on Iran, including crippling sanctions, until \r\nIran fully dismantles its nuclear-weapon capabilities. \r\nFixing the deal requires many things, among them \r\ninspecting military sites and any other site that is \r\nsuspect, and penalizing Iran for every violation. Above \r\nall, fixing the deal means getting rid of the sunset \r\nclause. Beyond fixing this bad deal, we must also stop \r\nIran’s development of ballistic missiles and roll back its \r\ngrowing aggression in the region.\r\nI remember we have had these debates. As \r\nmembers know, I took a fairly active role in them. \r\nMany supporters of the deal naively believed that \r\nit would somehow moderate Iran and make it a \r\n“responsible” member of the international community. \r\nI strongly disagreed. I warned that, when the sanctions \r\non Iran would be removed, Iran would behave like a \r\nhungry tiger unleashed — not joining the community \r\nof nations, but devouring nations one after the other. \r\nThat is precisely what Iran is doing today. From the \r\nCaspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, from Tehran \r\nto Tartus, an Iranian curtain is descending across the \r\nMiddle East. Iran spreads that curtain of tyranny and \r\nterror over Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere. And it \r\npledges to extinguish the light of Israel. Today I have \r\na simple message for Ayatollah Khamenei, the dictator \r\nof Iran: the light of Israel will never be extinguished.\r\nThose who threaten us with annihilation put \r\nthemselves in mortal peril. Israel will defend itself \r\nwith the full force of our arms and the full power \r\nof our convictions. We will act to prevent Iran from \r\nestablishing permanent military bases in Syria for \r\nits air, sea and ground forces. We will act to prevent \r\nIran from producing deadly weapons, in Syria or in \r\nLebanon, for use against us. And we will act to prevent \r\nIran from opening new terror fronts against Israel along \r\nour northern border. As long as Iran’s regime seeks the \r\ndestruction of Israel, Iran will face no fiercer enemy \r\nthan Israel.\r\nBut I also have a message today for the people of \r\nIran, who are not our enemy. They are our friends. One \r\nday my Iranian friends will be free from the evil regime \r\nthat terrorizes them, hangs gays, jails journalists, \r\ntortures political prisoners and shoots innocent women \r\nlike Neda Soltani, leaving her choking on her own blood \r\non the streets of Tehran. I have not forgotten Neda, and \r\nI am sure that neither have members. When the day \r\nof liberation for the people of Iran finally comes, the \r\nfriendship between our two ancient peoples will surely \r\nf lourish once again.\r\nIsrael knows that we are not alone in confronting \r\nthe Iranian regime. We stand shoulder to shoulder \r\nwith those in the Arab world who share our hopes for \r\na brighter future. We have made peace with Jordan and \r\nEgypt, whose courageous President, Mr. Abdel Fattah \r\nAl Sisi, I met here last night. I appreciate President Al \r\nSisi’s support for peace, and I hope to work closely with \r\nhim and other leaders in the region to advance peace. \r\nIsrael is committed to achieving peace with all of our \r\nArab neighbours, including the Palestinians.\r\nYesterday President Trump and I discussed all of \r\nthis at great length. I appreciate President Trump’s \r\nleadership, his commitment to stand by Israel’s side, \r\nhis commitment to advance a peaceful future for all. \r\nTogether, we can seize the opportunities for peace and \r\ntogether we can confront the great dangers of Iran. \r\nThe remarkable alliance between the United States \r\nand Israel has never been stronger and never been \r\ndeeper. Israel is deeply grateful for the support of the \r\nTrump Administration, the American Congress and the \r\nAmerican people.\r\nIn this year of historic visits and historic \r\nanniversaries, Israel has much to be grateful for. \r\nA hundred and twenty years ago, Theodor Herzl \r\nconvened the first Zionist Congress to transform \r\nour tragic past into a brilliant future by establishing \r\nthe Jewish State. One hundred years ago, the Balfour \r\nDeclaration advanced Herzl’s vision by recognizing \r\nthe right of the Jewish people to a national home in \r\nour ancestral homeland. Seventy years ago, the United \r\nNations further advanced that vision by adopting \r\nresolution 181 (II), supporting the establishment of a \r\nJewish State. Fifty years ago, we reunited our eternal \r\ncapital — Jerusalem — achieving a miraculous victory \r\nagainst those who sought to destroy our State. Theodor \r\nHerzl was our modern Moses, and his dream has come \r\ntrue. We have returned to the promised land, revived \r\nour language, ingathered our exiles and built a modern, \r\nthriving democracy.\r\nA/72/PV.4 19/09/2017\r\n28/28 17-29122\r\nTomorrow evening Jews around the world will \r\ncelebrate Rosh Hashanah, the beginning of our new \r\nyear. It is a time of reflection, and we look back with \r\nwonder at the remarkable and miraculous rebirth of \r\nour nation. We look ahead with pride to the remarkable \r\ncontributions Israel will continue to make to all nations. \r\nA simple look around will reveal those contributions \r\nevery day — in the food people eat, the water they \r\ndrink, the medicines they take, the cars they drive, the \r\ncell phones they use and in so many other ways that are \r\ntransforming our world. It can be seen in the smile of \r\nan African mother in a remote village who, thanks to \r\nan Israeli innovation, no longer must walk eight hours \r\na day to bring water to her children. It can be seen in \r\nthe eyes of an Arab child who has f lown to Israel to \r\nundergo a lifesaving heart operation. And it can be seen \r\nin the faces of the people in earthquake-stricken Haiti \r\nand Nepal, who are rescued from the rubble and given \r\nnew life by Israeli doctors.\r\nAs the prophet Isaiah said: “I have made you a light \r\nunto the nations, to be My salvation to the ends of the \r\nEarth.” Today, 2,700 years after Isaiah spoke those \r\nprophetic words, Israel is becoming a rising power \r\namong the nations. And, at long last, its light is shining \r\nacross the continents, bringing hope and salvation to \r\nthe ends of the Earth. Happy new year from Israel.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.20 p.m.\r\n"
