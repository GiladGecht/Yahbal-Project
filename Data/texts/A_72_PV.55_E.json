The \r\ndraft resolution has been submitted on behalf of the \r\nfive countries of Central Asia, namely, Kazakhstan, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and my own country, \r\nTurkmenistan, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive \r\nDiplomacy for Central Asia, and to emphasize its role \r\nin the region.\r\nCentral Asian countries would like to underscore \r\nthe unwavering and broad interregional support for \r\nthe draft resolution, and we have the honour to express \r\ndeep gratitude to the sponsoring countries. We would \r\nalso like to underline the constructive atmosphere of \r\nthe entire deliberation process of the draft resolution.\r\nPreventive diplomacy is one of the priorities of \r\nthe United Nations, whereby early warning and early \r\naction can advance security and stability, save lives \r\nand promote sustainable development. The United \r\nNations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy \r\nfor Central Asia (UNRCCA) is a special political \r\nmission of the United Nations, established in December \r\n2007 in Ashgabat at the initiative of the five Central \r\nAsian States.\r\nThe Centre promotes dialogue among the \r\nGovernments of the Central Asian countries on finding \r\nsolutions to emerging problems and on eliminating \r\npotential threats so as to keep regular contacts with \r\nregional and international organizations operating in \r\nthe region, to stimulate their peacemaking efforts and \r\ninitiatives and to cooperate with other United Nations \r\nagencies working in the field of sustainable development \r\nand conflict prevention.\r\nIn its 10 years of existence, the Centre has provided \r\nGovernments with a platform for dialogue on the \r\nmost challenging regional issues, ranging from the \r\nmanagement of common resources to transnational \r\nthreats, such as terrorism, violent extremism, organized \r\ncrime and drug and other forms of trafficking. In \r\ndoing so, UNRCCA has closely cooperated with all \r\nGovernments of the region and has built capacities to \r\nuse preventive diplomacy methods and instruments to \r\naddress existing and emerging challenges.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

He \r\npresented an opportunity to renew United Nations \r\nsupport to the ongoing efforts of regional cooperation \r\nand underlined the relevance of preventive diplomacy \r\nto Central Asia.\r\nThe draft resolution generalizes the experience \r\nof the Regional Centre for use by other countries \r\nof the world and emphasizes once again the role of \r\npreventive diplomacy.\r\nIn conclusion, on behalf of all sponsors, may I \r\nexpress our hope that this important draft resolution will \r\nreceive unanimous support and the wider sponsorship \r\nof Member States.\r\nThe President: The
