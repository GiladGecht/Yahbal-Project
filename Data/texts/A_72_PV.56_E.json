"United Nations A/72/PV.56\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n56th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 20 November 2017, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 39\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/72/312 and \r\nA/72/392)\r\nDraft resolution (A/72/L.8)\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Germany to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/72/L.8.\r\nMr. Heusgen (Germany): It is my great pleasure \r\nto introduce the draft resolution entitled “The situation \r\nin Afghanistan” (A/72/L.8). This draft resolution has \r\na long history in the General Assembly, it having first \r\nbeen adopted in 1980. Every year since then, in the \r\ndraft resolution the General Assembly has reflected the \r\ndevelopments in the country, the situation, the crisis, \r\nthe international community’s support for Afghanistan, \r\nand the fate of the Afghan people.\r\nGermany has facilitated, and been the penholder \r\nfor, the draft resolution since 2002, the year in which \r\nthe International Conference on Afghanistan was held \r\nat the Hotel Petersberg in Bonn, setting a milestone \r\nin the history of the country. Last year we completely \r\noverhauled the draft resolution, incorporating \r\nrecent developments and reflecting the international \r\ncommunity’s support for the country. This year we \r\nupdated the draft resolution, which involved rather \r\ndifficult negotiations. At this stage, I would also like to \r\npay tribute to all members of the General Assembly that \r\nactively tried to reach consensus. It has been hard work, \r\nand I thank all of those involved.\r\nDivergences among delegations persisted until the \r\nend of consultations. That is why the German penholder \r\ndecided to make a proposal designed to achieve \r\ncompromise among the diverging points of view. In \r\nthe discussions following the presentation, we actually \r\nmanaged to reach an agreement, which was endorsed by \r\na silent procedure.\r\nAs a result of the foregoing discussions, in \r\nmy capacity as facilitator, I would like to ask you, \r\nMr. President, that the word “dialogue” be added \r\nafter the word “Moscow” in paragraph 22 of the draft \r\nresolution. In addition, I would like to make a technical \r\nrevision to the text: in paragraph 56, the word “must” \r\nshould be replaced with the word “shall”. This change \r\ncorrects a technical error that occurred during the \r\nediting process; it brings the text back into line with \r\nwhat was agreed on by Member States.\r\nHaving overcome the divergences on what I would \r\ncall minor issues, I would like to recall the substance \r\nand meaning of the draft resolution. It is meant, first \r\nand foremost, as an expression of unified support for \r\nAfghanistan and its people by the entire membership of \r\nthe United Nations. I would like to express gratitude for \r\nthe fact that discussions have ended and that we have \r\nbeen able to demonstrate today this unified support.\r\nTurning to the substance of the draft resolution, \r\nour pre-eminent concern with respect to Afghanistan, \r\nwhich is also one of the most important points of the \r\ndraft resolution, is security. In the past year, illegal \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

I would like to take the \r\nopportunity of the presence of the Chief Executive of \r\nAfghanistan, Mr. Abdullah, to convey to him our deep \r\ncondolences for the Afghan lives that have been lost to \r\nterrorism and violence. I would especially mention the \r\ndespicable acts of violence, including attacks against \r\nShia mosques and other attacks, which have sought to \r\ndivide Afghanistan and its people on social, ethnic and \r\nreligious grounds.\r\nThe international community, which has also been \r\nhit by terrorist attacks, is trying to help Afghanistan and \r\nits people. We strongly condemn all of those attacks and \r\nwish to mention in particular the devastating suicide \r\nattack that took place in front of the German Embassy \r\non 31 May. I would pay particular tribute to the Afghan \r\nsecurity forces for the sacrifices they have made. \r\nTogether with our partners, Germany will continue \r\nto support Afghanistan. NATO will also continue to \r\nsupport the country with the Resolute Support Mission \r\nand will try to re-establish peace and stability there. \r\nIn that context, we welcome the commitment and \r\nconditions-based approach that forms the substance of \r\nthe new Afghanistan strategies of the European Union \r\nand of the United States.\r\nThree things are needed to improve the situation \r\nin Afghanistan: first, support for the security sector; \r\nsecondly, support for civilian development; and, \r\nthirdly, diplomatic efforts aimed at addressing the \r\npolitical situation.\r\nAn inclusive Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace \r\nprocess involving the Government of Afghanistan and \r\nthe Taliban is the only way to achieve a sustainable \r\nresolution of the conflict. We therefore welcome the \r\nstrategic plan for peace and reconciliation that was \r\npresented by the Afghanistan High Peace Council, as \r\nwell as the initiation of the Kabul process on 6 June, \r\nwith the aim of ensuring unified and close coordination \r\nof efforts under the leadership and ownership of the \r\nAfghan Government. On behalf of the international \r\ncommunity, the draft resolution calls on all parties to \r\nrecognize their responsibility for peace, and it calls in \r\nparticular on the Taliban to enter into direct talks.\r\nThe draft resolution welcomes the announcement \r\nof the ambitious plan to hold parliamentary elections \r\nnext year. We call on the Government to accelerate the \r\npreparatory work in creating the conditions needed for \r\na transparent, credible and inclusive electoral process, \r\nthereby strengthening the trust of the population in \r\ndemocratic institutions.\r\nWe commend the Government of Afghanistan for \r\nthe progress made in its reform agenda, as presented at \r\nthe senior officials meeting in Kabul on 4 and 5 October. \r\nWe are all aware of the persistent challenges, including \r\nthe fight against corruption, which is key, and the need \r\nfor continued and determined progress on political and \r\neconomic reform. We encourage the Government to do \r\nits utmost to implement those reforms.\r\nIn conclusion, Germany aligns itself with the \r\nstatement to be delivered by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union later today. As Germany remains \r\ncommitted to Afghanistan and to the Afghan people, \r\nwe will continue our active engagement in the country.\r\nMr. Abdullah (Afghanistan): We thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening today’s debate on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan. It is my pleasure to be here \r\nwith my delegation as the General Assembly adopts its \r\nannual draft resolution on Afghanistan (A/72/L.8). This \r\noccasion reflects the international community’s strong \r\nconsensus on the imperative of ensuring stability and \r\nprosperity in my country, and we look forward to the \r\nemergence of a peaceful regional environment.\r\nThis year the delegation of Germany again \r\ndemonstrated its excellent leadership of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the draft resolution \r\nthat will be adopted later today. We thank the Permanent \r\nMission of Germany for its efforts in that regard, \r\nand, more broadly, I express my appreciation to all \r\ndelegations for contributing to the negotiations process.\r\nSeventy-one years ago yesterday, Afghanistan \r\nbecame the fifty-second Member of the great family \r\nthat is the United Nations. However, since the late \r\n1970s, my country has undergone severe trauma \r\nafter suffering tremendous loses caused by imposed \r\nconflicts and in the war against terrorism and violent \r\nextremism, which continue to hurt us. Despite the \r\nhardship, Afghanistan has today regained its status as \r\na responsible member of the international community. \r\nThe unanimous adoption of this year’s draft resolution \r\nwill signal the overwhelming support of the world, \r\nwhich is standing behind us as we continue our quest \r\nfor lasting peace and prosperity in Afghanistan.\r\nMy presence here today attests to the importance \r\nthat the Government and the people of Afghanistan \r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 3/29\r\nattach to the draft resolution and, more specifically, to \r\nits more focused implementation. We therefore expect \r\nand request that Member States view the draft resolution \r\nin that way too. Despite the challenges confronting \r\nus, Afghanistan stands resilient and confident in its \r\nstance at home and abroad. We are a nation firmly \r\ncommitted to the ideals of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the vision of a global landscape anchored \r\nin peace, sovereignty, mutual respect and cooperation \r\nfor our common benefit. We equally value our bond of \r\npartnership with the United Nations, which has always \r\nstood in strong support and solidarity with our nation, \r\nespecially in the most difficult times. Today the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and all \r\nthe relevant United Nations agencies on the ground \r\ncontinue to play an important role in helping us with \r\nvarious aspects of recovery, rebuilding, humanitarian \r\nassistance and the seeking of a peaceful resolution to \r\nour political and security issues.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s United \r\nNations reform initiative in the hope that it will \r\nexpedite our realization of a ”One United Nations” \r\napproach in Afghanistan. Today we are reciprocating \r\nthe international community’s generosity through \r\nour active engagement and positive contributions. \r\nAfghanistan’s recent election to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the first time and its membership in the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, its vice-presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly, its active involvement in other \r\nforums and the successful adoption of two Afghan-\r\ninitiated draft resolutions — on countering the threat \r\nposed by improvised explosive devices and on the \r\nproclamation of 19 August as the International Day \r\nof Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of \r\nTerrorism — stand as a testament to our national will, \r\ndiplomatic efforts and eagerness to be an effective \r\ncontributor to the global good.\r\nLet me now provide an update on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan.\r\nWith regard to security, over the past several months \r\nour national security forces have effectively thwarted \r\nefforts by the Taliban working alongside its affiliated \r\nHaqqani Network, elements of Al-Qaida, Da’esh and \r\nother recognized terror groups aimed at making notable \r\ngains or capturing a major urban centre. We are not \r\ndealing with one but several terror outfits that either \r\nmirror one another under different labels or indirectly \r\nsupport overlapping agendas. We are grateful to all \r\ninternational partners for the contributions they have \r\nmade to equipping and training our security forces, \r\nwhich have courageously and at a high cost led the fight \r\nagainst those terrorist and violent extremist groups \r\nthreatening us, the region and many others beyond our \r\nborders.\r\nThe draft resolution also reaffirms the importance \r\nof the international community’s continued support for \r\nthe Afghan National Security Forces. To that end, we \r\nhave adopted new measures to complement and better \r\ncoordinate with the newly announced strategies devised \r\nby the United States, NATO and the European Union, \r\ninter alia, which came as a response to our enduring \r\nrequest for sustained international support for security \r\nand stability in Afghanistan — be it military or civilian \r\nin nature.\r\nWe firmly believe that a conditions-based approach \r\nand clear focus on resolving the problem of regional \r\nterrorist sanctuaries and support systems will bring \r\nus closer to peace and stability. They also form the \r\ncornerstone of our new national security strategy to \r\ndefeat terrorism, work with nations that share our threat \r\nperception and protect our people against politicized \r\nviolence. We have long asserted our desire to have \r\nfriendly relations with all nations. We have taken \r\nevery opportunity to make it clear through words and \r\ndeeds that we will never allow our relations with any \r\nsingle country or group of countries to overshadow or \r\nadversely affect our relations with others in the region \r\nor beyond. Afghanistan should be seen as a strategic \r\nasset and a platform of cordiality for all. We consider \r\nnegative State rivalries and the use of violent proxy \r\nforces as counter-productive. There is no such thing as \r\na good violent extremist or terrorist. We need to agree \r\nto fight all forms and shades of terror. We can, and \r\nshould, no longer harbour or support one group while \r\nfighting another and claim to be combating terrorism in \r\nall its dimensions.\r\nThis year’s draft resolution also recognizes the \r\ncentrality of Afghanistan’s role in leading peace efforts \r\nwithin the framework of the Kabul Process for Peace \r\nand Security Cooperation to supplement initiatives \r\nfor action-oriented cooperation. Those efforts will \r\nalso be guided by Afghanistan’s High Peace Council’s \r\nnew strategic plan, which is centre upon a whole-of-\r\nsociety approach to promoting peace. At the regional \r\nlevel, fostering stable and constructive relations with \r\nall our neighbours, especially Pakistan, remains a key \r\ncomponent of our peace strategy. President Ashraf \r\nGhani and I hope that, this time around, action against \r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n4/29 17-39043\r\nall forms of terrorism will speak louder than words. It \r\nshould be noted that changing the status quo will be \r\npossible only when terror subsides, infringements on \r\nour territory come to a halt and safe havens are shut \r\ndown. Failure to do so will have negative consequences \r\nand result in further tensions, or worse.\r\nThrough the Afghanistan National Peace and \r\nDevelopment Framework, we have adopted concrete \r\nand systemic measures to implement a reform agenda, \r\noffer better governance and strive towards achieving \r\ngreater self-reliance. Our economy, hurt by the 2014 \r\nending of the combat mission by international forces \r\nas a result of our reliance upon large-scale military \r\nexpenditures, has turned a corner and is showing signs \r\nof recovery, especially with regard to private-sector \r\ninvestment and development.\r\nSince the formation of the Government of \r\nNational Unity, domestic revenue has seen important \r\ngains, which in turn have helped us shoulder more \r\nresponsibility for our security and development needs. \r\nMoreover, we are making steady progress in the \r\ndevelopment of our national infrastructure, including \r\nroads, industry, energy, telecommunications and \r\ntransport networks. Once completed, these projects will \r\nimprove connectivity and generate economic growth in \r\nAfghanistan and our region.\r\nOnce an ambitious vision, the regional economic \r\ncooperation agenda is becoming reality. Afghanistan \r\nis being transformed into a hub for regional and \r\ninternational trade, transit and transport. Energy \r\ntransfer is a major component of this transformation \r\nnow and will be so in future. I am pleased to highlight \r\nthe successful outcome of the seventh Regional \r\nEconomic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan, \r\nheld in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, last week, where \r\nAfghanistan, regional countries and other international \r\nstakeholders recommitted to the full implementation \r\nof at least 18 major regional projects, including the \r\nCASA-1000 and Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-\r\nIndia energy and natural-gas initiatives, as well as \r\nthe Chabahar International Transport and Transit \r\nCorridor project.\r\nThe recent historic signing of the Lapis Lazuli \r\nTransit, Trade and Transport Route agreement among \r\nAfghanistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia and \r\nTurkey marks another important development in the \r\nadvancement of economic and cultural links in the \r\nregion. Additionally, the air corridor with India has \r\nincreased trade volume between our countries, while \r\nmajor railway projects with China, the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan are also \r\nmoving forward. All in all, these mega-projects hold \r\nthe promise of propelling us and the wider region into a \r\nnew era of economic prosperity.\r\nWe in the Government of National Unity recognize \r\nthat strengthening good governance and the rule of \r\nlaw is imperative for our stability and prosperity. We \r\nare making every effort to fulfil the commitments we \r\nmade at the London, Warsaw and Brussels Conferences \r\nin 2014 and 2016.\r\nThe National Strategy for Combating \r\nCorruption — a living document adopted in \r\nSeptember — lays out clear strategies and solutions for \r\nsystemic reforms across Government institutions and \r\nagencies. An example of a system that has seen reform \r\nis the public civil administration. The Supreme Court, \r\nthe Attorney General’s Office and the Anti-Corruption \r\nJustice Centre have so far tried more than 1,000 cases \r\nof corruption, bribery and abuse of authority, including \r\nby senior-ranking officials. We have made clear to our \r\npeople and our international partners that the principle \r\nof accountability will not be compromised at any cost. \r\nIn the area of fiscal sustainability, we have improved \r\nour financial systems to the point where they have \r\nbeen declared to be in conformity with international \r\nstandards. Our efforts in the areas of the rule of law and \r\ngovernance will continue as a matter of priority.\r\nPrevailing insecurity has also led to an increase \r\nin drug production in some parts of the country. The \r\ndangerous nexus between terrorism and narcotic drugs \r\ntherefore demands a more focused and collective effort \r\nfrom within the region and beyond.\r\nThe full participation of women in sociopolitical \r\nprocesses and the economy remains a core priority, \r\nin line with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). \r\nToday, Afghan women proudly represent our country \r\nin all spheres. I would especially like to thank the more \r\nthan 8,500 women who are serving in our security \r\nforces. Their contribution and sacrifice are helping us \r\ndeal with cases of criminality, violence and abuse.\r\nFinally, I would like to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the most important aspect of political \r\nstability: learning from the past and ensuring free, \r\nfair and transparent elections. We are in preparation \r\nmode, working alongside the Independent Election \r\nCommission, to bring necessary reforms to the \r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 5/29\r\nelectoral process so that public participation and trust \r\nin it are restored. This is a critical pledge. We are \r\ncommitted to holding parliamentary elections in 2018, \r\nfollowed by presidential elections in 2019. We thank the \r\nUnited Nations and all other partners for their help in \r\nthis regard.\r\nTo conclude, I can say with utmost confidence that \r\nthe contributions, investments and joint sacrifices made \r\nin the past 17 years have made a tremendous difference. \r\nFrom a domestic standpoint, the notable gains made \r\nacross various sectors have had a profound impact in \r\nimproving the lives of ordinary Afghans throughout \r\nour country. Our civil society is vibrant, our free \r\nmedia is functioning, providing checks and balances \r\nto the system, and our growing youth population is \r\nless inclined than before to leave the country, as young \r\npeople see opportunities and prospects at home. Just \r\ntwo days ago, our Under-19 national cricket team won \r\nthe Asia Cup in Malaysia.\r\nAll in all, we are committed to continuing this \r\njourney based on the wishes of the Afghan people and \r\nenjoying the support of the international community. \r\nOnce again, with security being a vital priority for us \r\nand with so many across our region and beyond being \r\naffected by insecurity at this important juncture, let us \r\nreinvigorate the spirit of international partnership and \r\neffective engagement in which the global fight against \r\nterrorism began 17 years ago. Doing so provides the \r\nbest guarantee for the security and prosperity of all \r\nour nations.\r\nThe President: I give the f loor to the observer of \r\nthe European Union.\r\nMr. Dvořák (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and its \r\nmember States. The candidate countries Turkey, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, \r\nSerbia and Albania; the country of the Stabilization \r\nand Association Process and potential candidate Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina; as well as Ukraine, the Republic \r\nof Moldova and Georgia, align themselves with \r\nthis statement.\r\nI would like to thank the Chief Executive of \r\nAfghanistan, Mr. Abdullah Abdullah, for his statement. \r\nI also thank all the delegations that have participated \r\nin the consultations on the draft resolution (A/72/L.8), \r\nparticularly the German team for so ably facilitating \r\nthe negotiations thereon. We are once again looking \r\nforward to adoption of the draft resolution by consensus.\r\nMore than a year ago, at the Brussels Conference \r\non Afghanistan, the international community \r\nconfirmed its substantial political and financial \r\nsupport for Afghanistan. To recall, the international \r\ncommunity pledged $15 billion until 2020, out of \r\nwhich the European Union and its member States \r\nwould contribute $5 billion. This pledge was made \r\nagainst a comprehensive and detailed Afghan reform \r\nprogramme presented during the Conference. Now, one \r\nyear later, we can see progress in a number of areas, but \r\nmajor challenges remain. In addition, the challenging \r\nsecurity situation in the country has made our work \r\nmore difficult.\r\nOn behalf of the European Union and its member \r\nStates, I would like to underline that we have delivered \r\non our commitments. On 16 October, the Ministers \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the EU member States approved \r\na new European Union strategy on Afghanistan, \r\nreconfirming the long-term commitment of the EU \r\nand its member States to promoting peace, stability \r\nand prosperity in Afghanistan and to support its \r\nsustainable development. The new EU strategy focuses \r\non four priority areas critical to achieving progress in \r\nAfghanistan: promoting peace, stability and regional \r\nsecurity; reinforcing democracy, the rule of law and \r\nhuman rights and promoting good governance and \r\nwomen’s empowerment; supporting economic and \r\nhuman development; and addressing challenges related \r\nto migration.\r\nIn recent years, Afghanistan has been confronted \r\nwith a number of challenges that threaten the progress \r\nmade in its economic and social development and its \r\ndemocratic institutions. The European Union recognizes \r\nthat the country’s delicate security situation and the \r\nfragile economic state of affairs, combined with a clear \r\ndetermination on the part of the Afghan authorities to \r\nimplement much-needed reforms, necessitates renewed \r\nattention from the international community.\r\nThe new strategy is the latest illustration of the \r\nEuropean Union’s strong engagement in and firm \r\ncommitment to Afghanistan. Notably, it follows the \r\nBrussels Conference on Afghanistan, the signing \r\nin February of a new EU-Afghanistan Cooperation \r\nAgreement on Partnership and Development, and \r\nthe appointment in June of an EU Special Envoy \r\nto Afghanistan. The EU-Afghanistan Cooperation \r\nAgreement on Partnership and Development represents \r\nthe first legal framework governing cooperation \r\nbetween the EU and Afghanistan. The provisional \r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n6/29 17-39043\r\napplication of the Cooperation Agreement will allow \r\nus to strengthen our existing dialogue and explore new \r\nareas of cooperation. A joint committee will ensure \r\nthe Agreement’s proper functioning by overseeing its \r\nimplementation. Two special working groups will also \r\nbe created in order to deepen the sectoral dialogue \r\non human rights, good governance, migration and \r\neconomic and social development.\r\nPeace in Afghanistan will benefit not only all \r\nAfghans, but also the entire region and the international \r\ncommunity as a whole. This was also a key message of \r\nthe Brussels Conference last year and is the focus of the \r\nnew EU strategy. Security and sustainable development \r\nare interconnected challenges in a State-building \r\nprocess that needs to be underpinned by genuine \r\npolitical support from the region. The EU urges all \r\nregional stakeholders to cooperate constructively \r\nin order to promote a genuine and results-oriented \r\nnegotiation process without preconditions aimed at \r\ncreating a lasting settlement between the parties to the \r\nconflict. Such a settlement will provide the foundation \r\nfor peace, security and prosperity in Afghanistan and \r\nthe wider region.\r\nThe European Union remains fully committed to \r\nsupporting an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace \r\nprocess. Such a process must include all Afghan men \r\nand women, protect their legitimate interests and \r\npreserve Afghanistan’s unity, sovereignty, territorial \r\nintegrity and the equal rights of all Afghans under \r\nthe Constitution of Afghanistan. Furthermore, the \r\nEU supports the Kabul Process on Peace and Security \r\nCooperation and other international efforts to establish \r\na genuine Afghan peace and reconciliation process. \r\nThe Kabul Process is expected to encourage further \r\ndiscussions among Afghanistan and its neighbouring \r\ncountries so as to increase regional cooperation for \r\npeace and stability.\r\nWe particularly encourage the Afghan Government \r\nto engage in a political process with the Taliban and \r\nother Afghan opposition groups in order to reach \r\na lasting political settlement. We also welcome all \r\ninitiatives to create an environment conducive to the \r\nsuccess of this process and call on all parties to engage \r\nin constructive solutions.\r\nThe EU is alarmed by the high level of violence \r\nand large number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan, \r\nincluding women and children. Improving security \r\nremains fundamental for stability and development in \r\nAfghanistan. The EU is committed to working with the \r\ncountry to combat terrorism, the financing of terrorism \r\nand terrorist threats in all their forms, and to step \r\nup dialogue and cooperation to prevent and counter \r\nviolent extremism, radicalization and recruitment and \r\naddress their root causes. The EU welcomes the Afghan \r\nGovernment’s four-year security-sector reform plan and \r\ncommends the efforts made in support of a sufficient \r\nand increasingly sustainable Afghan National Defence \r\nand Security Forces, as endorsed by Afghanistan and \r\ncountries contributing to the Resolute Support Mission \r\nat the NATO Warsaw Summit in July 2016.\r\nThe EU welcomed the announcement of the Afghan \r\nparliamentary and district council elections for 2018. \r\nOur expectation is that they will be held in an inclusive, \r\ntransparent and credible manner. But for that to be \r\npossible, key decisions on electoral reforms need to be \r\ntaken as a matter of urgency. The EU followed closely \r\nall developments on elections, in coordination with the \r\ninternational community. We will remain committed \r\nto supporting the Afghan electoral process and the \r\nright of Afghan citizens to exercise their civic and \r\ndemocratic rights.\r\nHuman rights is an area of high importance in \r\nthe EU-Afghanistan dialogue. On 14 August, the \r\nEU, together with member States and the Afghan \r\nGovernment, organized the third EU-Afghanistan \r\nhigh-level meeting on human rights, taking stock of the \r\nprogress made so far and looking forward to the future \r\nand to addressing the many challenges that still exist \r\non the ground.\r\nIn its actions, the EU puts a particular emphasis on \r\nwomen’s empowerment, education for girls and fighting \r\nviolence against women, and we encourage the Afghan \r\nGovernment to make further efforts in these areas. \r\nThe EU supports the implementation of Afghanistan’s \r\nnational action plan on women, peace and security, \r\ncreated pursuant to Security Council resolution 1325 \r\n(2000), with projects and actions in several provinces. \r\nThe fourth Kabul Symposium on Afghan women, \r\nentitled “Afghan Women: Messengers of Peace”, held \r\nin May, offered an additional opportunity to reiterate \r\nthe importance of women’s participation in peace \r\nprocesses. We believe that the Kabul Symposium can \r\nbecome a mechanism to formulate Afghan women’s \r\nexpectations and monitor the Government’s progress \r\nin delivery.\r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 7/29\r\nThe EU supports Afghanistan in its fight against \r\ncorruption in the country’s justice sector, parliament \r\nand civil society, and welcomes the adoption of its \r\nanti-corruption strategy in October. The focus must \r\nnow be on the implementation of this strategy.\r\nMigration continues to be high on the EU’s agenda \r\nand is an important subject of discussion with our \r\nAfghan partners. The new EU strategy on Afghanistan \r\nincludes migration among its priorities, confirming \r\nthe importance of widening the scope of the EU-\r\nAfghanistan migration dialogue. We discuss bilateral \r\ncooperation, but also the regional and multilateral \r\ncontext. We have continued our cooperation in the \r\nframework of the EU-Afghanistan Joint Way Forward \r\non migration issues, a political platform for managing \r\nmigration in a sustainable way, based on solidarity, \r\ndialogue and respect for human rights.\r\nSimilarly, with regard to Afghan refugees, our \r\nattention has been focused on development at the \r\nregional level. In parallel with regular political dialogue \r\nwith relevant partners, the EU took concrete actions \r\nthrough a comprehensive approach to address the \r\nkey challenges of migration and forced displacement \r\nin Afghanistan and in the region. To this end, two \r\nmulti-country regional programmes were adopted \r\nin 2016 and 2017, with budgets of €91.6 million and \r\n€195.6 million, respectively. The United Nations-\r\nlevel global compacts for 2018 will offer an additional \r\nopportunity for the EU and Afghanistan to coordinate \r\nand respond to the challenges migration poses today in \r\nour societies and in the international arena.\r\nFinally, insecurity and instability are also fuelled \r\nby the illicit cultivation, production and trafficking \r\nof narcotics. We have just seen the alarming recently \r\npublished United Nations figures showing an 87 per \r\ncent increase in opium production, to a record level \r\nof 9,000 tons. This remains an important concern for \r\nthe European Union, with severe consequences for \r\nAfghanistan, including high consumption rates within \r\nthe population, the fuelling of the illicit economy, \r\nthe corruption of institutions and the financing of \r\ninternational terrorism. We therefore encourage the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan to continue to forcefully \r\nimplement its National Drug Action Plan with the full \r\nsupport of the international community and in close \r\ncooperation with the United Nations Office on Drugs \r\nand Crime and other relevant regional frameworks, \r\nsuch as the Paris Pact Initiative.\r\nIn conclusion, in addition to the foregoing, we must \r\nalso point out that the EU emphatically acknowledges \r\nthe crucial role played by the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan and all the United Nations \r\nagencies in supporting the Afghan people, encouraging \r\npeace and reconciliation, monitoring and promoting \r\nhuman rights, and coordinating the international \r\ncommunity’s assistance. It is important that the \r\ninternational community remain strongly committed to \r\naccompanying Afghanistan towards lasting peace and \r\nstability. We will continue to support the transformation \r\nprocess to promote the emergence of a fully self-reliant, \r\npeaceful, democratic and prosperous society for the \r\nbenefit of all Afghans.\r\nMs. Wilson (Australia): As an ardent supporter of \r\nthe international consensus on Afghanistan, Australia \r\nis proud to co-sponsor draft resolution A/72/L.8. At a \r\nmoment where this consensus has become brittle, we \r\nacknowledge the work of all countries in developing a \r\ndraft resolution that reflects constructive engagement \r\nin support of security, stability and development \r\nin Afghanistan, in partnership with the National \r\nUnity Government.\r\nIn 2017, the international community reaffirmed \r\nits support for Afghanistan, including through the \r\nUnited States-South Asia strategy, a renewed NATO \r\ncommitment, the European Union strategy and Shanghai \r\nCooperation Organization engagement. Australia \r\naffirms these efforts and believes an integrated regional \r\napproach to Afghanistan’s challenges — including \r\nproperly resourced diplomatic, development and \r\ndefence efforts — can help improve Afghanistan’s \r\nprospects, reduce its dependence on international \r\nassistance and chart a path toward credible peace.\r\nWe commend the efforts of Afghanistan and its \r\nregional partners to increase trade and investment \r\nthrough greater regional economic cooperation. We \r\ncongratulate the National Unity Government for \r\novercoming significant challenges in 2017 and note \r\nothers ongoing, including responding to more than \r\n1 million Afghan returnees and the difficult security \r\nenvironment. Australia welcomes the progress \r\nagainst corruption, specifically by the work of the \r\nAnti-Corruption Justice Centre. We encourage the \r\nAfghan Government to persist in making Afghan \r\ninstitutions more transparent and accountable. \r\nConducting timely elections will be critical to \r\naccountability. We encourage the Afghan Government \r\nto continue to work to hold free and fair elections.\r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n8/29 17-39043\r\nEvents in 2017 tragically reminded us of the \r\nhuman cost of insecurity and the scale of the challenge \r\nbefore us. We welcome the commitment of the Afghan \r\nGovernment to security-sector reform, including the \r\nAfghan National Defence and Security Forces road \r\nmap and the achievement of its milestones. Australia \r\nremains committed to Afghanistan’s long-term security \r\nand development. In 2017, alongside our international \r\npartners, Australia announced a modest increase in \r\nits military commitment to train, advise and assist the \r\ncourageous and resilient Afghan security forces working \r\nto secure the country and its future. During an April \r\nvisit by President Ghani to Australia, we reaffirmed our \r\ncommitment to development cooperation by signing an \r\nupdated and renewed bilateral development partnership \r\nagreement. This partnership recognized the important \r\ntask of empowering women and girls and meeting the \r\nneeds of vulnerable populations.\r\nHowever, ensuring Afghanistan’s future is not \r\njust about security. Violence and instability are not \r\ninevitable. Australia continues to support an Afghan-\r\nowned negotiated political solution as the most \r\nsustainable path to peace. We encourage Afghanistan \r\nand its partners to look for opportunities for an \r\ninclusive, pragmatic dialogue to end violence and create \r\na coherent vision for the country’s future, including \r\nthrough the Kabul process.\r\nDraft resolution A/72/L.8 is a vital way for the \r\ninternational community to express support for \r\nAfghanistan and its people. I wish to record Australia’s \r\nadmiration and appreciation for the work of the Chair \r\nof the negotiations in developing the draft resolution \r\nand commend it to the Assembly.\r\nMr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian Federation supports the adoption \r\nby consensus of draft resolution A/72/L.8, on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan, which was intended to reflect \r\nin a targeted and comprehensive manner the collective \r\napproaches of the international community to reach an \r\neffective and long-term Afghan settlement. This was \r\nachieved largely by taking into account the friendly \r\nrelations and positive experience of cooperating with \r\nKabul at the United Nations. However, we would like to \r\nnote that, in reaching agreement on the text, a number \r\nof Russian concerns were not taken into account.\r\nMr. Tevi (Vanuatu), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nWe are troubled by the current state of affairs in \r\nAfghanistan. The spillover of the terrorist threat to \r\nCentral Asia and Russia runs counter to our national \r\ninterests. By adopting this draft resolution, we trust that \r\nwhen the next draft resolution is drafted, we will receive \r\nthorough and detailed reports on the concrete results \r\nof the 16-year struggle against terrorism and narcotics \r\ntrafficking and on the reasons for the unprecedented \r\nexpansion of opium-poppy cultivation, which plays into \r\nthe hands of international terrorist organizations.\r\nThe deliberate information campaign based on \r\nthe unfounded accusation that the Russian Federation \r\nsupports the Taliban, including by financing it and \r\nproviding it with weapons, is unacceptable. We see \r\nthis as an attempt to assign blame and use us as a \r\nscapegoat. So far, the discussions of the draft resolution \r\nhave shown that Russia alone has called consistently \r\nand systematically for the Taliban movement to be \r\nfully reclassified as a terrorist group, which would \r\npreclude any possible relaxation of its members’ \r\ncriminal prosecution. We will continue to insist on that \r\napproach as long as we see no alternative, and we will \r\nnever accept loopholes that enable terrorists to avoid \r\naccountability while hiding behind the tired concept of \r\ncountering violent extremism.\r\nWe are concerned about the state of the Afghan \r\nNational Security Forces. We deplore the decision to \r\nreplace its Russian aircraft and small arms and the \r\nreform lowering the upper age limit for officers, which \r\nwill result in the premature retirement of several \r\nthousand highly qualified soldiers.\r\nUnfortunately, we see no progress in national \r\nreconciliation. In that regard, we believe that the \r\nMoscow format for consultations launched at the \r\nbeginning of this year is the best possible platform for \r\nengaging in substantive negotiations to facilitate that \r\nprocess. We believe that its underlying principle of \r\nfrank and equitable partnership with the participation \r\nof every country in the region will help to achieve \r\nits objectives.\r\nThe spring-summer campaign has not yielded \r\nthe expected results for the Taliban movement, but in \r\nspite of that it still controls about half of the country’s \r\nterritory and continues to stage serious acts of terror \r\nand engage in subversive activity. The Afghan branch \r\nof the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is also \r\nstrengthening its position and according to our estimates \r\nnow numbers 10,000 people. Its ranks are mainly being \r\nreplenished by foreign terrorist fighters moving into \r\nAfghanistan after gaining combat experience in Syria \r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 9/29\r\nand Iraq. We would also like to point to the signs of \r\noutside support for ISIL evidenced by sightings of \r\nunmarked helicopters.\r\nYet another seriously worrying issue is the \r\nunprecedented surge in drug production. That trend is \r\nstarkly confirmed by the numbers in the most recent \r\nreport of the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime, which show that this year the acreage under \r\ndrug cultivation grew by 60 per cent, while opium \r\nproduction nearly doubled. That represents 7 per cent \r\nof the country’s gross domestic product. Narcodollars \r\nmake up a significant portion — between 35 and 40 per \r\ncent — of terrorist revenue. We therefore urge that the \r\ninternational community ramp up its efforts to combat \r\nAfghan drug trafficking. We see good possibilities \r\nhere through strengthening cooperation in this area \r\nbetween Afghanistan and the Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to stress that the \r\nRussian Federation robustly and steadfastly supports \r\nthe Afghan people’s aspiration for lasting peace in the \r\ncountry. The traditionally friendly relations between \r\nour two countries reflect the national interests of both \r\nof us. However, bringing stability to Afghanistan and \r\naddressing the challenges it is facing will be possible \r\nonly through a comprehensive approach on the part \r\nof the international community. We stand ready to \r\ncontinue to work to improve the coordination of all \r\nStates’ efforts in the interests of peace in Afghanistan.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): The General Assembly first \r\nadopted a resolution on Afghanistan in 1980 (resolution \r\n35/37). It is therefore not out of place today to briefly \r\nrecall the circumstances that produced that resolution \r\nand the way in which they have changed. Since 1980, \r\nAfghanistan has transitioned through almost four \r\ndecades of foreign military interventions and civil wars \r\nthat have inflicted endless suffering on the Afghan \r\npeople, including millions of innocent men, women \r\nand children. What has remained constant throughout \r\nthat period is the international community’s support \r\nfor the people of Afghanistan. The annual General \r\nAssembly resolution on the subject is an expression \r\nand embodiment of that global support. We commend \r\nthe efforts of Germany in once again steering the \r\nnegotiations on draft resolution A/72/L.8 on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan, of which Pakistan is once \r\nagain a sponsor.\r\nApart from the people of Afghanistan, it is the \r\npeople of Pakistan who have suffered the most from \r\nthe decades of war and violence in that country. The \r\nconflict next door has fundamentally altered and \r\naffected Pakistan’s polity, economy and society. Our \r\nresponse to the suffering of our Afghan brothers and \r\nsisters has been marked by empathy and generosity. \r\nMy country has offered unprecedented hospitality \r\nand support to the Afghan people in the past several \r\ndecades of their travail and tragedy. For more than three \r\ndecades, we have continued to host close to 3 million \r\nAfghan refugees, the largest protracted presence of \r\nrefugees anywhere in the world.\r\nUnfortunately, the long war in Afghanistan \r\ncontinues. Over the past year, the security situation \r\nhas deteriorated further, with violent insurgent attacks \r\nproliferating across the country. Civilian casualties have \r\ncontinued to rise owing to these attacks and escalating \r\nair strikes. Pakistan strongly condemns the repeated \r\nlarge-scale, orchestrated terrorist attacks in Kabul and \r\nelsewhere in Afghanistan. There can be no justification \r\nfor indiscriminate attacks on innocent children, women \r\nand men. The intensifying violence and instability in \r\nAfghanistan, and the growing presence of Da’esh and \r\na large number of other terrorist and militant groups in \r\nits ungoverned spaces, is cause for grave concern for \r\nthe Afghan people, Afghanistan’s neighbours and the \r\ninternational community. Such terrorist groups pose a \r\nclear and present danger to the long-term stability of \r\nAfghanistan and the entire region.\r\nThe nexus between terrorism and drug trafficking \r\nhelps to sustain terrorist and extremist groups in \r\nAfghanistan. The latest report of the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime indicates that drug \r\nproduction in Afghanistan has rapidly increased.\r\nThe prolonged conflict in Afghanistan has not \r\nonly inflicted epic suffering on its people, it has also \r\nprevented Afghanistan and the entire region from \r\nrealizing its immense economic potential. A peaceful \r\nand stable Afghanistan is essential to regional stability \r\nand economic progress.\r\nPakistan has been obliged to address the fallout \r\nfrom Afghanistan’s serial crises, including terrorism. \r\nWe have deployed 200,000 troops on our western border \r\nand conducted the largest anti-terrorism campaign in \r\nthe world. Those military campaigns have succeeded \r\nin clearing our tribal areas of almost all militant \r\nand terrorist groups. But in doing so, we have paid a \r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n10/29 17-39043\r\nheavy price. More than 27,000 Pakistanis, including \r\n6,500 military and law-enforcement personnel, have \r\nbeen martyred as a result of terrorist attacks, while \r\nPakistan’s economic losses are estimated at more \r\nthan $120 billion. Yet we remain committed to fully \r\nimplementing our campaign against terrorism and \r\nviolent extremism. Defeating terrorist violence is vital \r\nto realizing our overriding priority of rapid economic \r\nand social development.\r\nCooperation between Pakistan and Afghanistan is \r\na vital component of the effort to achieve peace and \r\nsecurity within Afghanistan and the entire region. We \r\nhave a long shared border that is not easy to control. \r\nIt is in that spirit of cooperation that we have shared \r\ncomprehensive proposals with our neighbour for \r\nmonitoring and controlling the border and for effective \r\nborder management. They include the establishment \r\nof a ground coordination centre and the deployment of \r\nliaison officers on the international border. We believe \r\nthat such measures can play a vital role in stopping \r\nthe cross-border movement of terrorists and militants, \r\nand we hope that the Afghan Government will respond \r\npositively to our proposal to strengthen and reinforce \r\nborder controls.\r\nOver the years, Pakistan has also taken comprehensive \r\nand concrete steps to support Afghanistan’s economy \r\nand development.We facilitate the transit of Afghan \r\ngoods without any quantitative restrictions. We have \r\nrecently taken a series of additional measures to \r\nfacilitate transit trade, including the establishment of \r\nround-the-clock dedicated trade posts, the improvement \r\nof customs and immigration infrastructure at border \r\ncrossing points and the creation of dedicated lanes for \r\nthe smooth processing of goods, especially perishable \r\nitems, to Afghanistan.\r\nMy country envisages a future of even closer \r\neconomic cooperation with Afghanistan. Pakistan \r\nhas actively promoted the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-\r\nPakistan-India gas pipeline and the Central Asia South \r\nAsia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project, which \r\nwill address the energy needs of the region and generate \r\nsignificant economic activity in Afghanistan. We are \r\nalso working with the Government of Afghanistan \r\nto explore other connectivity and infrastructure \r\ndevelopment projects. More than 50,000 Afghans \r\nhave studied in Pakistani educational institutions and \r\nare now working in Afghanistan’s public and private \r\nsectors, fulfilling their own dreams and the needs of \r\ntheir country. We have announced 3,000 scholarships \r\nfor Afghan students in Pakistani universities and \r\nprofessional colleges. The first batch of those students \r\nis already studying at various educational institutions \r\nin Pakistan. I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate Afghanistan on winning the Asian Cricket \r\nCouncil Under-19 Asia Cup.\r\nPakistan and Afghanistan share deep historical \r\nbonds of faith, culture and geography. The combined \r\npotential of the two countries is considerable. Expanded \r\ntrade, energy cooperation and implementation of \r\nthe various transregional economic projects already \r\nidentified can greatly enhance and foster peace and \r\nprosperity in the entire region.\r\nThe international community is unanimous in \r\nits view that sustainable peace in Afghanistan can be \r\nachievable only through a negotiated settlement. The \r\ndraft resolution that we will adopt today reaffirms \r\nthat international consensus. Pakistan has consistently \r\nproposed a political settlement as the most viable way \r\nto end decades of conflict and suffering in Afghanistan. \r\nSixteen years of war waged by the world’s most powerful \r\nforces have not secured a military solution. Peace will \r\nnot be restored by continuing to resort to military force. \r\nNeither the coalition supporting Kabul or the Afghan \r\nTaliban is in a position to impose a military solution \r\non the other. The promotion of a political settlement \r\nand the pursuit of a military solution in Afghanistan \r\nare mutually incompatible. Resorting to a military \r\noption without an accompanying political strategy \r\nwill not produce a result different from what we have \r\nseen over the past 16 years but will rather lead to more \r\nviolence and suffering for the Afghan people, as well as \r\nincreasing political instability in the region.\r\nIt is our sincere hope that priority will be given to \r\nachieving peace through negotiations and reconciliation. \r\nWhile the international community can help in \r\npromoting those processes, the principal responsibility \r\nfor that rests with the Afghans themselves. In that \r\nregard, we welcome the Afghan peace and reconciliation \r\nplan and hope that it will serve as a first step towards a \r\npolitical settlement. We also call on the Afghan Taliban \r\nto abandon violence, come to the negotiating table and \r\nengage in serious dialogue for peace.\r\nPakistan remains ready to help to promote such \r\na dialogue. Our participation in every regional and \r\ninternational initiative for peace and reconciliation is \r\na testament to our commitment. We have continued to \r\nengage in all processes designed to promote a political \r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 11/29\r\nsolution — the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process on \r\nRegional Security and Cooperation for a Secure and \r\nStable Afghanistan; the 6+1 group of China, India, Iran, \r\nPakistan, Russia, the United States and Afghanistan; \r\nthe International Contact Group on Afghanistan and \r\nPakistan; the Quadrilateral Coordination Group on the \r\nAfghan Peace and Reconciliation Process; the Moscow \r\nformat and the Kabul Process for Peace and Security \r\nCooperation. Progress will be assured, however, only \r\nwhen the Afghan parties themselves conclude that \r\nthere can be no military solution to the Afghan war and \r\nthat peace can be achieved only through unconditional \r\ndialogue. We hope that wisdom and realism will \r\nencourage them to engage in such peace negotiations. \r\nSuch a process is our best hope for lasting peace \r\nin Afghanistan.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that the path \r\nto peace in Afghanistan is arduous but achievable. \r\nHowever, it is up to the Afghan parties themselves to \r\nacknowledge that there is no alternative path to peace \r\nother than an unconditional dialogue and to then make \r\nthe tough but necessary compromises that will enable \r\nthem to arrive at a negotiated peace. We believe that the \r\npeople of Afghanistan deserve no less.\r\nMr. Mahmadaminov (Tajikistan): Tajikistan is pleased \r\nto join the sponsors of draft resolution A/72/L.8, which \r\nwe hope will be adopted by consensus, as in previous \r\nyears. In that regard, we express our sincere appreciation \r\nto the delegation of Germany for facilitating the draft \r\nresolution. It is encouraging that all Member States \r\nshare the same view of the importance of peace and \r\nstability in Afghanistan and its key role in promoting \r\nregional cooperation and integration. There can be no \r\ndoubt that ensuring peace, stability and socioeconomic \r\nrehabilitation for Afghanistan will be crucial to the \r\ndevelopment and prosperity of the entire region. \r\nTajikistan supports the efforts of Afghanistan and its \r\npeople aimed at strengthening its national dialogue \r\nand reconciliation and post-conflict economic \r\nrehabilitation, and calls for expanding assistance to \r\nAfghanistan targeting the restoration of its economy, \r\nthe strengthening of its social sector and the creation \r\nof new jobs. Peace, stability and urgent socioeconomic \r\nrehabilitation are crucial to Afghanistan’s development \r\nand prosperity.\r\nInvolving Afghanistan in the process of \r\nmultifaceted regional cooperation will be key to the \r\nsuccess of the international community’s efforts. \r\nWe believe that an important undertaking in that \r\nregard will be creating an environment conducive to \r\nexpanding the potential of transit networks between \r\nCentral Asian countries and Afghanistan, as well as the \r\nestablishment of the infrastructure needed to enable \r\ngoods and services to circulate freely in the region. We \r\nare ready to take part in restoring Afghanistan’s social \r\nand economic infrastructure by connecting our two \r\ncountries’ transport arteries to create an energy bridge, \r\nthe Central Asia South Asia Electricity Transmission \r\nand Trade Project (CASA-1000), which will provide \r\nthe Afghan people with essential commodities and \r\ntraining specialists. The construction of the CASA-\r\n1000 electricity transmission line, which we will \r\nimplement jointly with Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, \r\nPakistan and our development partners, will provide an \r\nenergy connection between Central and South Asia and \r\ncontribute to the future development of both regions.\r\nAnother important area for our endeavours is in \r\ncreating an environment conducive to expanding the \r\npotential of transit networks between Central Asian \r\ncountries, including Afghanistan. In that context, \r\nTajikistan believes that establishing the infrastructure \r\nnecessary for the free movement of goods, services and \r\ninvestment in the region will be crucial. We therefore \r\nconsider it a priority to achieve the signing of the \r\nrelevant documents on the utilization and construction \r\nof regional framework projects, including the trade \r\nand transit agreement between Tajikistan, Afghanistan \r\nand Pakistan and the construction of a Tajikistan-\r\nAfghanistan-Turkmenistan railway.\r\nIn that regard, by implementing national and regional \r\nprojects on energy, transport and the establishment of \r\nfree economic zones on the border with Afghanistan, \r\nTajikistan is helping to engage Afghanistan in regional \r\neconomic integration. Those projects are aimed at \r\ncreating jobs, eradicating poverty and ensuring a \r\nfavourable environment for development. Developing \r\nAfghanistan’s human resources and training specialists \r\nin various civilian professions are also important \r\npriorities for the cooperation programme between \r\nTajikistan and Afghanistan. Hundreds of Afghan students \r\nare currently studying at Tajikistan’s universities. The \r\nGovernment of Tajikistan has also established a quota of \r\n1,000 educational grants for citizens of Afghanistan for \r\nthe period ending in 2025. We will continue our efforts \r\nto further strengthen cooperation with the Government \r\nof Afghanistan and international partners on the social, \r\neconomic and security fronts in order to support \r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n12/29 17-39043\r\npeace, stability and socioeconomic development in our \r\nneighbouring countries.\r\nMr. Sinirlioğlu (Turkey): I would like to thank \r\nMr. Abdullah Abdullah, the Chief Executive of \r\nAfghanistan, for his statement and to welcome his \r\npresence at today’s debate.\r\nWe are pleased that the consultations on draft \r\nresolution A/72/L.8 on the situation of Afghanistan, \r\nwhich is before us today, have been completed \r\nsuccessfully. We thank all the delegations that made \r\ngenuine efforts to that end. The Assembly’s adoption \r\nof this resolution every year not only underscores the \r\nprogress that Afghanistan is making but is also a solid \r\nsymbol of the international community’s enduring and \r\nunanimous support to the Government and the people \r\nof Afghanistan in addressing the country’s continuing \r\nchallenges. We once again look forward to the draft \r\nresolution’s adoption by consensus, and we are pleased \r\nto be among its sponsors. I would now like to take this \r\nopportunity to share some of our views on the situation \r\nin Afghanistan.\r\nI would first like to emphasize the importance of \r\nconsolidating the country’s achievements of the past \r\n16 years. Afghanistan still needs the international \r\ncommunity’s support in that regard, and it is vital that \r\nwe live up to the commitments we have made. We must \r\nalso bear in mind that Afghan-led and -owned peace \r\nand reconciliation efforts are key to the country’s \r\nlasting peace and security. Moreover, given the fragile \r\nsecurity situation, the National Unity Government \r\nshould focus on ensuring even greater inclusiveness \r\nand on combating terrorism. Needless to say, a more \r\ninclusive approach will solidify the effects of reforms \r\nand political stability, improve the security situation \r\nand align with the international community’s efforts to \r\nachieve a stable, secure and prosperous Afghanistan.\r\nTurkey will continue to support the Afghan \r\nGovernment in realizing its security and development \r\nagenda as long as our help is needed. We will continue \r\nour bilateral assistance in the areas of security and \r\ndevelopment, and will contribute to NATO’s efforts \r\nas the Resolute Support Mission framework nation \r\nresponsible for the Kabul area. I would also like to note \r\nthat Turkey’s official development aid to Afghanistan \r\nbetween 2002 and 2016 totalled more than $1 billion and \r\nencompassed 850 projects. Our vision for Afghanistan \r\nis of a peaceful and stable country enjoying good, \r\ncooperative relations with its neighbours while being \r\nat the centre of major regional projects. In that respect, \r\nwe welcome the signing in Ashgabat on 15 November \r\nof the Lapis Lazuli transit, trade and transport \r\nroute agreement. Turkey will also continue to assist \r\nAfghanistan through multilateral platforms such as the \r\nHeart of Asia-Istanbul Process.\r\nThe Afghan people deserve a better future. Our \r\ncollective and continued commitment will help to \r\nrenew the hopes of the Afghan people as they pursue \r\nthat path. It is our joint responsibility to support and \r\nassist them to that end.\r\nMr. Lal (India): I thank the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for organizing today’s annual \r\ndebate on the situation in Afghanistan. We thank Chief \r\nExecutive Abdullah Abdullah for his presence and for \r\nthe important statement he delivered here today. His \r\nwords have clearly illustrated the indomitable spirit of \r\nthe Afghan people in even the worst adversities.\r\nDastardly acts of violence and terror targeting those \r\nwho are most vulnerable continue to test the remarkable \r\nresilience of the Afghan people. No one — not the sick \r\nin hospitals, small children in schools, worshippers \r\nin mosques or even mourners at funerals — has been \r\nspared by the dark and desperate forces of terror and \r\nviolence. We have all condemned those attacks and \r\nexpressed sympathy with the people of Afghanistan. \r\nTerrorists and their supporters, however, continue to \r\nfeel emboldened. Clearly, not enough has been done. \r\nUnfortunately, while the cowardliness and frequency \r\nof the terror attacks in Afghanistan have reached new \r\nheights, and while terrorists continue to take over \r\nterritory and resources belonging to the Afghan people, \r\nwe have witnessed little change here at the United \r\nNations. The Security Council continues to debate \r\nwhether it should designate new leaders or freeze the \r\nassets of the slain leader of the Taliban. Even as today’s \r\ndebate is taking place, Da’esh is posing new threats \r\nin Afghanistan.\r\nAddressing global terrorism requires a \r\ncomprehensive, uncompromising and coherent response \r\nfrom the international community. Afghanistan’s \r\nsecurity and stability are tied to those of the entire \r\nregion. It is imperative to address the support that \r\nterrorist organizations operating outside the fabric of \r\ninternational law — the Taliban, the Haqqani network, \r\nDa’esh, Al-Qaida and its designated affiliates, such as \r\nLashkar-e-Tayyiba and the Jaysh Muhammad — draw \r\nfrom outside Afghanistan. The special terrorist areas, \r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 13/29\r\nsafe havens and sanctuaries beyond Afghanistan’s \r\nborder must be eliminated. Support for an Afghan-led, \r\n-owned and -controlled peace and national reconciliation \r\nprocess within the framework of Afghanistan’s \r\nConstitution must be wholeheartedly pursued. Any \r\nmeaningful progress requires an end to the violence, the \r\nrenunciation of any links to international terrorism and \r\nrespect for the rights of ordinary Afghans, especially \r\nwomen and children.\r\nWe congratulate Afghanistan on its election to the \r\nHuman Rights Council for the first time. Afghanistan’s \r\nactive engagement at the United Nations on various \r\nimportant issues continues to grow. While the \r\ninternational community’s commitment to Afghanistan \r\nis renewed every year through various multilateral \r\nefforts and those of the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan, respect for Afghanistan’s \r\nsovereignty and for its direction and ownership of the \r\npeace processes should be paramount.\r\nWe are seriously concerned about the latest \r\nAfghanistan Opium Survey figures from the Afghan \r\nMinistry of Counter Narcotics and the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime highlighting the rise in \r\nopium production, the increased acreage under poppy \r\ncultivation in Afghanistan and the industry’s role in \r\nfuelling terrorism. We should be asking where those \r\ndrugs are going and who is benefiting from the trade. \r\nAccording to the survey, only a fraction of the revenue \r\ngenerated by the cultivation and trafficking of Afghan \r\nopiates reaches Afghan drug-trafficking groups. So \r\nwho controls and benefits from that nexus? Those \r\nquestions must be addressed with verifiable measures \r\nand actions. The Security Council, when addressing \r\nthe issue of the funds that terrorists in Afghanistan \r\nare generating through their illicit activities, could \r\neffectively use the sanctions regime of the Committtee \r\nestablished pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011) as \r\nleverage to promote peace. However, that has not \r\nhappened. We have not gone after the leaders of the \r\nterrorist organizations. We have not investigated or \r\nidentified the illicit drug-trafficking businesses in \r\nAfghanistan. Unless there is effective action, the \r\nUnited Nations is in danger of becoming marginalized.\r\nIndia continues to support the Government and \r\npeople of Afghanistan in their efforts to achieve a \r\nstable, secure, united, prosperous, democratic and \r\npluralistic nation. We greatly appreciate the continuing \r\nsacrifices that the Afghan security forces are making \r\nnot just for their own people, but for those in the region \r\nand the rest of the world.\r\nWe see development as the cornerstone of our \r\nlong-standing friendship with Afghanistan. The \r\nrecent high-level visits to India over the past couple of \r\nmonths, including by President Ashraf Ghani and Chief \r\nExecutive Abdullah Abdullah, have given momentum to \r\nthe next generation of the new development partnership \r\nbetween us, launched in September. That extends to \r\na whole range of areas, including education, health, \r\nagriculture, infrastructure, renewable energy, drinking-\r\nwater supplies and human-resource development.\r\nThe importance of connectivity and transit in \r\nbringing peace and prosperity to Afghanistan is clear \r\nto us all. Regrettably, normal overland transport and \r\ntransit access between India and Afghanistan has been \r\nblocked for many years, a blockade that harms the \r\npeople of Afghanistan, for it is their welfare that is \r\naffected the most. In June, we established an air-freight \r\ncorridor designed to give Afghan farmers direct access \r\nto Indian markets. Three dozen cargo f lights from \r\nKabul and Kandahar have already arrived in New Delhi. \r\nTen days ago, on 11 November, the first consignment of \r\nwheat-grain assistance from India reached Afghanistan \r\nthrough the Iranian port of Chabahar. We believe this \r\nmarks the beginning of a new era of enhanced, reliable \r\nand robust connectivity for landlocked Afghanistan \r\nthat will enable it to trade with the larger economies \r\nin South Asia and beyond. The September India-\r\nAfghanistan trade and investment show in New Delhi \r\ngenerated more than $250 million worth of business \r\nand demonstrated where the natural f low of trade and \r\ncommerce lies for Afghanistan.\r\nWe will welcome the Assembly’s adoption of draft \r\nresolution A/72/L.8, on the situation in Afghanistan, \r\nand hope that it will lead to a sharper focus on what \r\nreally ails Afghanistan. It is time to abandon our \r\nroutine discussions of the situation in Afghanistan and \r\ndeal with the core issues. We should start by paying \r\ngreater attention to the voices of Afghans.\r\nMr. Khoshroo (Islamic Republic of Iran): I \r\nwelcome the participation of Mr. Abdullah Abdullah, \r\nChief Executive of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, \r\nin our meeting. Let me start by reaffirming the resolve \r\nof the people and the Government of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran to continue their support to the \r\nfraternal people and the Government of Afghanistan as \r\nthey navigate this difficult period in their quest for a \r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n14/29 17-39043\r\nstable, safe and prosperous Afghanistan. I hope that the \r\nAssembly’s adoption today of draft resolution A/72/L.8 \r\nwill contribute to that goal.\r\nOur region continues to suffer from an alarming \r\nsurge in extremist violence, and a dramatic increase \r\nin drug production is threatening our societies. \r\nUnfortunately, Afghanistan is one of the countries most \r\naffected by such problems. The upward trend in the \r\nlevels of violence and the number of terrorist attacks has \r\ncontinued year after year since the United States invaded \r\nAfghanistan in 2001. More than a decade later, neither \r\nAfghanistan, the region or the world is any safer. The \r\ndeteriorating security situation in Afghanistan has deep \r\nroots and cannot be addressed solely through military \r\nstrategies. The Afghan Government of National Unity \r\nis now at the forefront of fighting terrorism and needs \r\nthe international community’s sustained support more \r\nthan ever in its fight against terrorism and extremism, \r\nas well as in facing its complex security, economic and \r\ndevelopment challenges. Iran reiterates its support for \r\nany Afghan-led peace process.\r\nStrengthening our regional cooperation with \r\nAfghanistan is a priority and a major step in the \r\nconsolidation of peace and development in the region. \r\nWe welcome and urge for further efforts to strengthen \r\nthe process of regional economic cooperation, \r\nincluding measures aimed at facilitating regional \r\nconnectivity, trade and transit, as highlighted in today’s \r\ndraft resolution. In that regard, the recent start of the \r\nChabahar project and the arrival of the first shipment \r\nfrom India to Afghanistan through that port represent \r\nimportant progress.\r\nThe challenges facing Afghanistan and our region \r\nare interconnected. We are very concerned about \r\nthe findings of the Afghanistan Opium Survey 2017 \r\nof the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime, \r\nwhich indicates that opium production grew by \r\n87 per cent in the course of the year, numbers that are \r\nespecially alarming in view of the fact that narcotics \r\nare a major source of income for terrorist groups. \r\nUnderdevelopment, low incomes and lack of economic \r\nopportunities provide fertile ground and abundant \r\nrecruitment opportunities for terrorist groups and drug \r\nnetworks. The international community must support \r\nthe relevant international and regional projects and \r\nactivities, including those conducted by Afghanistan, \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan within \r\nthe framework of their triangular counter-narcotics \r\ninitiative. For more than three decades, Iran has hosted \r\nmillions of Afghan refugees sharing our public services \r\nand education. This year alone, our schools are educating \r\nnearly 400,000 undocumented Afghan students.\r\nIran continues to participate in the work of the \r\nTripartite Commission in order to plan for the voluntary, \r\nsafe, dignified and gradual repatriation of Afghan \r\nrefugees. However, the number of returnees continues \r\nto be the lowest recorded since the establishment in \r\n2002 of the voluntary return programme, with many \r\nreturnees choosing not to return to their areas of origin, \r\nincluding large numbers who have settled in urban \r\ncentres. We welcome any effort to help overcome the \r\nmain challenges to reintegration that returnees face and \r\nto formulate a comprehensive voluntary repatriation \r\nand reintegration strategy. Success in voluntary \r\nrepatriation depends first and foremost on meeting the \r\nreasonable needs of repatriated refugees in Afghanistan \r\nand underscores the importance of mobilizing more \r\ninternational support to that end. A stronger and more \r\ncoordinated approach among the Government, donors \r\nand the United Nations, and an overall strategy for \r\naddressing the combined needs of the displaced and \r\nreturnees will be crucial to ensuring that the repatriation \r\nof Afghan refugees is more effective.\r\nWe support the United Nations Assistance Mission \r\nin Afghanistan (UNAMA) and other United Nations \r\nagencies in their efforts to provide development \r\nand reconstruction assistance through the genuine \r\ncommitment of the United Nations to a sustained \r\npartnership with Afghanistan, as outlined in the final \r\nreport (S/2015/713, annex) of the Tripartite Review \r\nCommission on the United Nations in Afghanistan. \r\nWe must utilize the mandate of UNAMA and its good \r\noffices to strengthen national institutions and capacities \r\nin priority areas, as the Government requests.\r\nMr. Blanchard (Canada): I would like to thank \r\nGermany for leading the preparation of this year’s draft \r\nresolution (A/72/L.8), on the situation in Afghanistan. \r\nOn behalf of Canada, I would also like to express \r\nour appreciation for the presence and statement \r\nin the Assembly today of Chief Executive Officer \r\nAbdullah Abdullah.\r\nCanada remains steadfast in its desire for peace \r\nand security in Afghanistan. The fighting there has \r\nintensified, and we are dismayed by the unacceptable \r\ntoll it is taking on the Afghan people. We hope that all \r\ndomestic, regional and international stakeholders will \r\ncontinue to focus on bringing an end to that violence. \r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 15/29\r\nFor our part, we remain committed to ensuring that \r\nAfghanistan does not once again become a haven for \r\ninternational terrorism. We are dedicated to helping \r\nAfghans create a sustainable future and a country \r\nthat is well governed, respects human rights and is in \r\ncontrol of its own destiny.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada fully supports the Afghan-led peace and \r\nreconciliation process and commends the Government \r\nof Afghanistan for its efforts to foster peace, including \r\nby convening the first conference of the Kabul Process \r\nfor Peace and Security Cooperation in June. The Kabul \r\nProcess meeting, held shortly after the devastating \r\nattack of 31 May in Kabul, is only one example of the \r\ncountry’s unwavering commitment to peace, despite \r\nformidable challenges. Canada also welcomes the \r\nimportant role played by so many States and civil-\r\nsociety actors in promoting peace and reconciliation \r\nin Afghanistan, and in particular the tireless efforts of \r\nthose working to help those who are most vulnerable, \r\nespecially the internally displaced, refugees, minority \r\ncommunities and women and girls.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAs Mr. Abdullah reminded us this morning, it is \r\nurgent and important that we, the States Members of \r\nthe United Nations, support our Secretary-General in \r\nhis efforts to reform the United Nations with a view to \r\nensuring our ability to make the United Nations “deliver \r\nas one” in Afghanistan as soon as possible. For us in the \r\nOrganization, the discussions of United Nations reform \r\nmay sometimes sound bureaucratic and theoretical. \r\nBut for the people of Afghanistan, that reform process \r\ncould not be more real.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada has pledged $465 million in security-sector \r\nsupport and development assistance to Afghanistan for \r\nthe period from 2017 to 2020. At its core is a special \r\nfocus on the rights of women and girls in line with \r\nCanada’s feminist foreign policy, as well as with our \r\nsecond national action plan on women, peace and \r\nsecurity commitments.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nSustainable peace and security cannot be achieved \r\nwithout the active and substantive participation of \r\nall members of society, including women and girls. \r\nWe are pleased to see the commitment in today’s \r\ndraft resolution to achieving women’s full and equal \r\nparticipation in all spheres of Afghan life. Women play \r\na vital role in the peace process, and we echo the draft \r\nresolution in emphasizing the importance of respect for \r\nthe rule of law and human rights in Afghanistan.\r\nNor can sustainable peace and security be \r\nachieved without economic development. I was \r\nhappy to hear Chief Executive Abdullah say that the \r\neconomy has turned a corner and is showing signs of \r\nrecovery, especially in private-sector investment and \r\ndevelopment. Canada is pleased to hear that the regional \r\neconomic cooperation agenda is becoming a reality and \r\nstands ready to provide it with further assistance. As \r\nmy colleague from Tajikistan said, regional economic \r\ncooperation is one of the keys to stability in the region.\r\nAs we move forward on the draft resolution, I \r\nwould like to note that this year marks the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition \r\nof the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of \r\nAnti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. The \r\nuse of anti-personnel landmines and the numbers of \r\ntheir victims are dropping around the world. I hope that \r\nsuch achievements will continue to motivate us all in \r\nour efforts to attain peace, emphasizing the importance \r\nof sustained international assistance as we work towards \r\nthe goal of declaring Afghanistan mine-free by 2023.\r\nCanada supports draft resolution A/72/L.8. We \r\nstand with the Afghan people, especially the country’s \r\nwomen and girls, as they strive for a more secure, \r\nprosperous and peaceful future.\r\nMr. Ibragimov (Uzbekistan): I would like to thank \r\nthe President for convening today’s important meeting \r\non the situation in Afghanistan and to make a general \r\nstatement on draft resolution A/72/L.8 in the context of \r\nits implications for the Central Asian region.\r\nToday the prospects for stable and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Central Asia are inextricably linked to \r\nthe achievement of peace in our neighbour Afghanistan, \r\nsince stabilizing the situation there is an important \r\nprerequisite for ensuring peace and security globally as \r\nwell as regionally. In that regard, Uzbekistan supports \r\nthe draft resolution on the situation in Afghanistan, \r\nwhich defines the progress that has been achieved and the \r\ncontinuing challenges facing the country, and provides \r\nways to address those challenges. We particularly agree \r\nwith the notion that there is no military solution that \r\ncan ensure Afghanistan’s stability, which requires \r\nall the country’s regional and international partners \r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n16/29 17-39043\r\nto continue their efforts to support the peace and \r\nreconciliation process. As the draft resolution states, \r\nan inclusive Afghan-led and -owned peace process \r\nbacked by the international community is essential to \r\nachieving long-term peace and stability there. That also \r\nreflects Uzbekistan’s position on the issue. As President \r\nShavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan said in his address \r\nto the Assembly at its seventy-second session,\r\n“We are convinced that the only way to peace \r\nin Afghanistan is a direct dialogue between \r\nthe central Government and the main domestic \r\npolitical forces, held without preconditions. The \r\nnegotiations should be Afghan-led, held on the \r\nterritory of Afghanistan and under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations.” (A/72/PV.5, p.15)\r\nUzbekistan strongly believes that the international \r\ncommunity’s active involvement in helping Afghanistan \r\nto rebuild its economy and infrastructure continues \r\nto be an important condition for ensuring the overall \r\nstabilization of the situation there. Those efforts \r\nshould focus on integrating Afghanistan into regional \r\neconomic processes, especially projects implemented by \r\nits neighbours in energy and transport communication \r\nand other areas.\r\nTen days ago, Uzbekistan hosted an international \r\nconference, held under the auspices of the United \r\nNations, on ensuring security and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Central Asia. Foreign Ministers from \r\nevery Central Asian State, including Afghanistan, as \r\nwell as high-ranking officials from other countries, \r\nthe European Union, the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe and various international \r\norganizations, were present at the forum and \r\ncontributed to its success. In the forum’s final \r\ncommuniqué, the attendees supported initiatives aimed \r\nat backing the peace process in Afghanistan, promoting \r\nthe reconstruction of its socioeconomic infrastructure \r\nand working more actively to integrate it into global \r\neconomic networks.\r\nOver the past year, Uzbekistan has also intensified \r\nits bilateral dialogue with Afghanistan. This year alone, \r\nthe Presidents of the two countries met several times on \r\nthe sidelines of various international conferences and \r\nforums. An official visit by Afghanistan’s President \r\nto Uzbekistan is also being planned. In January, \r\na delegation from Uzbekistan, led by our Foreign \r\nMinister, paid an official visit to Kabul, during which \r\nthe parties signed five agreements on collaborating on \r\nAfghanistan’s economic reconstruction, developing \r\nits transport and energy infrastructure and training \r\nits human resources. It was also announced that an \r\nUzbekistan trade commission would open in Kabul \r\nwith the goal of expanding trade between the two \r\ncountries. In addition, this year the President of \r\nUzbekistan appointed a special envoy to Afghanistan \r\nin a clear indication of Uzbekistan’s desire to upgrade \r\nits bilateral ties to a qualitatively new level and advance \r\nits multifaceted cooperation with Afghanistan on \r\nevery front.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that we in \r\nUzbekistan strongly believe that Afghanistan must \r\nremain at the heart of the global agenda. Its integration \r\ninto regional and global economic networks will \r\nbe a key factor in establishing peace and stability in \r\nthe country.\r\nMr. Camp (United States of America): I would \r\nlike to start by thanking the German delegation for its \r\nwork in leading the negotiations on this year’s draft \r\nresolution (A/72/L.8). I am also grateful to Afghanistan \r\nand all the other nations that engaged constructively \r\non the text, as well to Mr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chief \r\nExecutive of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, for \r\nhis presence here today.\r\nThe United States is pleased to be a sponsor of \r\nthe draft resolution and thereby renew its collective \r\npledge of continued support to the Government and the \r\npeople of Afghanistan as they work to build a stable, \r\nprosperous and secure nation. It has been 16 years since \r\nthe United States and the international community first \r\ntook action in Afghanistan. Throughout that period, \r\nwe and our international partners have expended \r\nconsiderable blood and treasure, and the Afghan people \r\nhave endured great hardship and sacrifice. We were \r\nreminded of that in the starkest terms this year on \r\n31 May, when terrorists killed more than 150 people \r\nand injured almost 500 in a cowardly attack in the \r\ncentre of Kabul. Among the dead, almost all of them \r\ncivilians, were women, children, members of the media \r\nand diplomatic personnel.\r\nIn the first half of this year, the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan documented more \r\nthan 5,200 civilian casualties, of which more than \r\n1,600 were fatalities. Even more tragically, 30 per cent \r\nof those were children. As the draft resolution notes, \r\nanti-Government forces such as the Taliban, along with \r\nterrorist groups such as Al-Qaida and the Islamic State \r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 17/29\r\nin Iraq and the Sham in Khorasan, were responsible for \r\na significant majority of those civilian casualties. It was \r\nin that context that in August President Trump approved \r\na new regional strategy for the United States in South \r\nAsia, based on the recognition that Afghanistan’s \r\nsecurity and stability is tied to that of the entire region, \r\nand that we must enlist that region in efforts to bring \r\npeace to Afghanistan. We will continue to support the \r\nAfghan Government and security forces in their fight \r\nagainst the Taliban and terrorist groups. We commend \r\nthe Afghan Government on the progress it has made \r\nin combating those threats, and we are prepared to \r\nassist its forces in ending the war and preventing the \r\nre-establishment of any terrorist safe haven.\r\nOur NATO allies and partners are working \r\nto finalize troop increases and additional support \r\nefforts that will strengthen NATO’s Resolute Support \r\nMission. At the NATO Defence Ministers’ meeting \r\non 9 November, more than two dozen nations stated \r\nthat they intend to increase their troop numbers on the \r\nground. We are deeply appreciative of their continued \r\ncommitment to stabilizing Afghanistan and the broader \r\nSouth Asia region. All of the efforts of the United States \r\nand our NATO allies in Afghanistan are focused on the \r\ngoal of achieving a political settlement via an Afghan-\r\nled and -owned inclusive peace process. Today’s draft \r\nresolution underscores how important it is to ensure \r\nthat such a peace process is backed by all the relevant \r\nregional actors, and we urge both Afghans and regional \r\npartners to bring a renewed sense of urgency in order to \r\nreinvigorate the peace talks.\r\nOur message to the Taliban and other \r\nanti-Government forces is clear. They cannot win on \r\nthe battlefield, and the only path to peace is through \r\nnegotiations. They must cut their ties with terrorist \r\ngroups, abandon violence and accept the Afghan \r\nConstitution. Along with our efforts to advance \r\nAfghanistan’s peace process, we stand ready to work \r\nwith President Ghani, Chief Executive Abdullah, the \r\nAfghan Government and the Afghan people to advance \r\nsecurity, political stability, electoral reform and \r\naccountable governance in the coming year. Working \r\ntogether, the Afghan Government, the region and \r\nAfghanistan’s international partners can make progress \r\ntowards the promise of a stable, secure and prosperous \r\nAfghanistan. Indeed, we owe it to the soldiers and \r\ncivilians who have suffered or perished during the \r\ncourse of the war to make good that promise.\r\nMr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): China \r\nwould like to welcome Mr. Abdullah Abdullah, the \r\nChief Executive of Afghanistan, to our debate today.\r\nAfghanistan’s peace and stability are central to the \r\ninterests of the Afghan people and have a bearing on \r\nregional security, stability, development and prosperity. \r\nA united, stable and growing Afghanistan will serve \r\nthe common interests of the international community \r\nand the countries in the region. China commends the \r\nNational Unity Government for its commitment to \r\neconomic and social development and the promotion of \r\nnational reconciliation, as well as the positive results it \r\nhas achieved. In the meantime, however, Afghanistan \r\nis still facing serious political, economic and security \r\nchallenges. China hopes the international community \r\nwill continue its support and assistance to Afghanistan \r\nto help it realize peace, stability and development. In \r\nthat regard, we would like to propose the following \r\nkey initiatives.\r\nFirst, peace and stability must be maintained by \r\nimproving the security environment. The Afghan \r\nNational Defence and Security Forces bear the primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of peace, security and \r\nstability in Afghanistan. The international community \r\nshould continue to support their capacity-building \r\ninitiatives so as to effectively respond to threats such \r\nas terrorism, transnational crime and drug trafficking. \r\nDraft resolution A/72/L.8 acknowledges the important \r\ncontribution made by regional organizations such as the \r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization to the maintenance \r\nof security and stability in Afghanistan and hopes \r\nthat the international community can strengthen \r\ncounter-terrorism, coordination and cooperation so \r\nas to provide a secure environment for Afghanistan’s \r\nnational development and reconstruction.\r\nSecondly, determined efforts must be made to \r\nadvance the reconciliation process through political \r\ndialogue. Advancing an inclusive reconciliation process, \r\nled and owned by the Afghan people, is the only way \r\nto lasting peace and development in Afghanistan. The \r\nparties should put the long-term interests of the country \r\nand the people first and participate actively in the \r\npolitical reconciliation process based on the strategic \r\nplan for peace and reconciliation. China supports the \r\nQuadrilateral Coordination Group on the Afghan peace \r\nand reconciliation process, through which Afghanistan, \r\nChina, Pakistan and the United States should continue \r\ntheir activities, in accordance with resolution 72/10, \r\nto push for launching peace talks between the Afghan \r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n18/29 17-39043\r\nGovernment and the Taliban as soon as possible. We \r\nwelcome the international community’s continued \r\nsupport to peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan.\r\nThirdly, reconstruction must be realized through \r\nindependent development. China hopes that the political \r\nparties in Afghanistan can improve their unity, narrow \r\ntheir differences through dialogue and work jointly for \r\nnational development in accordance with the Afghanistan \r\nNational Peace and Development Framework. The \r\ninternational community should continue to provide \r\nthe Afghan Government and people with attention and \r\nsupport — while respecting Afghanistan’s sovereignty, \r\nindependence and territorial integrity and the Afghan \r\npeople’s right to an independent choice of political \r\nsystems and development paths — and, by taking \r\nAfghanistan’s development strategies and specific \r\nneeds into consideration, target its assistance so as to \r\nhelp the Afghan Government improve its governance \r\nand development capabilities.\r\nFourthly, in order to support economic and \r\nsocial development through regional cooperation, \r\nthe international community should honour its aid \r\ncommitments to Afghanistan and support its efforts \r\nto achieve economic sustainability. Afghanistan is \r\nblessed with the advantage of significant geological \r\nand other natural resources, and has broad potential for \r\nparticipating in regional economic cooperation. The \r\ndraft resolution once again underscores the importance \r\nof initiatives such as One Belt One Road in promoting \r\nAfghanistan’s economic development and regional \r\ncooperation. We hope that in a spirit of consultation, \r\ncollaboration and benefit-sharing, countries can \r\nstrengthen their regional economic cooperation and \r\ninterconnectivity, and help Afghanistan integrate into \r\nregional development with a view to forging a shared \r\ndestiny for humankind.\r\nAs Afghanistan’s good neighbour and good \r\npartner, China has all along supported Afghanistan’s \r\nreconstruction and development efforts. Countries in \r\nthe region, including Afghanistan, took an active part in \r\nthe Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, \r\nheld in Beijing in May. The Governments of China and \r\nAfghanistan have signed cooperation agreements in \r\neconomic, trade and customs affairs and other spheres, \r\nand are actively implementing the memorandum of \r\nunderstanding between China and Afghanistan and \r\njointly promoting the Belt and Road construction.\r\nThose efforts will further strengthen trade and \r\ninfrastructure interconnectivity between Afghanistan \r\nand the region and will help to consolidate economic \r\nand social development in Afghanistan and the \r\nregion. China stands ready, along with the rest of \r\nthe international community, to make unremitting \r\nefforts for the early realization of peace, stability and \r\ndevelopment in Afghanistan.\r\nChina supports the unanimous adoption of draft \r\nresolution A/72/L.8, on Afghanistan, by the General \r\nAssembly at the current session and commends \r\nGermany for its tremendous efforts as the facilitator of \r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nMrs. Nusseibeh (United Arab Emirates): At the \r\noutset, I would like to say that the United Arab Emirates \r\nlooks forward to the adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/72/L.8, on the situation in Afghanistan, by the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and thanks Germany for its great \r\nwork in facilitating the draft resolution. Mobilizing \r\nsupport for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is the \r\nway to create a safe and sustainable path that ensures \r\ninclusive and long-term development for all Afghans. I \r\ntherefore welcome the statement made this morning by \r\nMr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chief Executive of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan, which offered an important \r\nblueprint for Afghanistan’s future.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has been devoted to \r\nimproving the lives of the Afghan people for more than \r\nfour decades. We believe that that is not only the right \r\nthing to do, but that it is imperative for maintaining the \r\nsecurity and stability of our region. We recognize the \r\nneed to achieve long-term peace and stability through \r\na comprehensive Afghan-led political peace process. In \r\nthat regard, we commend the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and those of his Special Representative \r\nin the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan for their role in improving coherence and \r\ninternational coordination in support of an Afghan-led \r\npolitical process.\r\nThe Afghan Government and people are on the \r\nfront lines of the global war against terrorism and \r\nextremism. The United Arab Emirates is gravely \r\nconcerned by the tragic events that have occurred in \r\nAfghanistan in recent years, including the escalating \r\nnumber of terrorist attacks targeting civilians and \r\nsecurity forces. One such attack earlier this year really \r\nstruck home for us. A heinous act of violence claimed \r\nthe life of my colleague, Mr. Juma Al-Kaabi, the United \r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 19/29\r\nArab Emirates Ambassador to Kabul, and killed five \r\nother Emirati diplomats and 11 Afghans, injuring \r\nmany more.\r\nWe know that we are not alone in our concern \r\nabout that situation. The United States and dozens of \r\nother countries are actively addressing the insecurity \r\nin Afghanistan and have been for years. We applaud \r\nthe efforts of the United States, the European Union, \r\nthe NATO partners and others to bring peace and \r\nstability to the country and to support and rebuild its \r\ninstitutions and infrastructure. We welcome the United \r\nStates Administration’s bold strategy, which brings \r\nrenewed vigour to addressing the security situation \r\nand is charting a path of continued United States \r\nengagement aimed at improving the conditions on the \r\nground in Afghanistan.\r\nWhile much progress has been made, the road \r\nahead is long. The international community must not \r\nrepeat the mistakes of the past, when disengagement \r\nand neglect of Afghanistan permitted extremists to \r\ntake over the country. We call on the international \r\ncommunity to continue to address the security situation \r\nin Afghanistan, work to establish a peace process, \r\nintensify efforts to support the country’s security forces \r\nand promote economic and human development.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has been a long-term \r\nstakeholder in the international community’ efforts \r\nto ensure the peace and prosperity of Afghanistan. In \r\nsupport of the legitimate Government of Afghanistan \r\nand our NATO partners, the United Arab Emirates \r\nhas been part of the International Security Assistance \r\nForce mission in the country since 2003. Emirati \r\ntroops — who have numbered as many as 1,500 — have \r\nprovided security assistance and have been involved \r\nin community development activities. We welcome \r\nMr. Abdullah’s statement this morning that defeating \r\nterrorism is a cornerstone of their security strategy. \r\nWe believe, along with him, that it is action against all \r\nforms of terrorism that will speak louder than words. \r\nWe must agree to fight all shades of terrorism. There \r\nare no good or bad terrorists.\r\nSince the 1970s, the United Arab Emirates has \r\nprovided over $680 million in development assistance \r\nfor reconstruction and for humanitarian efforts. My \r\ncountry has implemented several development and \r\nreconstruction projects in Afghanistan, including \r\na housing and community development project in \r\nKabul, the rebuilding of the airport in Mazar-e-Sharif \r\nin collaboration with Germany and other countries, \r\nand a partnership with the United Kingdom on work \r\nto improve Highway 611, a critical traffic artery in \r\nthe country.\r\nAnd because we also believe that educational \r\ninstitutions — especially in conflict-affected \r\nareas — are instrumental in building a future for \r\nyoung generations, the United Arab Emirates opened \r\nthe Zayed University in Khost province, which teaches \r\nmedicine, engineering, technology and law, among \r\nother subjects.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates also recognizes that \r\nreligious leaders are integral to instilling values of \r\npeace, tolerance and diversity. To that end, the United \r\nArab Emirates aims to train religious leaders and \r\nposition them to better lead their communities. We \r\nhave trained nearly 20,000 Afghan imams to promote \r\nvalues of tolerance and moderation in Islam, work to \r\neliminate causes of discord and division, foster peace \r\nand promote inclusion.\r\nIn establishing peace and security in Afghanistan, \r\nwe must not forget the fundamental and important \r\nrole that women play. To that end, we recall Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000) and the subsequent \r\nresolutions on women and peace and security that make \r\nup the framework for the integration of women into \r\nthe building of sustainable and inclusive societies. To \r\nbetter position women in Afghan society, the United \r\nArab Emirates has specifically implemented projects \r\nfor women and families in Afghanistan, including \r\nthrough their ownership of small businesses, so as to \r\nenable them to provide for their families.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to say that the United Arab \r\nEmirates remains deeply committed to the people of \r\nAfghanistan. The relationship between the United Arab \r\nEmirates and the Afghan people is a particularly close \r\none. We are powerfully bonded by our shared history, \r\ntraditions and culture. The United Arab Emirates will \r\ntherefore continue to provide humanitarian support and \r\ndevelopment assistance, particularly in health, education \r\nand social services, through bilateral cooperation or \r\njoint cooperation with international partners.\r\nMr. Imnadze (Georgia): Georgia aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the observer of the European \r\nUnion. However, I would like to make few remarks in \r\nmy national capacity.\r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n20/29 17-39043\r\nAt the outset, allow me to thank the delegation \r\nof Germany for facilitating the negotiations on \r\ndraft resolution A/72/L.8, entitled “The situation in \r\nAfghanistan”, this year again. As one of the sponsors of \r\nthe draft resolution, we look forward to its adoption by \r\nconsensus later today.\r\nThe United Nations plays a central role in \r\npromoting peace and stability in Afghanistan. We \r\nremain committed to the development of Afghanistan \r\nand commend the efforts of its Government aimed at \r\nreconstruction, development and strengthening the \r\nfoundations of democracy. We condemn in the strongest \r\nterms all unlawful acts of violence and intimidation \r\nperpetrated against civilians, which are aimed at \r\nundermining those efforts.\r\nGeorgia is privileged to be among those countries \r\nthat are helping Afghanistan rebuild that war-torn \r\ncountry. Despite our small size and our own security \r\nchallenges related to respect for our territorial integrity \r\nand sovereignty, Georgia has, for more than a decade, \r\nbeen consistently contributing to the international \r\nefforts aimed at ensuring the secure and peaceful \r\ndevelopment of Afghanistan.\r\nThroughout those years, in a clear demonstration \r\nof my country’s commitment to enhancing peace and \r\nstability in the region, Georgian soldiers have been \r\npart of the NATO missions in Afghanistan, displaying \r\noutstanding courage, professionalism and dedication. \r\nWe joined the anti-terrorist coalition immediately after \r\nthe horrendous 9/11 attacks by providing our airspace \r\nand airports for the transit of coalition forces and \r\npersonnel to Afghanistan. In 2004, Georgia upgraded \r\nits engagement by committing troops, and within \r\nseveral years it became the largest non-NATO troop \r\ncontributor to the International Security Assistance \r\nForce (ISAF), and the second largest per capita \r\ntroop contributor after the United States. Following \r\nthe drawdown of ISAF, Georgia maintained its \r\ncommitment to international peace and security by \r\njoining the Resolute Support Mission. We maintain \r\n870 servicemen and servicewomen, and stand ready \r\nto maintain the same volume and composition of those \r\nforces throughout 2018.\r\nWe also support the development of the Afghan \r\nNational Defence and Security Forces and have already \r\ncontributed $1.5 million to the Afghan National \r\nArmy Trust Fund. We will consider further financial \r\ncontributions for the period 2018-2020.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to welcome the Chief \r\nExecutive of Afghanistan, Mr. Abdullah Abdullah. \r\nWe welcome his statement and echo his remarks on \r\nthe Lapis Lazuli Corridor, in which Afghanistan, \r\nTurkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey joined \r\nhands in a historic agreement, once again reaffirming \r\ntheir centuries-old traditional, cultural and economic \r\nties. The Corridor not only opens up new opportunities \r\nfor the development of Afghanistan and the entire region \r\nbut also acts as a stabilizing factor in terms of security.\r\nGeorgia will continue to stand by Afghanistan and \r\nits people in the years to come.\r\nMs. Plepytė (Lithuania): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank the delegation of Germany for its outstanding \r\nwork on the draft resolution on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan (A/72/L.8), which Lithuania co-sponsored.\r\nLithuania aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\non behalf of the European Union. We welcome the \r\nparticipation of, and the statement made by, the Chief \r\nExecutive of Afghanistan, Mr. Abdullah Abdullah, at \r\nthis meeting.\r\nLithuania commends the National Unity Government \r\nof Afghanistan for implementing substantial reforms in \r\nvarious areas, with a view to facilitating the transition \r\nof the country into a peaceful and democratic society. \r\nThe efforts in the fight against corruption and impunity \r\nare encouraging. However, further progress is needed \r\nin the areas of democracy, the rule of law, human rights \r\nand women’s empowerment. But first and foremost, \r\nnone of the goals can be achieved without a stable \r\nsecurity situation, which is vital for the development \r\nof the nation.\r\nAs the Secretary-General indicates in his most \r\nrecent report (A/72/392), conflict continues throughout \r\nthe country, with thousands of civilians killed or \r\ninjured, and hundreds of thousands displaced. Ordinary \r\nAfghans bear the brunt as armed clashes, improvised \r\nexplosive devices, suicide attacks and assassinations \r\ncontinue unabated. The growing number of casualties \r\namong women and children is an extremely worrying \r\nfact. Terrorist attacks continue to destabilize the \r\ncountry, with the Taliban, Al-Qaida, the Islamic State \r\nin Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan Province and others \r\nclaiming responsibility for the most brutal ones.\r\nThe cycle of violence must end, and dialogue \r\ncommence. Peace can be achieved only through direct \r\nnegotiations, and we encourage the Government of \r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 21/29\r\nAfghanistan and the Taliban to proceed in that regard. \r\nOnly the fostering of stable and effective institutions \r\nof Government that can overcome the threats from \r\nIslamist terrorist groups active in the country can \r\nlead to success. The leaders of Afghanistan must \r\nultimately assume responsibility in order to achieve \r\nlong-term peace and stability in the country. Only \r\nan Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process can \r\nensure sustainable solutions in the various fields of the \r\ndevelopment of the State.\r\nWhile commending the Afghan National Defence \r\nand Security Forces for their courage and resilience in \r\nmaintaining full responsibility for security throughout \r\nthe country, we also stress that they must continue \r\nto be strengthened. One of the contributions of the \r\ninternational community to that end is represented by \r\nthe Resolute Support Mission, which provides training, \r\nadvice and assistance. Lithuania, for its part, continues \r\nto assist Afghanistan in building professionally trained \r\nand equipped defence and security forces. This year \r\nagain, we contributed $500,000 to the Afghanistan \r\nNational Army Trust Fund and intend to do likewise \r\nover the coming years. We have also increased our \r\nmilitary presence, within the framework of the Resolute \r\nSupport Mission.\r\nElectoral reform should remain high on the national \r\nagenda. As Afghanistan prepares for the forthcoming \r\nparliamentary and district-council elections next year, \r\nwe hope that every effort will be made to hold them in \r\na timely, inclusive, transparent and credible manner. It \r\nis imperative that no political divisions destabilize the \r\nsituation, so that timely elections can herald tangible \r\nprogress towards the democratization of the country.\r\nIn the context of the forthcoming elections, we \r\nexpect that the reintroduction of the 25 per cent \r\nquota for women in the Parliament will provide \r\nmuch-needed impetus to efforts to secure women’s \r\nrights in Afghanistan. Although we acknowledge \r\nthe progress achieved on Afghan women’s rights and \r\nempowerment, advances in promoting women’s rights \r\nremain, nevertheless, uneven. A new Women, Peace \r\nand Security Index, unveiled recently at the United \r\nNations, indicates that Afghan women’s inclusion and \r\naccess to justice and security in the home, community \r\nand society remain the lowest among all countries on \r\nthe list.\r\nIn that regard, we congratulate Afghanistan’s first \r\ntelevision network run by and for women, Zan TV, \r\nand female Afghan journalists, who are challenging, \r\nthrough several new media projects, various stereotypes \r\nimposed on them in their society. The network, which \r\ncovers topics from women’s rights to children’s shows, \r\nis set to transform attitudes in the country and should \r\nbe supported.\r\nAt the same time, we are concerned about the \r\nsituation of journalists and media workers, who face \r\nincreasing risks in their daily lives. This year marked \r\nan increase in attacks on journalists and media outlets. \r\nWe encourage the Afghan authorities to strengthen \r\ntheir efforts to investigate attacks against journalists \r\nand related media workers and bring the perpetrators \r\nto account.\r\nThe growing problem of widespread drug \r\nproduction in the country has a very negative impact \r\non development, health and security. Concerted efforts \r\non the part of the Government of Afghanistan and \r\nthe international community are required to generate \r\nalternative sources of income, create viable economic \r\nopportunities and jobs, and foster a business-friendly \r\nenvironment. Such an approach would enhance the \r\nprospects of the population and, at the same time, \r\nreduce migration out of Afghanistan.\r\nIn conclusion, Lithuania continues to support the \r\nefforts of the Afghan people to achieve lasting peace \r\nand prosperity. Lithuanian companies are working \r\nwith Afghanistan to improve the quality of Afghan \r\npassports and solve cybersecurity issues. Moreover, \r\nour State institutions stand ready to assist with the \r\nreform processes and share our experience in a number \r\nof areas. A stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan \r\nis a priority that we share, in the interests of all of us.\r\nMr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke \r\nin French): At the outset, I should like to join other \r\nspeakers in thanking Mr. Abdullah Abdullah for his \r\nstatement. I should also like to thank our German \r\ncolleagues for having so ably guided the negotiations \r\non today’s draft resolution (A/72/L.8). We hope that it \r\nwill be adopted by consensus, as in previous years.\r\nBelgium aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\non behalf of the European Union. I should like to add \r\nthe following remarks in my national capacity.\r\nOver the past decade, Afghanistan has made \r\nsignificant progress politically, economically and in \r\nterms of development. The draft resolution highlights \r\nnumerous areas of progress, but those gains are fragile, \r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n22/29 17-39043\r\nand major challenges persist. I should like to focus on \r\nfour aspects.\r\nFirst, I would like to underscore that the draft \r\nresolution provides a unique opportunity for the \r\ninternational community to come together to consider \r\nthe best way to assist Afghanistan in building sustainable \r\npeace and development. There are many ways to \r\nsupport the country, including cooperation on security, \r\nregional trade and humanitarian matters, strengthening \r\ninstitutions and fighting drug trafficking, criminality, \r\nterrorism and human rights violations, among many \r\nothers. Providing such support in coordination with the \r\nefforts undertaken by Afghanistan brings us closer to \r\nlasting peace.\r\nFor its part, Belgium has decided to increase \r\nits military presence in Afghanistan, which will \r\namount to nearly 100 soldiers. We will also continue \r\nour contribution to the humanitarian effort as part \r\nof demining and economic and social development, \r\nprimarily through the United Nations agencies active \r\nin Afghanistan, coordinated by the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan.\r\nSecondly, the principle of ownership, which I have \r\njust mentioned, also applies to the peace process. The \r\ndraft resolution rightly underscores the importance of \r\na peace process led by the Afghans themselves. The \r\nKabul Process for Peace and Security Cooperation, \r\nlaunched on 6 June 2017 at the initiative of the Afghan \r\nGovernment, constitutes an essential element. Other \r\ninitiatives can contribute to peacebuilding, but it is \r\ncrucial and in the interest of all to ensure that those \r\nefforts are mutually reinforcing.\r\nThirdly, I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nwelcome the election of Afghanistan to the Human \r\nRights Council. We look forward to working alongside \r\nAfghanistan in that body. I would also like to commend \r\nthe Afghan Government’s commitments in that regard, \r\nparticularly with respect to the rights of women and \r\nchildren. In particular, I welcome the establishment \r\nof local child-protection units, and I encourage the \r\nauthorities to continue to address the situation of \r\nchildren in detention centres.\r\nFinally, a sustained demining effort remains \r\nessential. Afghanistan is among the countries in the \r\nworld most heavily affected by landmines, which have \r\na disproportionate impact on children. We welcome \r\nthe achievements in the implementation of the Mine \r\nAction Programme for Afghanistan, as well as the \r\npartial transfer of the management of that programme \r\nto the Directorate for Mine Action Coordination. We \r\nemphasize the need for continued efforts of that kind \r\nand for the adequate support of the international \r\ncommunity so that Afghanistan can become mine-free \r\nby 2023.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like once again to underscore \r\nthe ongoing commitment of Belgium to the development \r\nand lasting security of Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Bessho (Japan): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident for convening this important debate. I \r\nwould also like to extend my sincere appreciation to \r\nAmbassador Christoph Heusgen of Germany and \r\nhis colleagues for guiding the consultations on draft \r\nresolution A/72/L.8, on Afghanistan.\r\nToday we welcome to the Hall His Excellency \r\nMr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chief Executive of the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan, who has reaffirmed his \r\nGovernment’s strong commitment to pursuing Afghan-\r\nled development, stabilization and anti-corruption \r\nefforts. The response of the international community \r\nis clearly described in the draft resolution. We \r\nunanimously express our commitment to continuing \r\nto support Afghanistan and its people. However, our \r\nresponsibility does not end there. The focus is now on \r\nthe implementation of commitments both by the Afghan \r\nside and on the part of the international community. \r\nWe welcome the fact that, in the past year, there have \r\nbeen achievements in the political sphere, reform and \r\nthe strengthening of civic institutions. However, we \r\nalso see a rollback in economic development and a \r\ndeterioration in the security situation. Our ultimate \r\ntest will be whether Afghanistan achieves self-reliance \r\nto the point where donors no longer need to announce \r\nmulti-year pledges.\r\nJapan has consistently called on the Government of \r\nAfghanistan to fulfil its 2014 commitment to equitable \r\nrepresentation within the National Unity Government. \r\nWe believe that inclusivity is key to political stability \r\nin Afghanistan. Without it, genuine progress on an \r\nAfghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process that \r\nprovides significant security improvements cannot \r\nbe attained.\r\nIn that regard, the Kabul process meeting on \r\n6 June served as a good opportunity for Afghanistan \r\nto show its strong will to advance the peace process. \r\nJapan hopes that the second round of the Kabul process, \r\nscheduled for January next year, will yield tangible \r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 23/29\r\nsteps that contribute to the peace process. International \r\nand regional partners must be united in their support. \r\nViolent extremism, which undermines the social and \r\neconomic stability in Afghanistan, is primarily rooted \r\nin weak governance, but the lack of unity among \r\nregional stakeholders exacerbates the environment for \r\nthe Afghan Government in overcoming its challenges.\r\nJapan reiterates its appreciation and strong \r\nsupport for the tireless work of the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). The \r\nSecretary-General’s strategic review of the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, which \r\nJapan welcomes, will serve as important guidance for \r\nenhancing the Mission’s crucial tasks. Draft resolution \r\nA/72/L.8, put before the Assembly this morning, \r\ncalls for the implementation of the recommendations \r\nof the review. It is time for the Security Council to \r\nconsider how we can incorporate those findings into \r\nthe discussion on the renewal of the UNAMA mandate.\r\nA Japanese medical doctor, Dr. Tetsu Nakamura, \r\nhas contributed to the reconstruction of Afghanistan for \r\ndecades through his irrigation development projects. In \r\nhis view, if people have access to water resources, they \r\nwill have far less reason to become terrorists or start \r\na war, because water bring them satisfaction in life. \r\nAware of the fact that the development of an effective \r\nirrigation system offers a strong potential for improving \r\nagricultural production, which is the primary driver \r\nof economic growth in Afghanistan, the Government \r\nof Japan, together with the Afghan Government and \r\ninternational organizations, support the efforts of \r\nDr. Nakamura. The Afghanistan National Peace and \r\nDevelopment Framework underscores the importance \r\nof agriculture.\r\nJapan is eager to witness concrete progress in \r\ndevelopment and is committed to assisting Afghanistan \r\non its path towards self-reliance and a mutually \r\nbeneficial relationship with its neighbours and with the \r\ninternational community at large.\r\nMr. Mahfouz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, Egypt welcomes the consensus reached by \r\nmembers of the General Assembly on the adoption \r\nof the important draft resolution A/72/L.8 — a draft \r\nresolution that has been adopted every year. We have \r\nalways reaffirmed the vital role played by the General \r\nAssembly and the United Nations Assistance Mission \r\nin Afghanistan (UNAMA), in particular in the light \r\nof the report of the Secretary-General (A/72/312) on \r\nthe strategic review, which was launched to assess the \r\nwork, activities and effectiveness of that important \r\nUnited Nations Mission. The review demonstrates the \r\nneed for the vital role played by the General Assembly \r\nin Afghanistan.\r\nIn the light of the alignment of interests and the \r\nneed to ensure conditions conducive to stability \r\nin Central Asia and the Middle East, Egypt has \r\nconsistently supported the Afghan Government in \r\nits fight against terrorism and its concerted efforts \r\nto extend its control and sovereignty throughout the \r\ncountry. We also welcome the early preparations to hold \r\nelections, set for mid-2018. In addition, we support the \r\nAfghan authorities in their political and social efforts \r\nto bring about security, development and prosperity for \r\nall Afghan people.\r\nWe underscore that the trafficking of illicit drugs, \r\nin particular opium, threatens the stability and security \r\nof Afghanistan and the entire Central Asian region. \r\nIn that regard, we reaffirm the importance of close \r\ncooperation with the Afghan authorities at the regional \r\nand international levels on counter-narcotics, which \r\ncannot be separated from counter-terrorism efforts, \r\nsince drugs are a primary source of financing for \r\nterrorist groups and armed militias.\r\nIn accordance with the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions and reports of the Secretary-General, the \r\ninternational community has acknowledged the threat \r\nposed by the growing presence of the Islamic State in \r\nIraq and the Levant, or Da’esh, in Afghanistan, which \r\nhas strengthened and expanded its presence in the \r\ncountry. Terrorism is a scourge that must be overcome \r\nby all possible means. We must seek to suppress its \r\nevil through a comprehensive international strategic \r\nframework aimed at countering extremist ideologies \r\nin general.\r\nIn that regard, Egypt pledges to continue its \r\nspecialized high-level training programmes for the \r\nAfghan military and police, administered by the \r\nEgyptian Agency of Partnership for Development. We \r\nwill also continue our efforts to support the judicial, \r\ncultural, medical, nursing, agricultural, irrigation and \r\nbanking sectors, since we believe in the comprehensive \r\ncapacity-building of all Afghan national institutions. \r\nEgypt acknowledges the common international objective \r\nto which we aspire, namely, to build the capacities of the \r\nAfghan State so as to achieve peace, stability, security \r\nand sustainable development throughout the country. \r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n24/29 17-39043\r\nEgypt therefore calls on all international Powers and \r\nstakeholders, as well as the international community, to \r\ncontinue to meet their obligations towards Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Carlucci (Italy): Allow me to begin by \r\nexpressing our sincere appreciation to Germany for \r\nits capable facilitation of a difficult, yet ultimately \r\nsuccessful, negotiation on today’s draft resolution \r\nA/72/L.8. We are proud to co-sponsor the draft \r\nresolution to be adopted today. Allow me also to extend \r\nour thanks to Mr. Abdullah Abdullah for his presence \r\ntoday, which honours us.\r\nItaly remains deeply concerned about the security \r\nsituation in Afghanistan, where terrorists and violent \r\nextremists continue to pose a grave threat to the \r\nstability of the country, thereby severely hampering its \r\npotential for economic growth and development.\r\nThe latest reports on civilian casualties from the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan \r\npaint a telling picture. We continue to observe a \r\nworrying increase in civilian casualties, especially \r\namong vulnerable groups, such as women and children. \r\nWe note with particular concern the increase in attacks \r\ndirected against religious groups and places of worship. \r\nSince January 2016, such casualties have risen to a \r\nhigher level than the total number recorded in the \r\nperiod between 2009 and 2015.\r\nUnder those circumstances, it is imperative for us to \r\nrenew the full support of the international community \r\nto the National Unity Government’s efforts to achieve \r\nlasting peace and stability in Afghanistan. We continue \r\nto work together to defeat the terrorist threat in all its \r\nmanifestations, as well as to facilitate the pursuit of an \r\nAfghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process.\r\nItaly reiterates its conviction that the best path to \r\npeace and stability lies in a peaceful and negotiated \r\nsolution through an inclusive reconciliation process, \r\nwhile ensuring the participation of all segments of \r\nAfghan society, especially women. That process must \r\nwork towards a solution that respects the Afghan \r\nConstitution and the fundamental rights enshrined \r\ntherein for all Afghan men and women.\r\nItaly supports all initiatives that can lay the \r\nfoundation for that objective, first and foremost through \r\nthe Kabul process. In that context, we underline the \r\nimportance of the constructive cooperation of all \r\ninternational stakeholders, especially regional actors. \r\nThe overall stability of South and Central Asia cannot \r\nbe separated from the resolution of the conflict in \r\nAfghanistan. It is our hope that all of the region’s main \r\nactors will be able to converge around that common \r\ninterest, while building towards genuine cooperation in \r\norder to achieve that goal.\r\nIn order to support the peace and reconciliation \r\nprocess, it is equally crucial for the Afghan National \r\nDefence and Security Forces to be able to effectively \r\nrepel the continued attempts by insurgent groups \r\nto violently destabilize the country. Strengthening \r\nthe capabilities of the Afghan National Defence and \r\nSecurity Forces is an essential goal in that respect. \r\nWe pay tribute to their courage and sacrifice on the \r\nbattlefield. Italy will continue to play an active role \r\nin that regard in the context of the training, advising \r\nand assistance activities carried out by the NATO-led \r\nResolute Support Mission.\r\nFaced with such complex challenges, which \r\ngo beyond security, it is crucial that the citizens of \r\nAfghanistan be empowered so that they can continue to \r\nplace their trust in the country’s democratic institutions. \r\nThe legislative and district elections planned for 2018 \r\nwill constitute a crucial moment in that regard, and \r\ntheir transparency, credibility and inclusiveness must \r\nbe ensured. To that end, the completion of the remaining \r\naspects of electoral reform is essential. In the light of \r\nrecent developments, we hope that the Government and \r\nthe relevant Afghan institutions can work together to \r\nmake every effort to achieve that objective.\r\nIn order to build a positive trajectory of hope, \r\ndevelopment and self-reliance for Afghanistan and its \r\ncitizens, we encourage the effective implementation \r\nof the internal reforms to which the Government \r\ncommitted at the Brussels Conference on Afghanistan \r\nlast year in the framework of its partnership with the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe fight against corruption in all sectors is \r\ncertainly one of the most important in that regard. Italy \r\nwelcomes the measures already undertaken, including \r\nthe Government’s recent anti-corruption strategy, \r\nwhich must now be put into practice and deliver tangible \r\nresults. Concrete progress in areas such as justice, the \r\nrule of law and the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights, especially women’s and children’s rights, will \r\nbe equally important. The gains made in terms of \r\nwomen’s rights in Afghanistan over the past 16 years \r\nare undeniable, but they are still fragile when it comes \r\nto violence against women, female empowerment \r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 25/29\r\nand girls’ education, as demonstrated by the fact that \r\nfemale literacy rates remain very low. We welcome \r\nthe Afghan Government’s commitment to protecting \r\nand promoting women’s rights, and we encourage it to \r\nintensify its efforts in that domain.\r\nIn conclusion, the road to peace, stability and \r\nprosperity is one that Afghanistan and the international \r\ncommunity must continue to pursue together. While \r\nreaffirming once again its commitment to the country \r\nand people of Afghanistan, Italy will continue to be a \r\nstrong believer in that partnership.\r\nMr. Panayotov (Bulgaria): Allow me to begin \r\nby expressing my gratitude to the President for \r\nconvening this important annual debate. I would \r\nalso like to welcome Mr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chief \r\nExecutive of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and \r\nhis participation today. I would also like to thank the \r\nPermanent Mission of Germany for all its efforts, which \r\nhave resulted in consensus on the draft resolution on \r\nthe situation in Afghanistan (A/72/L.8), which Bulgaria \r\nhas co-sponsored.\r\nMy country aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade on behalf of the European Union (EU) and its \r\nmember States and reiterates the common messages \r\ntaken from the conclusions on the humanitarian \r\nsituation in Afghanistan reached by the Council of the \r\nEuropean Union in October, as well as the long-term \r\ncommitments set out in the EU strategy for engagement \r\nand cooperation with Afghanistan. I would like to make \r\nadditional remarks in my national capacity.\r\nBulgaria shares the determination of all our allies \r\nto help build defence and security institutions in that \r\ncountry and make Afghanistan safer and more secure. \r\nThat also includes our support for the National Unity \r\nGovernment’s efforts to establish a safe and democratic \r\nenvironment in the country and region, and for the \r\ninternational efforts, which contribute significantly to \r\nachieving that objective, in particular the new United \r\nStates strategy on Afghanistan and South Asia.\r\nBulgaria remains committed to the long-term \r\nsupport of NATO, which is driven by the understanding \r\nthat a secure and prosperous Afghanistan is vital for \r\nthe stability of the region and beyond. Our participation \r\nin the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission continues, \r\nwith an increased contingent of up to 160 Bulgarian \r\nsoldiers. Bulgaria also contributes financially to the \r\nAfghanistan National Army Trust Fund.\r\nThe volatile security and humanitarian environment \r\nmakes the unity of the Afghan Government and its \r\nperseverance in reforms critically important. The \r\npursuit of the ongoing reforms aimed at achieving a more \r\neffective Government that further increase political \r\ninclusiveness and reinforce accountability must remain \r\na priority. We fully support the Government’s efforts, \r\nin particular in areas such as good governance, the \r\nrule of law, institution-building and the fight against \r\ncorruption and narcotics, as well as gender and social \r\nissues, where further reforms are needed.\r\nBulgaria attaches particular importance to the \r\nongoing peace and reconciliation efforts and expresses \r\nsupport for constructive Afghan-led and Afghan-owned \r\npeace talks. We hope that the Kabul Process for Peace \r\nand Security will significantly contribute to achieving \r\nsuccess in that regard.\r\nRegional support and cooperation are also essential \r\nfor the security and development of Afghanistan. We \r\ncommend regional initiatives, such as the Heart of Asia-\r\nIstanbul Process on Regional Security and Cooperation \r\nfor a Secure and Stable Afghanistan and the Regional \r\nEconomic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan, \r\nand encourage regional actors to engage in a credible \r\nmanner with the efforts to achieve peace in the country, \r\nas well as its economic integration.\r\nThe United Nations support for electoral reforms, \r\npeace and reconciliation, human rights and women’s \r\nissues will continue to be crucial as well. We are \r\nconfident that, on the basis of the strategic review to be \r\ndiscussed early next year by the Security Council, the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan will \r\nremain well-positioned to deliver on its tasks.\r\nBulgaria has been a long-term partner of \r\nAfghanistan — a partner for peace and development. \r\nOur engagement was officially reconfirmed at the \r\nInternational Conference in Brussels in October 2016, \r\nand we maintain our contributions, including within \r\nthe framework of Bulgaria’s official development \r\nassistance policy, by organizing training courses for \r\ndiplomats, police officers and other civil servants from \r\nAfghan institutions. Mindful of the need to address \r\nthe challenges of migration and forced displacement in \r\nAfghanistan, in particular the vulnerability of children, \r\nthis year Bulgaria has taken part in the humanitarian \r\nresponse by contributing to the programmes and \r\nprojects on those topics run by UNICEF and the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration.\r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n26/29 17-39043\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate my country’s full \r\nsupport for Afghanistan and the work carried out by \r\nthe United Nations in the quest for peace in the country.\r\nMrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe delegation of Turkmenistan would like to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for preparing the reports on \r\nthe strategic review of the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan (A/72/312) and on the situation \r\nin Afghanistan and its implications for international \r\npeace and security (A/72/392). The delegation of \r\nTurkmenistan supports the draft resolution on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan (A/72/L.8), which we have \r\nco-sponsored. We furthermore support the consensus \r\nin that regard.\r\nWe extend our gratitude to the delegation of \r\nGermany as the facilitator of the draft resolution, \r\nand we thank it for its consistent proactive approach \r\nin that process. On the whole, Turkmenistan fully \r\nsupports the work of the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan and expresses its gratitude for \r\nthe long-term commitment and support on the part of \r\nthe United Nations to the Government and the people \r\nof Afghanistan.\r\nTurkmenistan attaches particular importance \r\nto relations with that neighbouring State and to the \r\ncontributions by the international community to the \r\ncreation of conditions for that country’s sustainable \r\ndevelopment, its full integration into regional and \r\nglobal processes and the establishment of lasting \r\npeace and harmony in the country. We consistently \r\ndeliver assistance to Afghanistan within various areas \r\nof socioeconomic development, including energy, \r\ntransport development, education and health care.\r\nWe believe that the key issue for Afghanistan is \r\nthe development of its socioeconomic infrastructure. \r\nTurkmenistan is convinced that economic growth, \r\nthe creation of new jobs, the implementation of broad \r\nsocial programmes, the improvement of material well-\r\nbeing and the level of education of its people positively \r\naffect the situation in the country and contribute to \r\nstrengthening peace and stability there.\r\nOn 14 and 15 November, Turkmenistan hosted the \r\nseventh Regional Economic Cooperation Conference \r\non Afghanistan. Its agenda featured a wide range of \r\nissues concerning the prospects for further developing \r\nconstructive partnerships with a view to achieving \r\nthe goals of common prosperity and progress. During \r\nthe Conference, special attention was paid to the \r\nimplementation of transport and energy projects with \r\nthe participation of Afghanistan. Such projects seek \r\nto promote Afghanistan’s integration into regional \r\nand international economic exchanges, full trade \r\nrelations, the attraction of large investments and the \r\ncreation of new jobs. In that context, the following \r\ninitiatives are noteworthy: the construction of the \r\nTurkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India gas \r\npipeline project, the development of the Turkmenistan-\r\nAfghanistan-Tajikistan regional railway corridor and \r\nthe implementation of a number of other projects \r\naimed at creating a modern, diversified transport and \r\ncommunications infrastructure in the region in the \r\neast-west and north-south directions.\r\nAs was mentioned previously by the Chief Executive \r\nof Afghanistan, Mr. Abdullah Abdullah, of particular \r\nimportance in the work of the seventh Regional \r\nConference was the signing of a five-sided agreement \r\non the establishment of the international Lapis Lazuli \r\nTransit, Trade and Transport Route linking Afghanistan, \r\nTurkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, which \r\nwill offer new opportunities for increasing the volumes \r\nof cargo transported along that route. At the same \r\ntime, that transport corridor will help to strengthen \r\ncooperation over a wide economic area, including the \r\nregions of Central and South Asia, the Caspian and \r\nBlack Sea basins and the Mediterranean. The holding of \r\nthe seventh Regional Conference, in Ashgabat, provided \r\nanother effective way of strengthening and expanding \r\nconstructive interaction in that connection by bringing \r\nregional economic cooperation to a qualitatively new \r\nlevel and working towards our multi-faceted potential \r\nand constructive goals.\r\nWe call upon Afghanistan and regional partners \r\nto sustain the momentum and continue their efforts to \r\nstrengthen regional dialogue and cooperation. We also \r\ncall for consistent targeted assistance to be provided to \r\nthe people and the Government of Afghanistan in the \r\ninterest of building peace and stability and ensuring \r\nState-building in the country.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank the Chief Executive of Afghanistan, \r\nMr. Abdullah Abdullah, for his statement. We also \r\nthank the delegation of Germany for facilitating the \r\nnegotiations on draft resolution A/72/L.8, which \r\nAzerbaijan is pleased to co-sponsor. We look forward \r\nto its unanimous adoption.\r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 27/29\r\nAzerbaijan commends the efforts of the Government \r\nof Afghanistan to implement political, economic and \r\nsocial reforms and address the country’s complex \r\nsecurity issues. The country’s well-being, economic \r\ngrowth and regional cooperation are interlinked and are \r\ndependent upon the security situation in Afghanistan \r\nand in the region. It is of the utmost importance to \r\ndemonstrate our resolve and strong will to continue \r\njointly addressing the security challenges that the \r\ncountry is facing and enhance regional cooperation to \r\nthat end.\r\nContinued regional and international commitment \r\nand assistance to Afghanistan are crucial for \r\nmaintaining the progress made so far and for efforts \r\nto fulfil the country’s aspiration to achieve long-term \r\npeace, stability and prosperity. Enhanced engagement \r\nbetween Afghanistan and its neighbours is essential for \r\nthe peaceful and stable future of the country and the \r\nregion. We commend Afghanistan’s efforts to integrate \r\nwith the regional and global economies and develop \r\ntrade with its neighbours and other partners through \r\nincreased regional connectivity.\r\nOver the years, Afghanistan has fostered \r\nregional cooperation and has successfully developed \r\ntransregional infrastructure with multimodal \r\ncapabilities along the east-west and north-south axes. \r\nThe Baku International Sea Trade Port and the recently \r\nopened Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway will help develop \r\ntransport and transit links, provide fast and reliable \r\nconnections, increase trade and make new business \r\nopportunities available for Afghanistan and other \r\ncountries in the region.\r\nAzerbaijan participates in the relevant international \r\nand regional political initiatives aimed at promoting \r\npeace, stability and sustainable development in \r\nAfghanistan, including the Heart of Asia-Istanbul \r\nProcess on Regional Security and Cooperation, with \r\na focus on ensuring a secure and stable Afghanistan. \r\nSince its inception, in 2011, the Istanbul Process has \r\nbecome an effective regional platform for enhanced \r\ncooperation, confidence-building and dialogue.\r\nThe forthcoming Heart of Asia Ministerial \r\nConference, to be held on 1 December in Baku on the \r\ntheme “Security and Economic Connectivity: Towards \r\na Strengthened Heart of Asia Region”, will provide \r\nan important opportunity for discussions among the \r\nmajor stakeholders on a wide range of issues, including \r\npeace, security, economic prosperity and social \r\nwelfare in the region. We will continue to support the \r\nstabilization, peaceful reconstruction and development \r\nof Afghanistan through bilateral cooperation and the \r\nrelevant multilateral, international and regional formats.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate Azerbaijan’s \r\nsupport for Afghanistan’s sovereignty, territorial \r\nintegrity and unity. We wish the Government of \r\nAfghanistan every success in its efforts to achieve a \r\nunified, peaceful and prosperous future for the country.\r\nMr. Sadykov (Kazakhstan): I would like to \r\nstart by paying tribute to President Asharaf Ghani \r\nand the Chief Executive of the Islamic Republic of \r\nAfghanistan, Mr. Abdullah Abdullah, for their valiant \r\nand self less commitment, and I take this opportunity \r\nto wish the Government and the people of Afghanistan \r\nevery success in their efforts to achieve peace and \r\nstability. My delegation would like to share the \r\nfollowing observations.\r\nKazakhstan welcomes the intensified efforts of \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan and its regional and \r\ninternational partners to resolve the internal political \r\ncrisis and establish peace in the country. My delegation \r\nis of the firm view that there is no alternative to a peaceful \r\nsolution to the problems in Afghanistan. We express \r\nthe hope that the measures taken by the Government of \r\nAfghanistan and its international partners to reconcile \r\nparties and establish peace will serve as the basis for a \r\ngood dialogue with positive results for the future.\r\nIt is heartening to note that the situation in \r\nAfghanistan received special attention at the historic \r\nSummit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization \r\nheld in Astana on 8 and 9 June, to which India and \r\nPakistan were admitted as full-f ledged members. \r\nWe are confident that, with the entry of those States \r\ninto the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the \r\nsolution of regional concerns — including those of \r\nAfghanistan — will move more dynamically.\r\nWe believe that consultations on Afghanistan in \r\nvarious formats are important and necessary in order \r\nto overcome political differences and work together \r\nto promote peace negotiations. It is equally vital to \r\nfocus on strengthening intra-regional relations with \r\nneighbouring countries.\r\nThe efforts of regional organizations such as the \r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization, the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe and the \r\nConference on Interaction and Confidence-building \r\nA/72/PV.56 20/11/2017\r\n28/29 17-39043\r\nMeasures in Asia, together with the Heart of Asia-\r\nIstanbul Process, are significant in laying the \r\nfoundations for stability. Afghanistan is one of our \r\npriorities as a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil. In January 2018, during our presidency of the \r\nCouncil, we plan to hold an open debate on building \r\na regional partnership involving Afghanistan and \r\nCentral Asia.\r\nWe note the deteriorating security situation in \r\nAfghanistan. The series of recent major terrorist \r\nattacks in the country require the entire international \r\ncommunity to take decisive actions to eradicate those \r\nthreats. Kazakhstan is concerned about the emergence \r\nof well-known radical terrorist groups in the north of \r\nAfghanistan and the escalating threats that they pose \r\nto the security of States in Central Asia, as well as to \r\nAfghanistan itself. The situation in Afghanistan plays \r\na special role in ensuring the long-term stability of \r\nthe entire region. Kazakhstan therefore fully shares \r\nand supports the vision of Secretary-General Guterres \r\naimed at strengthening preventive diplomacy.\r\nThe increased drug production in Afghanistan \r\nis alarming. It is clear that only joint efforts at the \r\ninternational and regional levels can achieve positive \r\nresults in the fight against drug trafficking. In that \r\nregard, it is necessary to support the coordinated \r\nmeasures taken by the Government of Afghanistan, \r\nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, \r\nINTERPOL and the Central Asian Regional \r\nInformation and Coordination Centre to combat illicit \r\ntrafficking in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances \r\nand their precursors.\r\nThe humanitarian situation in Afghanistan has \r\ndeteriorated considerably. Consequently, the civilian \r\npopulation, especially the elderly, women and children, \r\nare suffering the most. Attacks on schools and school \r\nstaff are also an alarming trend, as they impede access \r\nto education and to a return to normal living conditions. \r\nWe call for the adoption of comprehensive measures \r\nto assist Afghanistan in meeting its challenges in the \r\nhumanitarian sphere.\r\nKazakhstan has always considered, and continues \r\nto believe, that security and development are \r\ninterrelated and that it is necessary to promote them \r\non parallel tracks. Bearing that in mind, Kazakhstan \r\nhas provided, and will continue to provide, assistance \r\nto further Afghanistan’s development. In recent \r\nyears, Kazakhstan has provided assistance worth \r\napproximately $100 million to cover free education  for \r\n1,000 Afghan students through studies in specialized \r\ninstitutions in Kazakhstan.\r\nThe Government of Kazakhstan will also invest \r\nin the reconstruction of the Kunduz-Takhar highway, \r\ntogether with the construction of a school in the Dara-\r\nI-Suf district of Samangan province and a hospital in \r\nthe Waras district of Bamyan province. A bridge is \r\nalso being built, and the banks of the Aibak River are \r\nbeing reinforced in Samangan province. In view of the \r\ndrought and natural disasters in Afghanistan in recent \r\nmonths, the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan \r\nhas decided to provide humanitarian assistance to \r\nAfghanistan in the form of food supplies, which we will \r\nsend in the near future.\r\nWe consider it important to change the paradigm in \r\nAfghanistan and the way in which it has been perceived \r\nthus far. It should no longer be seen as a threat but an \r\nimportant partner with great potential. In that context, \r\nwe should help to connect Afghanistan with other \r\ncountries in the region, including those in Central Asia, \r\nmainly through economic integration. Such integration \r\ncan be further enabled by creating new infrastructure, \r\ntrade investment and transit transport projects.\r\nIn order to achieve those objectives, we deem it \r\nessential to create the United Nations regional centre \r\nin Almaty, in order to consolidate the work of the 18 \r\nregional and subregional offices of the United Nations \r\nsystem already situated in the city of Almaty. The \r\ncentre would coordinate and implement all activities \r\nwith a view to promoting sustainable development and \r\neconomic capacity-building and preventing natural \r\nand man-made disasters, as well as overcoming their \r\nconsequences. We believe that the centre in Almaty, \r\nwith a general focus on socioeconomic development, \r\nhumanitarian assistance, resilience-building and \r\ndisaster risk reduction, could substantially complement \r\nthe work of the United Nations Regional Centre for \r\nPreventive Diplomacy in Central Asia. Those two \r\nregional offices of the United Nations would, in a \r\nway, address almost the entire range of problems in \r\nthe region and overcome them with a view to bringing \r\ngreater stability to the region.\r\nTo conclude, let me confirm Kazakhstan’s \r\nmost sincere commitment to supporting the Afghan \r\nGovernment in its efforts to achieve peace, security \r\nand stability.\r\n20/11/2017 A/72/PV.56\r\n17-39043 29/29\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe Acting President: Before concluding, I should \r\nlike to consult members regarding an extension of the \r\nwork of the Second Committee. Members will recall \r\nthat at its second plenary meeting, on 15 September, the \r\nGeneral Assembly approved the recommendation of the \r\nGeneral Committee that the Second Committee would \r\ncomplete its work by Wednesday, 22 November.\r\nHowever, I have been informed by the Chair of \r\nthe Second Committee that the Committee requests \r\nan extension of its work to Thursday, 30 November, in \r\nview of the expectation that such an extension would \r\nfacilitate reaching consensus on the pending draft \r\nresolutions before the Committee.\r\nMay I therefore take it that the General Assembly \r\nagrees to extend the work of the Second Committee \r\nuntil Thursday, 30 November 2017?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
