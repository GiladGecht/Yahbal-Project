"United Nations A/72/PV.8\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n8th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 20 September 2017, 12.05 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Rajaonarimampianina \r\nRakotoarimanana (Madagascar), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 12.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the \r\nRepublic of Côte d’Ivoire\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nMr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Alassane \r\nOuattara, President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ouattara (spoke in French): I would \r\nfirst like to express my condolences to the Mexican \r\nGovernment and people after the earthquake.\r\nI wish to express the gratitude of the Ivorian people \r\nfor the great mobilization of countries gathered here \r\nthat elected Côte d’Ivoire to the Security Council for \r\nthe term 2018-2019. That election demonstrates, if \r\nthat were necessary, the Assembly’s support for my \r\ncountry’s ongoing commitment to peace and dialogue.\r\nIt is also a call to share with the the Assembly and \r\nthe world our experience in managing the emergence \r\nfrom a crisis and in effective cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations, as evidenced by the success of the \r\nUnited Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire. That \r\npeacekeeping operation, with its lessons learned, \r\nhas been acknowledged by all as one of the few \r\npeacekeeping successes of our global Organization \r\nin the past few decades. It should serve as inspiration \r\nto the United Nations in its peace initiatives. That is \r\nwhy Côte d’Ivoire, as a non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council — which status was just conferred \r\nby the Assembly — intends to promote fair and \r\npragmatic compromises in the settlement of crises on \r\nthe Council’s agenda.\r\nIn a world experiencing severe geopolitical \r\nturbulence and climate change, the theme of our session, \r\n“Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent \r\nlife for all on a sustainable planet”, is a call to action \r\nto strengthen peace in the world. We must conceive of \r\na development model that is better balanced among the \r\ncountries and more just among people. This theme us \r\nan urgent challenge to save our planet so that we can \r\nbuild the virtuous world we want for ourselves and for \r\nfuture generations.\r\nFrom the discussions we held with all countries as \r\nwe sought to promote our candidacy for the Security \r\nCouncil, we noted that there is an urgent need to respond \r\nto new global threats in order to achieve a lasting peace \r\nfor all. More than ever before, it is time to act and to \r\nfulfil our commitments, so as to meet the expectations \r\nof our peoples with regard to security and development.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Despite those encouraging \r\ndevelopments, and the success of anti-terrorist \r\noperations by major Powers and their allies in the \r\nMiddle East and, to a lesser extent, in Africa, the world \r\nis struggling to find a satisfactory collective response \r\nto terrorism. Under such conditions, those important \r\nsuccesses will be in vain and the terrorist threat will \r\nremain a source of concern if Africa continues to be the \r\nweak link in the global fight against terrorism.\r\nThe major Powers must intensify their commitment \r\nto combating terrorism in Africa and must provide \r\ngreater support to the efforts of the continent and the \r\nUnited Nations. We call for support for the Group of \r\nFive for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel), whose work is essential \r\nfor the security of a large part of the African continent. \r\nFor its part, Côte d’Ivoire will make support for the \r\nG5 Sahel and fighting terrorism in Africa one of the \r\npriorities during its term on the Security Council, since \r\nwithout stability there can be no development.\r\nGlobal warming is a real concern. No country \r\nis immune to the devastating effects of climate \r\nphenomena, which are jeopardizing our countries’ \r\npeoples and economies. We must therefore act quickly \r\nand responsibly if we are to preserve our environment \r\nand our planet.\r\nWith regard to the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, my Government will live up to its signing \r\nof it and will seek, inter alia, energy transitions, the \r\ndevelopment of smart agriculture and the preservation \r\nand protection of the environment. It is urgent that every \r\ncountry, like Côte d’Ivoire, uphold its commitments \r\nvoluntarily agreed to under the Paris Climate \r\nAgreement. In the same vein, developed countries must \r\nhonour their commitments to finance the adaptation \r\nof the economies of the countries in the South to the \r\nimpact of global warming. We must also be sensitive \r\nto the plight of many small island States. We must \r\nconsider climate change a real threat to international \r\npeace and security. We must urgently take the right \r\nsteps, including by adopting an international pact for \r\nthe environment, which has been proposed by France.\r\nMaintaining peace and security in the world also \r\nrequires strict management of the issue of nuclear \r\nweapons. We must do our utmost within the Security \r\nCouncil to find a peaceful solution to the serious \r\nnuclear tensions in the Korean peninsula. Any use of \r\nnuclear weapons in that region would demonstrate the \r\nmoral bankruptcy of our civilization and the end of the \r\nera we are living in. It would run the risk of a nuclear \r\nconflict with unforeseeable consequences. I therefore \r\ncall on the major Powers to show restraint and to enter \r\ninto dialogue with North Korea, in order to create the \r\nconditions for a lasting de-escalation and to reassure \r\nthe world with regard to maintaining peace and stability \r\nin that region.\r\nAll efforts to combat illegal immigration and \r\nhuman trafficking and smuggling have not put an end to \r\nthose phenomena, which continue to engulf thousands \r\nof young people from African countries in the \r\nMediterranean. On the contrary, they have contributed \r\nto the weakening of democracy and a rise of extremist \r\nfeelings, even in established Western democracies.\r\nTo put an end to those dangerous migrations, \r\ndeveloped countries, in particular countries and regions \r\nthat receive migrants, must mobilize investments and \r\nresources needed to finance development in migrants’ \r\ncountries of origin and transit so that their economies \r\nare able to offer jobs and opportunities to their youth. \r\nThe fight against people smugglers in countries of \r\norigin should also be intensified. Furthermore, the \r\ninternational community must put an end to the war \r\nin Libya and dismantle terrorist groups and smugglers’ \r\nnetworks that continue to traffic in human beings.\r\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, the response to this scourge is \r\nfocused on prevention by increasing awareness and \r\nassistance with return for those who attempt migration, \r\nas well as dismantling smuggling networks. The \r\nfight against illegal migration must respect existing \r\ninternational legal obligations that guarantee respect \r\nfor the human rights and the fundamental freedoms of \r\nall migrants.\r\nBuilding a peaceful and secure world remains our \r\npriority. Despite a difficult economic situation marked \r\nby a sudden drop in the price of cocoa, Côte d’Ivoire \r\nintends to honour its commitments in the framework \r\nof the implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs). In the context of its priority development \r\ngoals, Côte d’Ivoire has reached an average annual \r\ngrowth rate of 9 per cent per year over the past five \r\nyears, thanks to sound macroeconomic policy, the work \r\nof Ivoirians, an improved business environment and \r\nsignificant investment.\r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 3/29\r\nWe are now working to effectively distribute the \r\nfruit of that growth, particularly to the most destitute \r\nand the most vulnerable segments, all while seeking to \r\ntransform the country. That is the essence of the 2016-\r\n2020 national development programme and of the bold \r\nsocial reforms led by my Government. I would like to \r\nmake an urgent appeal to all States and civil society \r\norganizations so that the international mobilization \r\nfor the implementation of the SDGs does not fade. \r\nDeveloped nations must honour their commitments \r\nby contributing to financing for development in \r\naccordance with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda \r\nof the third International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development.\r\nWe must face the fact that the individual and, \r\nabove all, collective responses of our countries to the \r\nmain security challenges of our time are insufficient, \r\neven if we have achieved significant results in the \r\nfight against terrorism in certain theatres. The fact \r\nof the matter is that our world is vulnerable and no \r\nState can face the global threat alone. The rise of \r\nterrorism, the devastating effects of global warming \r\nand the persistence of nuclear tension, particularly in \r\nthe Korean peninsula, have sorely tested our collective \r\nsecurity architecture. We must therefore agree on the \r\nways to strengthen and modernize it so as to enable \r\nour countries to respond jointly and effectively to the \r\nserious threats of our times.\r\nWe must also afford pride of place to conflict \r\nprevention in order to spare our people the exorbitant \r\nhuman and material cost of war. In that connection, \r\nI welcome the implementation of the Joint United \r\nNations-African Union Framework for an Enhanced \r\nPartnership in Peace and Security, which will allow both \r\ninstitutions to work together closely during all stages of \r\nthe cycle of conflict in a predictable, systematic and \r\nstrategic manner.\r\nOur Organization is at an important turning point \r\nin its history. It is facing significant challenges in the \r\ncarrying out of its mission. It is therefore timely for \r\nmy country to pledge its full support for the reforms \r\ncalled for by Secretary-General António Guterres, and \r\nto renew our faith in him. His reforms are steps in the \r\nright direction. They ought to be pursued in that same \r\nspirit, with the support of all countries. Côte d’Ivoire \r\nis ready to write a new page in its history at the United \r\nNations after its election to the Security Council, \r\nthanks to the support of all. We must continue to work \r\ntogether in the interest of our Organization in order to \r\nadvance the priority causes of our peoples.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Petro Poroshenko, President \r\nof Ukraine\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Petro Poroshenko, \r\nPresident of Ukraine.\r\nMr. Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Petro Poroshenko, President \r\nof Ukraine, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Poroshenko: On behalf of Ukraine, \r\nI sincerely congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session. Ukraine fully supports all six \r\npriorities for the upcoming session defined by him and \r\nis ready to assist him in his noble efforts.\r\nA lot must be done to translate our common vision \r\nof a peaceful, prosperous and equal world into reality. \r\nThe spiral of violence continues to affect more and more \r\ncountries and regions. Transnational terrorism, the use \r\nof force in international relations, the proliferation \r\nof weapons of mass destruction, the refugee crisis, \r\npoverty, human rights violations and environmental \r\nfragility are only some of the challenges we face. The \r\nscope of the threats demands our joint and resolute \r\nresponse. It is time to act, and we have a very narrow \r\nwindow of opportunity to avoid an irreversible decline.\r\nThe United Nations should be at the forefront of \r\nthis process. Ukraine has always advocated for the need \r\nto reform the Organization to meet the most urgent \r\nglobal challenges in a timely and adequate manner. In \r\nthat regard, we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, since the first day of his mandate, to develop \r\nand implement a robust and comprehensive United \r\nNations reform agenda. We support no less the United \r\nStates initiative to promote an effective and meaningful \r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n4/29 17-29395\r\nreform of the United Nations. Comprehensive reform \r\nof the Security Council is long overdue, and we hope \r\nthat this session will herald new momentum in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the blueprint for the \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to state clearly that \r\nwe in Ukraine could not agree more with the call for \r\nthe sovereignty of nations to be universally respected \r\nand guaranteed. That very conclusion was timely and \r\nrightly raised yesterday from this rostrum. When \r\nthe United Nations was set up, it was designed to \r\nmaintain peace and security in the world, based on the \r\nprinciple of respect for the sovereignty of States and \r\nthe integrity of their borders. The founding nations, \r\nincluding Ukraine, aimed to secure a world where the \r\nsovereign rights of free choice would be respected. \r\nThe five permanent members of the Security Council \r\n(P-5) were to safeguard that principle in the name of \r\nsustainable peace and security. That was the principle \r\nthat one of the P-5 member States so blatantly violated \r\nagainst my own country. This principle needs to be \r\nput back on track using whatever means and tools we \r\nhave at hand. Ukraine is the right place to invest in \r\nthat noble endeavour, in the name of sustainable peace \r\nand security.\r\nThat is what millions of Ukrainians have struggled \r\nfor since the beginning of the Russian aggression in \r\n2014 in both Donbas and Crimea. A three-year-long \r\nwar with Russia has resulted in 10,000 people killed \r\nand 7 per cent of Ukrainian territory occupied, and \r\n20 per cent of the Ukrainian economy and industrial \r\noutput has been seized, destroyed or simply stolen.\r\nHowever, the most horrific thing in this situation is \r\nthat the Kremlin has consciously chosen the tactics of \r\nincreasing human suffering. According to human rights \r\nactivists, the occupied Crimean peninsula has turned \r\ninto a territory of repression. Anyone disagreeing \r\nwith the Kremlin risks their freedom, and even their \r\nlife. Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars get arrested even \r\nfor posting in social networks or — as was case of \r\nthe Crimean farmer Volodymyr Balukh, in December \r\n2016 — just for putting a Ukrainian national f lag on his \r\nprivate residence.\r\nPersecution of the leaders of the Mejlis — the \r\nrepresentative organ of Crimean Tatars, whose activities \r\nthe Russian occupiers banned — continues. Only a \r\nweek ago, Ahtem Chiygoz, Deputy Head of the Mejlis, \r\nwas sentenced to eight years in prison for standing up \r\nagainst the Russian occupation. Another Deputy Head \r\nof the Mejlis, Ilmi Umerov, who has a serious health \r\nproblem, remains under house arrest, not even allowed \r\nto leave Crimea for medical treatment.\r\nRussia blatantly violates resolution 71/205,  entitled \r\n“Situation of human rights in the Autonomous Republic \r\nof Crimea and the city of Sevastopol (Ukraine)”. It keeps \r\nignoring all requests of the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights to ensure proper \r\nand full access of the international human rights \r\nmonitoring mission to Crimea. The Kremlin pays no \r\nrespect to the provisional measures of the International \r\nCourt of Justice imposed on it. The Court urged Russia \r\nto refrain from maintaining or imposing limitations on \r\nthe ability of the Crimean Tatar community to conserve \r\nits representative institutions, including the Mejlis, and \r\nto ensure the right for Ukrainian citizens to study in the \r\nUkrainian language.\r\nThe international community must give a proper \r\nresponse to such Russian disregard of its international \r\nobligations. It must keep a close eye on Crimea to prevent \r\na new genocide inspired by the modern proponents of \r\nStalin’s totalitarian ideology against the Crimean Tatars \r\nand Ukrainians. I rely on the support of delegations \r\nhere for Ukraine’s initiatives to ensure the observance \r\nof human rights in the temporarily occupied Crimea, \r\nin particular in a further General Assembly resolution.\r\nWe need to strengthen the international regime of \r\nde-occupation of Crimea. The fact that at the highest \r\ninternational level — the General Assembly — Russia \r\nwas recognized as an occupying Power proves that we \r\nare on the absolutely right track. The time has come \r\nto establish a new international group of friends of \r\nUkrainian Crimea to coordinate and promote our \r\ncommon steps. We count on the coordinated and \r\ntargeted support of our international partners.\r\nThe militarization of Crimea is another security \r\nthreat that affects the whole of Southern and Eastern \r\nEurope, as well as North Africa and the Middle East. \r\nUkraine strongly condemns the numerous military \r\nexercises conducted in occupied Crimea, as well as \r\nthose close to the borders of Ukraine, in particular that \r\nknown as West-2017. Together with our neighbours \r\nand partners, we urge Russia to ensure full compliance \r\nwith its commitments under the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Vienna \r\nDocument and other international rules concerning \r\nmilitary activity.\r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 5/29\r\nThe security and human rights situations in Donbas \r\nremain no less dramatic than in Crimea. This year, \r\nUkraine initiated three major ceasefire attempts — the \r\nEaster, Harvest and Back-to-School ceasefires. Yet \r\nagain, Russian occupation troops and their proxies \r\nviolated them almost immediately. In breach of the \r\nMinsk agreements, Russia keeps its regular military in \r\ncertain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and \r\ncontinues to supply heavy weapons and ammunition to \r\nthe occupation troops. It f latly denies the establishment \r\nof the OSCE permanent control over the Ukraine-Russia \r\nborder, and the release of hostages within the Minsk \r\nprocess is completely deadlocked.\r\nThe list of Ukrainian hostages in Donbas grows \r\nconstantly. People are captured deliberately. Their only \r\nfault is that they have a pro-Ukrainian position. We \r\nremember the fate of 16-year-old Stepan Chubenko, \r\nwho was killed with five shots in the head after Russians \r\nsaw him wearing a Ukrainian ribbon. Another example \r\nis the 63-year-old Donetsk theologian Ihor Kozlovsky, \r\nwho has been in jail for over two years under false \r\naccusations and deprived of any communication with \r\nhis family and friends. Russia still keeps at least 16 \r\nUkrainian political prisoners on its territory. Ukrainian \r\nfilm director Oleh Sentsov and Ukrainian journalist \r\nRoman Suschenko are among the most prominent cases.\r\nJust think about it. Stealing other nations’ land, \r\nkidnapping people, conducting a hidden war, downing \r\na civilian aircraft, spreading lies globally — is this the \r\nkind of behaviour we expect from a permanent member \r\nof the Security Council? Russia is not a contributor \r\nto international security, but its biggest threat. Russia \r\nis perhaps the only country in the world that has \r\nconflicts — hot, frozen or potential — with almost all \r\nits neighbours.\r\nThe key problem in Donbas is that Ukraine and \r\nRussia strive for completely different things. Ukraine \r\nwants peace and restoration of sovereignty over its \r\nterritory. Russia wants control over Ukraine and \r\nundermines every effort to restore our sovereign control \r\nwithin Ukraine’s borders. To that end, Russia tries to \r\nexchange peace in Ukraine for Ukraine’s freedom. I \r\nwant to utter a very strong message — Ukraine will \r\nnever accept that kind of a deal, nor will the international \r\ncommunity.The latest hybrid peacekeeping proposals \r\nfrom Moscow are yet another example of Russia’s \r\nreal ambitions: to legalize its proxies and to freeze the \r\nconflict forever.\r\nWe would welcome any proposal that would bring \r\npeace to my country. We remain convinced that a full-\r\nf ledged United Nations peacekeeping operation is the \r\nonly viable solution to de-escalate, to protect people \r\nof Ukraine and to get us closer to a political solution. \r\nThat is why the peacekeepers’ mandate should cover \r\nthe entire occupied area, including the Ukrainian-\r\nRussian State border. That is the must. As long as the \r\nborder is used as the main supply route for manpower \r\nand weapons to Donbas, there will be no peace in \r\nmy country.\r\nThe mission should respect basic United Nations \r\npeacekeeping principles and guidelines. One of them is \r\nthat United Nations peacekeepers should be impartial. \r\nThere is no place for the aggressor’s personnel. They \r\ncannot be a part of it by definition. Let me stress \r\nthat any abuse of the United Nations peacekeeping \r\ntoolbox to secure the gains of aggression is absolutely \r\nunacceptable. If we have an opportunity to bring peace \r\nto the heart of Europe, we should get the conditions \r\nright. A robust international presence can also help \r\nus cope with the increase in terrorist activities in the \r\nconflict-affected areas. The terrorist component in \r\nRussia’s hybrid war against Ukraine is clearly visible \r\nand has become a reality of everyday life in Donbas.\r\nThree years ago, the world was stunned when \r\nMalaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, with 298 people on \r\nboard, was blown up in the skies over Donbas. Ukraine \r\nis determined to do everything to bring to justice those \r\nresponsible for that mass murder. Two investigations, \r\ntechnical and criminal, have been carried out. Both \r\nrevealed the details. Those who were behind that \r\nhorrible crime came from Russia. The missile came \r\nfrom Russia. The death of the MH-17 victims is on \r\nRussia’s conscience. The five countries that comprise \r\nthe Joint Investigation Team have decided to prosecute \r\nthose responsible for downing Malaysia Airlines Flight \r\nMH-17 within the Dutch judicial system. \r\nThis year, the International Court of Justice started \r\nhearing the case brought by Ukraine against Russia for \r\nthe violation of the 1999 International Convention for \r\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, and we \r\nhope that the decision of the United Nations highest \r\ncourt will help bring the Russian Federation to justice \r\nfor its numerous violations of international law and for \r\nfinancing crimes committed since 2014. As the process \r\nbegins, we count on the support and facilitation of all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations.\r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n6/29 17-29395\r\nFor decades, Ukraine has served as a resolute \r\ncontributor to global security. In the name of peace \r\nand in exchange for security assurances, Ukraine gave \r\nup its nuclear arsenal — the third-largest in the world. \r\nTwenty years after being invaded by one of those who \r\nwere bound to respect and, if necessary, to protect \r\nUkraine’s border, we neverthless remain a resolute \r\nadvocate of global non-proliferation and disarmament. \r\nThat is why we strongly condemn the nuclear tests \r\nand multiple launches of ballistic missiles by North \r\nKorea. We are deeply concerned about the continuous \r\ndiversion of resources from critical human needs to \r\nfuel Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal, coupled with serious \r\nhuman rights abuses. We resolutely stand for reinforced \r\nmeasures to stop Pyongyang’s illegal activities and to \r\nbring North Korea into line with the international legal \r\nframework. At the same time, let me reiterate Ukraine’s \r\ncall on the Security Council to undertake an in-depth \r\ninvestigation into developments in the North Korean \r\nnuclear and missiles programme in order to expose any \r\npossible foreign assistant to Pyongyang in that area.\r\nWe also express our deepest concern over the \r\ncurrent situation in Syria. We believe that the full \r\nimplementation of and adherence to the word and spirit \r\nof the 2012 Geneva communiqué (A/66/865, annex) and \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2254 (2015) are absolutely \r\nvital for the settlement of the conflict in that country. \r\nWhat draws our special concern with regard to that \r\nbloody conflict is Russia’s use of occupied Crimea as \r\na military outpost for projecting power in Syria. As the \r\nwar there rages on, a huge number of Russian military \r\nassets are deployed to Syria by ships based in the \r\nCrimean harbour.\r\nIt is also deeply disturbing that the African \r\ncontinent continues to suffer from numerous \r\nunresolved conflicts. As a non-permanent member of \r\nthe Security Council, my country has spared no effort \r\nto support the African continent in safeguarding the \r\nmain principles of the international order: sovereignty, \r\nnon-interference in domestic affairs, the rule of law and \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. \r\nAs the Chair of the Security Council Committee \r\nestablished pursuant to resolution 2127 (2013) \r\nconcerning the Central African Republic, we have \r\nactively supported regional and international efforts to \r\nstabilize the situation in the Central African Republic. \r\nIn January 2017, Ukraine assumed the chairmanship of \r\nthe Security Council Committee established pursuant \r\nto resolution 1591 (2005) concerning the Sudan, and we \r\nare determined to contribute to the international efforts \r\nto resolve the conflict in Darfur. African countries can \r\nfully count on Ukraine as their reliable friend.\r\nMy country is fully committed to implementing \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to \r\nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Despite \r\nheavy defence expenses — more than 5 per cent of \r\nour gross domestic product — Ukraine continues to \r\ngo through a fundamental transformation, fighting \r\ncorruption, promoting judicial reform, implementing \r\ndecentralization and improving business opportunities. \r\nA year and a half ago, the economic situation in \r\nUkraine was so dire that we could only dream about \r\nmacroeconomic stabilization. Now we have grounds \r\nto say that economic recovery is in place. Among \r\nour priorities within the 2030 Development Agenda \r\nin Ukraine are such areas as ensuring a sustainable \r\nenergy supply, food security, promoting innovation, \r\ndevelopment and sustainable infrastructure, as well as \r\npromoting an effective public health system, affordable \r\neducation and decent work. \r\nI am convinced that no country alone can achieve \r\nsustainable development without sustainable peace and \r\nsustainable security. There is also no doubt that the \r\nmitigation of global warming remains an indispensable \r\nelement of sustainable development. I am proud \r\nthat Ukraine is fully committed to our obligations \r\nunder the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Our \r\nintentions in that regard are very serious. Ukraine was \r\nthe first European country to deposit its instrument of \r\nratification with the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations has always played a leading \r\nrole in ensuring that the crimes of the past can never \r\nhappen again. The seventy-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly coincides with the eighty-fifth \r\nanniversary of one of the deadliest crimes of the \r\ntwentieth century — the Holodomor. It was a man-\r\nmade famine in Ukraine in 1932 and 1933, organized \r\nby the totalitarian regime of Stalin, which killed from \r\n7 million to 10 million Ukrainians. Mr. Raphael Lemkin, \r\nthe author of the Convention on the Prevention and \r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in 1948, described the destruction of \r\nthe Ukrainian nation as a classic example of genocide. \r\nI appeal to all United Nations States Members to make \r\ntheir own historic judgment and to make a decision to \r\nrecognize the Holodomor as an act of genocide.\r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 7/29\r\nThis is a challenging time for all of us. Ever more \r\npeople die in wars and natural disasters. Truth is \r\nblindsided by post-truth. The world is divided again \r\nbetween those who believe that freedom is indispensable \r\nand those who believe that freedom is expendable. One \r\ngroup wants to reach a better future, the other drags us \r\nto the past. It is time for those who believe in freedom \r\nto come together. It is time for freedom to be strong, \r\nconvincing and convinced. Let it be that way.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof Ukraine for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the \r\nState of Palestine\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe State of Palestine.\r\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State of \r\nPalestine, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud \r\nAbbas, President of the State of Palestine, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Abbas (spoke in Arabic): Twenty-\r\nfour years have passed since the signing of the Oslo \r\nAccords, an interim agreement that set a five-year \r\nperiod for bringing an end to the Israeli occupation, \r\ngiving hope to the Palestinian people that they would \r\nsoon achieve independence within their State and peace \r\nbetween Palestinians and Israelis. What is left of that \r\nhope today? We recognized the State of Israel within \r\nthe 1967 borders, but Israel’s continued refusal to do the \r\nsame has called into question the mutual recognition \r\nthat we signed in Oslo in 1993.\r\nSince my address to the Assembly last year (see \r\nA/71/PV.14), when I urged us to make 2017 the year for \r\nending the Israeli occupation of the territory of the State \r\nof Palestine, the Israeli Government has relentlessly \r\npursued its settlement campaign on our land, in \r\ncontravention of all international conventions and the \r\nrelevant resolutions on the question of Palestine. It has \r\nalso persisted in its f lagrant disregard for reaching a \r\ntwo-State solution, resorting to delaying policies and \r\ntactics and devising pretexts to evade its responsibility \r\nfor ending its occupation of the territory of the State of \r\nPalestine. Instead of addressing the underlying issues \r\nand resolving the root causes of the conflict, it has tried \r\nto divert international attention to secondary issues \r\nthat in fact are caused by its colonial policies.\r\nWhile we continue to call — as does the \r\ninternational community — for an end to the Israeli \r\noccupation of our State’s territory, Israel incites trouble \r\nand makes false accusations, pretends that there is \r\nno Palestinian partner and imposes unreasonable, \r\nobstructive conditions. Israel is well aware, as we \r\nall are, that its occupation breeds provocations and \r\nviolence. Its military occupation of our land has now \r\nlasted for more than half a century.\r\nTen years ago, in a decision made by the United \r\nStates, we agreed together to establish a tripartite \r\ncommittee to address the issue of incitement, made \r\nup of the United States, Palestine and Israel. The \r\ncommittee worked for some time but was eventually \r\ndisbanded, and since then we have called for its revival, \r\nto no avail. Who is committing incitement now? And \r\nwho is trying to maintain it? It is therefore very strange \r\nto hear some of those who should be responsible for \r\nending the occupation refer to it as a half-occupation, \r\nor an alleged occupation.\r\nWhat is meant by “alleged occupation”? For 50 \r\nyears we have languished under the yoke of occupation, \r\nand now someone who is responsible says that this \r\nis an alleged occupation. That is unfair, wrong and \r\nunacceptable. Israel’s continuation of the occupation is \r\nan affront to the international community. The United \r\nNations has a legal, political, moral and humanitarian \r\nobligation to end it and enable the Palestinian people \r\nto live in freedom and prosperity in their independent \r\nState of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital and \r\nwithin the 4 June 1967 borders. That is the responsibility \r\nof the United Nations and the international community.\r\nThere can be no doubt that draining the quagmire \r\nof the colonial occupation of our land and ending its \r\nunjust, oppressive and illegal practices against our \r\npeople would have an enormous effect on the fight \r\nagainst terrorism, thereby depriving terrorist groups of \r\none of the key rallying cries they exploit to promote \r\ntheir obscurantist ideas. We therefore reiterate that it is \r\nvitally urgent to end the Israeli occupation of our land, \r\nsince it is an integral part of the efforts that we must \r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n8/29 17-29395\r\nall make to confront such groups. Palestinians oppose \r\nall internal and international terrorist organizations, \r\nwhatever their nature, origins or character. We stand \r\nagainst international terrorism and we are fighting it.\r\nWe have explored every avenue and exerted enormous \r\nefforts to achieve peace with our Israeli neighbours. \r\nTogether with other Arab and Islamic States, we have \r\nadopted the invaluable Arab Peace Initiative, aimed \r\nat resolving the Palestinian and Arab-Israeli conflict. \r\nThe Initiative states that upon Israel’s withdrawal from \r\nthe Palestinian and Arab territories — the Golan and \r\nShaba’a farmlands — occupied since 1967, the Arab \r\nand Islamic States will recognize Israel and normalize \r\nrelations with it. What has been the Israeli response? \r\nFifty-seven Arab and Islamic States have said that they \r\nare ready to recognize and normalize relations with \r\nIsrael, but Israel is not interested.\r\nIn 2003, there was also the 2003 Quartet road \r\nmap for an Israeli-Palestinian peace, endorsed by the \r\nSecurity Council and accepted by Palestine. It, too, was \r\nrejected by the Israeli Government — so apparently \r\nIsrael is above the law. Next, a French-led initiative \r\nfor peace attempted to break the stalemate in the peace \r\nprocess and ensure a successful effort to salvage the \r\npeace process and a two-State solution. It led to the \r\nconvening earlier this year in Paris of the Conference \r\nfor Peace in the Middle East, which was attended by \r\n70 States and four international organizations. Israel \r\nhas rejected and boycotted all of those efforts. Besides \r\nthose I have already mentioned, President Vladimir \r\nPutin of Russia and President Xi Jinping of China have \r\nalso launched initiatives for peace. The latest of those \r\npeace efforts — all of which we are grateful for — is \r\nbeing led by United States President Donald Trump. \r\nWhere are those initiatives and why will Israel not \r\naccept them?\r\nFor our part, we have also repeatedly tried to revive \r\nthe peace process. We have called on the Israeli Prime \r\nMinister simply to affirm his commitment to a two-\r\nState solution and sit with us at the negotiation table \r\nto delineate the borders between Israel and the State of \r\nPalestine in order to open a path for meaningful talks on \r\nresolving all the other final status issues. Unfortunately, \r\nhe rejected that offer. We have continued our genuine \r\nefforts to achieve a successful peace process, and Israel \r\nnonetheless continues to ignore its commitments and \r\nobstruct those efforts through its relentless settlement \r\nactivities. There is no place left for the State of Palestine, \r\nand that is unacceptable both to us and to those here in \r\nthis Hall. The fact is that Israel is rejecting a two-State \r\nsolution, posing a real threat to Israelis and Palestinians \r\nalike. We will therefore be compelled to undertake a \r\ncomprehensive strategic review of the entire process.\r\nA commitment to peace by one side is never enough \r\nto achieve peace. Either we are free or not free. We \r\nhave issued warnings in the past, and continue to do so \r\ntoday, about the Israeli policies aimed at entrenching \r\nthe occupation and colonial facts on the ground in East \r\nJerusalem. We have pointed out that those policies fuel \r\nreligious animosity and could lead to a violent religious \r\nconflict. We have called on the Israeli Government to \r\nuphold the historic and legal status quo of the city’s holy \r\nsites. However, since its occupation of East Jerusalem \r\nin 1967, the Israeli Government has repeatedly and \r\nunilaterally annexed Jerusalem. Jerusalem is occupied. \r\nIt also decided to annex Golan, and did so. We rejected \r\nthat at the time and continue to do so, together with the \r\nentier international community, including the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nThe Security Council, the principal world \r\nauthority on peace and security, has adopted numerous \r\nresolutions stating that such annexation processes are \r\nillegal. To whom should we turn? Since the Security \r\nCouncil and General Assembly resolutions are not \r\nbeing implemented, to whom should we turn? We have \r\nnot chosen a path of terrorism or violence. Jerusalem is \r\nan occupied city. Israel’s decisions and practices there \r\nare null and void and entirely illegal. The same applies \r\nto all the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the \r\nrest of the occupied Palestinian territory.\r\nIsrael’s attempts to change the historic status quo \r\nin Al-Quds and particularly the status and integrity of \r\nthe Al-Aqsa Mosque can be described only as playing \r\nwith fire and an infringement on our responsibilities \r\nand those of our brother country Jordan. We are both \r\nresponsible for the city. We have warned the Israeli \r\nGovernment about the implications of such an act of \r\naggression and will hold it fully responsible for the \r\nconsequences. We do not desire a religious war, which \r\nwould be dangerous for everyone. Our conflict is \r\npolitical, not religious, so let us leave religious issues \r\nout of the equation.\r\nDespite the ongoing occupation and its oppressive \r\npolicies and practices, we have been working effectively \r\nto build the institutions of our State, which has been \r\nrecognized by a majority — 138 of those present — of \r\nthe States Members of the United Nations. I would like \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 9/29\r\nto take this opportunity to once again thank all of the \r\ncountries that have recognized the State of Palestine \r\nand have voted for upgrading its status at the United \r\nNations. That is certainly helping to remedy the historic \r\ninjustice that has befallen our people and showing \r\nsupport for the goal of peace between the Israelis and \r\nPalestinians in the Middle East and around the world.\r\nI also stressed in my address to the Assembly last \r\nyear that the status quo in the occupied territory of \r\nthe State of Palestine is unsustainable. However, since \r\nthe situation has only deteriorated, owing to Israel’s \r\ninsistence on pursuing its occupation, aggressive \r\npolicies and unending violations of international law, \r\nwe must once again call on Israel, as the occupying \r\nPower, to fully respect and uphold all the obligations \r\nthat its occupation implies and bear the consequences.\r\nWe cannot continue to be an Authority that has \r\nno authority or to allow the occupation to continue at \r\nno cost. We are fast approaching that point. If Israel \r\ndoes not want a two-State solution, if it does not \r\nwant peace, let it assume its responsibilities and bear \r\ntheir consequences, because we will not bear those \r\nresponsibilities for them. Today a two-State solution \r\nis in jeopardy. As Palestinians, we cannot stand \r\nstill in the face of that threat, which is targeting our \r\nnational, political and social existence on our land \r\nand endangering regional and international peace \r\nand security. We will have to take steps or look for \r\nalternatives in order to preserve our national existence \r\nand maintain the prospects for peace and security. But \r\nany option we try will be peaceful.\r\nIn such a situation, we have the right to seek \r\nalternatives that preserve our rights and protect our land \r\nand our people from a hardening system of the type of \r\napartheid that ended in South Africa long ago but that \r\ncontinues to persist in Palestine. Is that acceptable? Can \r\nthe world accept an apartheid regime in the twenty-first \r\ncentury in Palestine? Why, then, is there one?\r\nOn the other hand, we have called on the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, which is our right. If \r\nnobody wants to listen to us, then we will pursue all \r\navenues to justice. We have called on the International \r\nCriminal Court to open an investigation and prosecute \r\nIsraeli officials for their involvement in settlement \r\nactivities and aggressions against our people. We will \r\ncontinue to pursue our accessions to international \r\nconventions, protocols and organizations, as Palestine \r\nhas acquired observer status pursuant to resolution \r\n67/19 of 2012. I will convene the Palestinian National \r\nCouncil in the near future to operationalize a strategic \r\nreview of these efforts.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nPalestinians, Arabs and the world as a whole have \r\na choice as to whether to respect international law and \r\nimplement the two-State solution based on the 1967 \r\nborders. We will give the efforts being undertaken \r\nby President Donald Trump, the Quartet and the \r\ninternational community at large every chance to \r\nsucceed so that a historic agreement or deal may be \r\nreached. We have heard that they are trying to strike \r\na historic deal. We would like to thank them and hope \r\nthat it will come to fruition soon.\r\nWe stress the two-State solution, which would \r\nenable the State of Palestine to live side-by-side with the \r\nState of Israel in security and peace. But if the two-State \r\nsolution were to be fall apart due to the establishment \r\nof a one-State reality with two systems — a system of \r\napartheid — following the unchecked imposition of \r\nthe occupation that our people and the international \r\ncommunity reject, that would be a failure, and neither \r\nthe international community nor we will have any other \r\nchoice but to continue the struggle and demand full and \r\nequal rights for all inhabitants of historic Palestine. \r\nThis is not a threat, but we are warning Israel of the \r\nrealities and the consequences of its ongoing policies \r\nthat are gravely undermining the two-State solution. \r\nWhat do the Israelis want? Even if they talk about other \r\nissues, we continue to choose the two-State solution.\r\nOur problem is with the Israeli colonial occupation, \r\nnot with Judaism as a religion. Judaism for us \r\nPalestinians, be they Christian or Muslim, will never \r\nbe considered a threat. It is an Abrahamic religion, like \r\nIslam and Christianity. God Almighty tells us in the \r\nQur’an that, in the name of God the Compassionate and \r\nthe Merciful, we should not distinguish between his \r\nmessengers. Indeed, all His messengers — Mohammed, \r\nJesus and others — are equal. All these religions \r\nare equal, and we do not make distinctions between \r\nprophets or messengers. On this occasion, we \r\ncongratulate the Jews on their new year. We would \r\nalso like to congratulate Muslims for their new Hijri \r\nyear starting tomorrow. This is proof of our desire for a \r\nrapprochement among religions.\r\nWe have dutifully upheld our responsibilities \r\ntowards our people in the Gaza Strip despite the split \r\nwith Hamas that has been in place since 2007. Since that \r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n10/29 17-29395\r\ntime, we have provided all forms of support on our own \r\nto our people in Gaza, who are gravely suffering from \r\nthe cruel Israeli blockade. We have repeatedly affirmed \r\nthat no one is more aware of the interests of our people \r\nin Gaza Strip than we are. We are eager to see to the \r\ninterests of the people in Gaza served. We have said \r\nthat there will be no State in Gaza alone and there will \r\nbe no Palestinian State without the Gaza Strip. A State \r\nin Gaza alone is a false dream, and our State will be \r\ncomplete only when the Gaza Strip is part of it.\r\nI must express my relief at the agreement reached \r\nin Cairo as a result of Egyptian efforts. We are grateful \r\nfor those efforts aimed at nullifying the measures taken \r\nby Hamas following the split with us, including the \r\nformation of a Government. The Hamas Government \r\nhas been cancelled, and there is now a commitment to \r\nthe National Unity Government, which is a Government \r\nof national consensus, which will enable it to exercise \r\nits authority in the Gaza Strip and allow for general \r\nelections to be held. This agreement has met with our \r\nsatisfaction. Next week, our Government is going to the \r\nGaza Strip to assume its responsibilities. We wish the \r\nGovernment every success.\r\nIn my address to the General Assembly last year, \r\nI appealed to the Government of the United Kingdom \r\nto rectify the grave injustice it inflicted upon the \r\nPalestinian people when, in 1917, it issued the Balfour \r\nDeclaration, promising Jews a national homeland in \r\nPalestine, despite the fact that Palestine was inhabited \r\nby the Palestinian people. Some 97 per cent of the \r\npopulation of Palestine at that time were Palestinians, \r\nwho were disregarded. Again, Palestine at that time was \r\ninhabited by the Palestinian people and was among the \r\nmost progressive and prosperous countries in the region. \r\nIt should not have been colonized or placed under the \r\nmandate of a great Power. The British Government has \r\nnot taken a single step to date to correct this historical \r\ninjustice against our people. It should apologize, \r\nprovide us with reparations and recognize the State of \r\nPalestine. We talked to its representatives at length and \r\nso far they have not provided a response. What is even \r\nworse is that in November they want to celebrate the \r\ncentenary of this crime against our people.\r\n The silence of the international community with \r\nrespect to Israel’s aggressive policies has emboldened \r\nthe country to continue its policies. I would remind \r\nthe Assembly that, since its establishment, Israel has \r\nviolated numerous provisions of international law. It has \r\nviolated the Charter of the United Nations and continues \r\nto do so. It has violated General Assembly resolutions \r\n181 (II), 194 (III) and Security Council resolution 242 \r\n(1967). We would recall that Article 42 of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations provides for the possible use of \r\nforce to maintain or restore international peace and \r\nsecurity. This could apply to those who conduct acts of \r\naggression against the land of others.\r\nIsrael has taken a large part of our territory and \r\nwas not deterred from doing so by the United Nations. \r\nResolution 194 (III) provided for the return of refugees \r\nat that time. However, the United Nations did not adopt \r\nany follow-up resolution. Security Council resolutions \r\nhave called for withdrawal from the occupied territories. \r\nWhere are those resolutions? If the United Nations \r\ncannot implement its resolutions, who will? Israel does \r\nnot want to. Is Israel above the law? There are double \r\nstandards in dealing with different countries. That is \r\nthe Assembly’s responsibility.\r\nTo salvage the peace process and the two-State \r\nsolution, I urge the Organization and its Member States \r\nto adopt the following measures.\r\nFirst, they should actively pursue efforts to bring \r\nan end to the Israeli occupation of the State of Palestine \r\nwithin a set time frame. It is no longer enough to issue \r\ngeneric statements calling for the end to the occupation \r\nand the achievement of peace without a deadline. \r\nEfforts must be made to implement the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, including a just solution for the Palestinian \r\nrefugee question, in accordance with resolution 194 \r\n(III). The Arab Peace Initiative addressed the issue of \r\nrefugees very well in referring to a just and agreed-\r\nupon solution, not one imposed upon a certain party, in \r\naccordance with resolution 194 (III). Israel disregarded \r\nthose resolutions, riding roughshod over them. To \r\nwhom should we complain?\r\nSecond, they should act to bring to a halt to all \r\nsettlement activities in occupied Palestinian land, as \r\ndemanded in numerous United Nations resolutions, \r\nincluding the most recent Security Council resolution, \r\n2334 (2016), in addition to the operative paragraphs of \r\nthe Fourth Geneva Convention. An occupying Power \r\nshould not expel the people from their land. This is \r\nin the text of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Who is \r\nresponsible for implementing those texts? Israel refuses \r\nto do so. What is the international community doing?\r\nThird, the Organization and Member States should \r\nensure international protection to the lands and people \r\nof the State of Palestine until the occupation ends, \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 11/29\r\nas we are unable to provide protection to our people. \r\nGiven all the forces, the arms that we are facing every \r\nday, who will protect us if the Member States do not? \r\nMany times we have put forward draft resolutions, but \r\nthey are in vain.\r\nFourth, they should demand that Israel endorse \r\nand commit to the borders of 1967 as the basis for \r\nthe two-State solution and set such borders in line \r\nwith international resolutions. Once we delineate the \r\nborders, each party can act in its territory as it pleases \r\nwithout affecting or damaging the rights of the other \r\nparty. Israel builds wherever it wants today, demolishing \r\nhouses every day; even schools and hospitals are being \r\ndemolished. Nobody raises an eyebrow.\r\nFifth, I must ask all the Member States of the \r\nUnited Nations that have recognized Israel to state that \r\nthey have recognized Israel on the basis of the 1967 \r\nborders, thereby aligning themselves with international \r\nresolutions and reaffirming their commitment to those \r\nresolutions — even those who recognized Israel on the \r\nbasis of resolution 181 (II). Resolution 181 (II) was \r\nviolated. Hence my question: where are the borders of \r\nIsrael that Member States are recognizing? How can \r\nMember States recognize a State that has no borders? \r\nIsrael has not even decided on its own borders. Yet \r\ninternational law states that a State is a land with borders. \r\nBut Israel has no borders. How can one recognize a \r\nState that has no clearly demarcated borders?\r\nSixth, I call on all States to end all forms of direct \r\nand indirect involvement with, and support to, the \r\nillegal Israeli colonial settlement regime on the land \r\nof the occupied State of Palestine, in accordance with \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and the affirmed positions \r\nof States in that regard. Such action would be similar \r\nto the international community’s approach to the \r\napartheid regime in South Africa. We should not deal \r\nwith settlements. We should not condone settlements. \r\nThe black list of countries that are dealing illegally \r\nwith Israeli settlements should be exposed.\r\nSeventh, I urge those States that have not yet \r\nrecognized the State of Palestine to do so. I do not \r\nunderstand how recognizing the State of Palestine \r\nwithin the 1967 borders harms the chances of peace. \r\nThere could be minor amendments agreed between the \r\ntwo parties, but the basis is 1967, so our borders are \r\nwell known. Where are the borders of Israel? How can \r\nrecognizing the State of Palestine harm the chances of \r\npeace, especially since we Palestinians have recognized \r\nthe State of Israel within the 1967 borders?\r\nEighth, we look to the Security Council to approve \r\nour application for full membership of the State of \r\nPalestine in the United Nations. What do we lack? \r\nWhat is missing? Every day we prove that we are \r\neligible for such status. All those who support the \r\ntwo-State solution should recognize two States, not \r\none State — Palestine and Israel. If a Member State \r\nrecognizes Israel, it should recognize Palestine.\r\nNinth, we urge the international community to \r\ncontinue providing economic and financial support \r\nto the Palestinian people to achieve self-reliance. If \r\nthe occupation ends we will say “thank you”. We will \r\nbe self-reliant. Unfortunately, because we are under \r\noccupation, we can only seek assistance, and we are \r\ngrateful to the international community because it \r\nis providing assistance. Help us to rid ourselves of \r\nthe occupation, and we will thank Member States for \r\ntheir help.\r\nWe also urge the international community to \r\ncontinue providing support to the United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the \r\nNear East (UNRWA) to enable it to continue providing \r\nhumanitarian assistance. In that connection, we warn \r\nagainst attempts to eliminate item 7 on the agenda of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, or to change the mandate \r\nof UNRWA.\r\nEfforts are also under way to obstruct the issuance \r\nof the list of companies operating in Israeli settlements. \r\nThat is a black list. Why should we hide that list? It is \r\nsimilar to terrorism. Everybody should see the list to \r\nknow who violates international law and who respects \r\nsuch law.\r\nTenth, we once again affirm our commitment to \r\nrespecting human rights and international conventions, \r\nand to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange and all other treaties and conventions that we \r\nhave acceded to. We respect everything that we have \r\nacceded to or adopted, and we go hand in hand with the \r\ninternational community, of which we are part of.\r\nThe State of Palestine will ref lect those \r\nimperatives, where appropriate, in the draft resolutions \r\nto be presented to the General Assembly. We call on the \r\nAssembly to vote in favour of those draft resolutions, \r\nwith the clear aim of preserving the two-State solution, \r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n12/29 17-29395\r\nsalvaging and promoting peace and achieving security \r\nand stability and prosperity for both Israelis and \r\nPalestinians and for the people of the entire region.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to salute our great people, \r\nwho remain steadfast in their homeland despite their \r\nsuffering and peaceful struggle against foreign \r\noccupation. The culture of peace is prevailing among \r\nPalestinians. Those joining Da’esh and the Al-Nusra \r\nFront are not from Palestine.\r\nI salute our people of Jerusalem, who exhibited \r\none of the most shining examples of peaceful popular \r\nresistance against the Israeli colonial occupation. \r\nWhen they were prevented from praying, they prayed \r\noutside — they prayed and were victorious. I salute \r\nour people in exile and in the diaspora. I salute our \r\npeople who remain steadfast in the West Bank and the \r\nbesieged Gaza Strip. I salute our glorious martyrs and \r\nour courageous prisoners in Israeli prisons.\r\nI tell them all that freedom is coming and is \r\ninevitable and that the occupation will come to an end. \r\nThat will come about either with the independence of \r\nthe State of Palestine, living side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity with the State of Israel on the 1967 borders, \r\nor, if Israel chooses, with equal rights for all of the \r\ninhabitants of the land of historic Palestine from the \r\nriver to the sea. Which will they accept?\r\nWhen South Africa was liberated from the apartheid \r\nregime, Nelson Mandela said that he was grateful to the \r\nwhole world and the United Nations, which contributed \r\nto and supported the end of apartheid in South Africa. \r\nMandela added that their victory would not be complete \r\nuntil the Palestinian people were victorious. We, \r\ntogether with the Assembly, are entrusted to end the \r\napartheid in Palestine — person by person, State by \r\nState, including the super-Powers. All of us should stand \r\ntogether. It is a commitment that should be fulfilled. \r\nWill the Assembly fulfil its duty? I very much hope so.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the State of Palestine \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State \r\nof Palestine, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Donald Tusk, President of the \r\nEuropean Council\r\nThe President: The Assembly will hear a statement \r\nby the President of the European Council.\r\nMr. Donald Tusk, President of the European \r\nCouncil, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Donald Tusk, President of the \r\nEuropean Council, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Tusk (European Council): The European \r\nUnion (EU) stands for freedom and a credible rules-\r\nbased global order, because that order is a real sine qua \r\nnon condition for peace, stability and a global economy \r\nthat works for everyone. An alternative to that order \r\nis chaos, which always encourages violence, egoism \r\nand extremism.\r\nThe United Nations is the best tool we have to \r\naddress, on a global scale, today’s conflicts, famine, \r\nforced displacement, terrorism and a return to nuclear \r\ntensions. For the EU and its member States, it is imperative \r\nthat the United Nations rise to those challenges. That is \r\nwhy, together, we contribute approximately one third \r\nof United Nations core financing, make one third of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping contributions and put in \r\nhalf of all voluntary contributions to United Nations \r\nfunds and programmes.\r\nHowever, we also expect the United Nations to \r\nbecome a more energetic and a less bureaucratic \r\nOrganization that can act with clarity and purpose in \r\nall its actions. Therefore, the EU considers the ideas \r\nfor reforming the United Nations currently on the table \r\nas the necessary minimum. What is needed is more \r\nambition, not less.\r\nThe United Nations remains a vital forum for debate \r\nand a tool to implement our collective will, even if it \r\nhas declined in popular esteem in recent years. I take \r\nthe action by the Security Council on 11 September (see \r\nS/PV.8042) to sanction North Korea for carrying out \r\nmore nuclear testing as a sign that the capacity for real \r\nleadership and unity is present. Nevertheless, it is still \r\ntoo little. No country should be allowed to undermine \r\nthe global non-proliferation regime or to threaten \r\npeaceful countries. Together with Japan and South \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 13/29\r\nKorea, our close friends and strategic partners, the \r\nEuropean Union calls for a peaceful denuclearization \r\nof the Korean peninsula. We also call on all concerned \r\nto uphold the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \r\nwith Iran as a multilateral deal that is delivering more \r\nsecurity for us all.\r\nEurope also wants to work in partnership with \r\nAfrican countries on challenges ranging from security \r\nand counter-terrorism to economic growth and job \r\ncreation. We look forward to advancing those goals \r\ntogether at the African-European summit in Ivory Coast \r\nat the end of November. The European Union is already \r\ncooperating closely with United Nations missions \r\non peacekeeping and conflict prevention in Mali, the \r\nCentral African Republic and other conflict zones.\r\nWe are also doing our best to alleviate a major \r\nhumanitarian crisis, affecting more than 20 million \r\npeople, in the Lake Chad basin, South Sudan and \r\nSomalia. Yet more needs to be done. Now is the time to \r\nwake up to those escalating situations before it is really \r\ntoo late.\r\nWhen it comes to the global refugee crisis, the \r\nEU continues to assume its responsibility by receiving \r\npeople in need of protection and by assisting host \r\ncountries closer to the conflict zones. For three years \r\nnow, the EU has appealed to the international community \r\nto take up its responsibility for refugee protection and \r\nirregular migration. I am doing the same today. In that \r\ncontext, the European Union is actively supporting the \r\nUnited Nations process to develop global compacts for \r\nrefugees and for regular, safe and orderly migration. \r\nThe engagement of Member States is needed right now, \r\nboth in terms of money for humanitarian assistance and \r\nmore resettlement for those displaced by conflicts in \r\nSyria, Yemen, Myanmar and especially across Africa.\r\nAt the same time, we should crack down on human \r\nsmugglers, who exploit vulnerable people and violate \r\nsovereign borders. I welcome that the International \r\nCriminal Court Prosecutor is investigating the \r\nsmugglers in Libya for crimes against humanity. \r\nWe should treat them, via a system of international \r\nsanctions, just as harshly as those engaged in terrorism \r\nand piracy. The European Union calls on international \r\nagencies to increase their presence on the ground in \r\nLibya immediately, so that we can work to improve the \r\nsituation of those victimized by the smugglers.\r\nThe year 2017 showed us that Da’esh as a territorial \r\nentity is fated for defeat, which is good news. Sadly, \r\nhowever, repeated terrorist attacks, including in \r\nEurope, demonstrate that the threat continues. We \r\nneed to keep on strengthening the global fight against \r\nterrorism and violent extremism. In short, we must be \r\nmore determined than they are.\r\nDoing more on counter-radicalization within \r\nthe United Nations is badly needed. We welcome the \r\nestablishment by the industry of the Global Internet \r\nForum to Counter Terrorism to work in tandem with \r\nUnited Nations structures. The European Union has \r\ncalled on the major online companies to develop, as a \r\npriority, the means for automatic deletion of extremist \r\ncontent immediately after posting. To the Muslim \r\nleaders of the world, I repeat the appeal I made after \r\nthe London Bridge attack in June: their strong stance \r\nagainst Islamist extremism will be a real support in the \r\nfight against terrorism.\r\nFinally, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \r\nis the cornerstone of global efforts to tackle climate \r\nchange in an effective way and implement the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. The EU remains \r\ndetermined to implement the Agreement swiftly \r\nand fully and to support our partners, in particular \r\nvulnerable countries, in the fight against climate \r\nchange. We will work with all partners that share our \r\nconviction that the Agreement is necessary to protect \r\nour planet, that it is fit for purpose and that, in turn, it \r\nis good for economic growth and future jobs.\r\nWe meet at a time when the world is poised between \r\nhope and fear. The global economy and trade are \r\nexpanding, but security tensions are rising and global \r\ncooperation is being increasingly questioned. Making \r\ninternational action robust, credible and transformative \r\nis the challenge. The European Union will never give \r\nup working with and within the United Nations until we \r\nmeet this challenge.\r\nThe European Union and the United Nations were \r\ncreated in answer to the atrocities of the Second World \r\nWar. That is why our European priority will always be to \r\nreact vigorously against evil, violence and lawlessness \r\nin international life. When confronting evil, the EU and \r\nthe United Nations cannot hesitate.\r\nIn our political life there are situations that are \r\nblack and white and are crystal clear, such as the case \r\nof North Korea’s nuclear blackmail, terrorism, and \r\nthe aggression on Ukraine. It is in such cases that we \r\nneed to demonstrate that we are still able to distinguish \r\nbetween good and evil. Sometimes that takes courage, \r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n14/29 17-29395\r\nbut the United Nations is not there to cowardly look \r\nfor a compromise with evil, but to mobilize the global \r\ncommunity in the fight against it. Therefore a moral \r\njudgment of reality, clear and univocal, should be the \r\nfirst principle of our common action.\r\nMany people in the world still believe that in this \r\nHall have gathered those who have not given up on the \r\nethical dimension of politics in the name of their own \r\negoistic interests. Let us show them that their trust \r\nis justified.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the European Council \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Donald Tusk, President of the European \r\nCouncil, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for General Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for General \r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\r\nMr. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nGeneral Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of the \r\nNetherlands, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Rutte (Netherlands): Every era and every \r\ndecade has its problems, great and small. The problems \r\nwe face now seem overwhelming. These days many \r\npeople worry about the future, which is understandable. \r\nThe past few years have been marked by terrorist \r\nattacks all over the world.\r\nIn countries like Myanmar, Syria, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and Yemen, the population is suffering \r\nas a result of wars and conflicts. More and more people \r\nare f leeing their homes because of violence, scarcity \r\nor poverty, leaving behind everything they have. Only \r\nrecently, f loods claimed lives in the United States and \r\nAsia, and Hurricane Irma has left a trail of destruction \r\nin its wake, including in the Caribbean part of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands. Nuclear issues are once \r\nagain a major concern, and geopolitical tensions are \r\nincreasing.\r\nThat is the picture today. But if we take a long-\r\nterm perspective — and, as a historian, I like to do \r\nthat — there are grounds for optimism. This building \r\nhere in New York — United Nations Headquarters — is \r\nconcrete proof that progress is possible. Here in this \r\ninviolable international zone, thousands of people from \r\nevery continent work together to foster peace, justice \r\nand development in a world governed by international \r\nlaw. That is no easy task, far from it. But advances are \r\nbeing made. Sometimes we take three steps forward \r\nand two steps back, but if one takes a long-term view, \r\none can see clear progress.\r\nThink back to when the United Nations was \r\nestablished in 1945. Europe lay in ruins, as did Asia. \r\nTwo nuclear bombs had been dropped on Japan. The \r\nCold War was around the corner and would hold the \r\nworld in its grip for decades. But the destruction caused \r\nby two world wars united the nations of the world in a \r\nshared belief that it should never happen again.Franklin \r\nD. Roosevelt put it this way in February 1945:\r\n“The point in history at which we stand is full of \r\npromise and of danger. The world will either move \r\ntowards unity and widely shared prosperity or it \r\nwill move apart”.\r\nThe world of today is indeed a much better world, \r\nand not just geopolitically. In 2015 we took stock of the \r\nprogress we had made on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Extreme poverty and maternal mortality had \r\nbeen halved, and child mortality had been almost \r\nhalved. Ninety per cent of children in developing \r\ncountries are now receiving primary education. Despite \r\nall the very real problems that confront us today, I still \r\nsee grounds for optimism. We cannot change the world \r\novernight, but we can improve the lives of individuals \r\nstep by step. And we are doing so.\r\nThe United Nations plays a crucial role in \r\nthose achievements. The United Nations is the only \r\norganization where everyone sits at the table, and \r\nremains there. While other institutions struggle with an \r\nincreasing lack of credibility, faith in the added value \r\nof the United Nations remains strong among the world’s \r\ncitizens. We must not let them down.\r\nThe Netherlands and its Kingdom partners \r\nCuraçao, Aruba and Sint Maarten have always attached \r\ngreat importance to cooperation within the United \r\nNations. Our small, outward-looking kingdom could \r\nnot exist without strong multilateral institutions and \r\nan effective international legal order. As a trading \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 15/29\r\nnation, our prosperity depends on a stable world. And \r\nafter the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 disaster and \r\nattacks in neighbouring countries, the people of the \r\nNetherlands are increasingly aware that our domestic \r\nsecurity depends on cooperation with other countries. \r\nIt is very important to the Netherlands and to the \r\nvictims’ next of kin that justice is seen to be done for \r\nthose who perished on Flight MH-17. It has been agreed \r\nthat the next step — the prosecution and trial of those \r\nresponsible — will take place in the Netherlands. We \r\nare working with all the countries involved to make \r\nthat possible.\r\nThe problems confronting today’s world — climate \r\nchange, migration, food security, terrorism and \r\ncybercrime — are by definition international. No single \r\ncountry can tackle them in isolation. We need each \r\nother. Instead of becoming more inward-looking, as \r\nunited nations we need to take a step outwards. In this \r\nturbulent world, the importance of the United Nations \r\nis growing every day.\r\nNext year, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will \r\nbe even more focused on the United Nations. In \r\nJanuary 2018, we begin our one-year term on the \r\nSecurity Council, taking over from Italy. This shared \r\narrangement is a good example of European partnership \r\nwithin international organizations. We would like to \r\nsee more such cooperation. Our two countries even \r\nshare some of the same priorities, such as tackling \r\npeople-smuggling in Libya, an issue that is of great \r\nconcern to the whole of Europe.\r\nFor next year, as a temporary member of the \r\nSecurity Council, we have set three priorities: a strong \r\nUnited Nations and a secure and sustainable world. We \r\nwill work in a transparent way to achieve that goal, \r\neach element of which is equally important.\r\nThe first priority, a strong United Nations, is \r\nessential. For that, reform and modernization are \r\ncrucial. As the new Secretary-General, António \r\nGuterres, has said, “The onus falls on the United \r\nNations to prove its worth”. He has been active from \r\nday one, working to adapt the United Nations to new \r\nrealities. His ambitious agenda inspires confidence for \r\nthe future. The Kingdom of the Netherlands supports \r\nhis vision and approach, and I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to call for a joint effort to implement his \r\nreform plans. It is time to follow through. And I do not \r\nonly mean the Secretary-General, but all of us here in \r\nthis great Hall. Saying that the onus falls on the United \r\nNations means that the onus falls on us.\r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands wants to see a \r\nmore effective and efficient United Nations, with better \r\ncooperation among the various agencies. After all, the \r\nfields in which the United Nations is active — human \r\nrights, peace and security, and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) — are all inextricably \r\nlinked. The Netherlands already works in this way. We \r\ncall it the 3-D approach: an integrated effort to tackle \r\ndevelopment, defence and diplomacy.\r\nWe would also like to see the role of the Resident \r\nCoordinator reinforced. Moreover, the United Nations \r\nwill have to work in a results-oriented way, adopt a \r\nmore modern personnel policy and bolster its internal \r\ntransparency and accountability. Those are all issues \r\nthat we will press for in the coming period.\r\nOur second priority next year is of course \r\nsecurity. The key word here is “prevention”. We are \r\nnot devoting enough attention to the early stages of \r\nconflict development. That has to change. We need an \r\norganization equipped and ready for action at all stages \r\nof conflict. That is already happening in the United \r\nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \r\nMission in Mali (MINUSMA), in which the Netherlands \r\nis participating and will continue to participate in 2018. \r\nWhat is new is that we are using intelligence to carry \r\nout long-range reconnaissance missions. In that way, \r\nwe can anticipate conflict, instead of waiting for it to \r\ncome our way.\r\nWe see MINUSMA as a model for future missions. \r\nHowever, we need not only better intelligence, but also \r\ntask-oriented training for United Nations personnel, \r\nhigh-grade equipment and a clear mandate. This year \r\nthe Kingdom of the Netherlands is co-organizing the \r\nUnited Nations Peacekeeping Conference in Vancouver. \r\nThere, we will press for rotation schedules to ensure \r\ntimely deployment and rotation of both personnel \r\nand materiel. That will make countries more willing \r\nto participate and extend the potential lifespan of \r\na mission.\r\nCounter-terrorism is another issue on which the \r\nUnited Nations is rightly focusing more and more. \r\nAfter all, the United Nations is the prime forum for \r\nglobal norm-setting and international cooperation \r\nin the field. When it comes to preventing terrorism, \r\ncooperation is key. A good example of such cooperation \r\nis the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum (GCTF), which \r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n16/29 17-29395\r\nthe Netherlands co-chairs together with Morocco. \r\nThere, 29 countries work together to achieve a single \r\ngoal: to keep our citizens safe. It is producing concrete \r\nresults. For instance, at least 60 countries and the \r\nUnited Nations now contribute foreign terrorist profiles \r\nto INTERPOL. INTERPOL already has over 16,000 \r\nprofiles. When the GCTF was set up, it had fewer than \r\n1,000. That work is not high profile — most of it goes \r\non behind the scenes — but it saves many lives.\r\nThe prevention of violence and conflict ties in \r\nwith our third priority — sustainability — and with \r\nit, the implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. The SDGs precede everything I have just \r\ndiscussed. They are the ultimate prevention agenda. \r\nThey address the drivers and root causes of instability \r\nand conflict. Investing in human dignity, eradicating \r\npoverty, fostering climate resilience and promoting \r\neconomic and social progress will reduce the incidence \r\nof conflict, instability and despair — development and \r\nlasting peace, all in one package.\r\nThe Netherlands and its Kingdom partners \r\nCuraçao, Aruba and Sint Maarten are working together \r\nto implement the SDGs. We believe that the key to \r\nsuccess in attaining the Goals is our willingness to \r\nform partnerships at the national and international \r\nlevels with businesses, civil society organizations, \r\nknowledge institutions, local authorities and youth \r\norganizations. Working together across sectors is part \r\nof our country’s tradition.\r\nOur most important area of expertise is water \r\nmanagement. Much of the Netherlands lies below sea \r\nlevel, so we have centuries of experience in water \r\ntechnology, urban delta management and maritime \r\ntechnology, expertise that we are keen to share with the \r\nrest of the world. Working together on water issues is \r\nmore crucial than ever before. Nearly five years have \r\nelapsed since thousands of people here in New York had \r\nto f lee their homes when the streets f looded in the wake \r\nof Hurricane Sandy. The destruction caused by Harvey \r\nin Texas and the f loods in Asia show that water issues \r\nhave only become more urgent in the last five years.\r\nThe impact of climate change on the water cycle \r\nis brought home to us every day, all over the world, \r\nsometimes violently. The people of Sint Maarten, in the \r\nCaribbean part of the Kingdom, are struggling to cope \r\nwith the devastation caused by Hurricane Irma.\r\nThe United Nations now predicts that 200 million \r\npeople will have become displaced by 2050 because \r\nof climate change. Water therefore plays a key role in \r\nachieving almost all of the SDGs. We learn most by \r\nworking with others and by sharing knowledge. We \r\ndeploy our expertise all over the world — for example, in \r\nprojects in Viet Nam, Peru, Myanmar and Bangladesh. \r\nThat is one of the reasons that I am a member of the \r\nHigh-level Panel on Water.\r\nThis Hall, this building and all members of the \r\nAssembly represent one of the greatest achievements \r\nof humankind: all the nations working together in \r\npartnership to foster peace, justice and development \r\nin the world. This is a unique Organization, which \r\nentails a heavy responsibility. In such turbulent times, \r\nthe United Nations needs to prove its worth more than \r\never. Adlai Stevenson, an American politician who \r\nexperienced two world wars and died when the Cold \r\nWar was at its height, once said,\r\n“The United Nations is like a spade; it is not self-\r\noperating. It is what we make of it, for purposes \r\nthat we can find in common with our neighbours \r\nin the world.”\r\nI could not agree more. We face great problems in \r\nthe present age. Conflict and natural disasters affect \r\nthe lives of many and cause widespread concern. In \r\nthis unstable world, the United Nations represents \r\nstability and a chance to shape the world for the good. \r\nWe need to make progress with the reforms proposed \r\nby Secretary-General Guterres. Let us consider what \r\nwe have achieved in recent decades. As they say, past \r\nresults are no guarantee of future performance, but \r\nthey do represent a promise for the future. Let us do all \r\nwe can to make good on that promise, because together \r\nwe can make the United Nations a success. In the year \r\nahead, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will commit \r\nitself fully to that endeavour.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nGeneral Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nGeneral Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of \r\nJapan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Japan.\r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 17/29\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of \r\nJapan, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Abe (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): I had intended to begin \r\ntoday by speaking of the sincerity with which Japan \r\nis implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nand I hoped to introduce the innovative ways by which \r\nwe have been fostering public awareness of those Goals \r\nwithin Japan. I wanted to explain why the Women \r\nEntrepreneurs Finance Initiative is important to me \r\npersonally and to the Government of Japan. I have been \r\nsaying we will make universal health coverage part of \r\nthe Japan brand, and in December we will hold a major \r\nconference in Tokyo with that theme.\r\nThe list of points I would have liked to raise here \r\nis long indeed — our contributions towards the rule of \r\nlaw, our determination to be steadfast in undertaking \r\nthe Paris Agreement and our policy of addressing global \r\ninfrastructure demand through quality investments. \r\nMoreover, what Japan wants to safeguard in every \r\nrespect is the free, liberal, open international order and \r\nmultilateral frameworks.\r\nThe world certainly holds high expectations towards \r\nthe United Nations as the f lag-bearer upholding those \r\nvalues. That is exactly why the Security Council should \r\nbe reformed without delay, in response to the demands \r\nof the times. Japan will strive, together with its friends, \r\nto achieve such reforms. I had intended to state that \r\nJapan’s abiding determination is to play an active role \r\nfor world peace as a permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil. However, I have no choice but to focus my \r\nremarks on a single issue, that of North Korea.\r\nNorth Korea conducted a nuclear test on 3 September. \r\nWhether or not it was a hydrogen bomb test, its scale far \r\nexceeded that of previous tests. Before and after that, on \r\n29 August and again on 15 September — before the ink \r\nwas even dry on Security Council resolution 2375 (2017), \r\nadopted to impose sanctions on North Korea — North \r\nKorea launched missiles. They were launched to f ly \r\nover Japan and make a display of their cruising range. \r\nThe gravity of that threat is unprecedented, and it \r\nis indisputably a matter of urgency. North Korea is \r\nattempting to dismiss with a smirk the efforts towards \r\ndisarmament we have assiduously undertaken over the \r\nyears. The non-proliferation regime is about to suffer \r\na serious blow from its most confident disrupter ever.\r\nQualitatively, that recent crisis is of an altogether \r\ndifferent dimension than those we have eluded every \r\ntime that some dictator has attempted to acquire \r\nweapons of mass destruction. North Korea’s nuclear \r\nweapons either already are, or are on the verge of \r\nbecoming, hydrogen bombs. Their means of delivery \r\nwill sooner or later be intercontinental ballistic missile. \r\nOver more than 20 years since the end of the Cold War, \r\nwhere and when else, and to what dictators, have we \r\nallowed such self-indulgence? As it turns out, it is only \r\ntowards North Korea that it has been allowed. That is \r\nthe reality we find before us, and it was absolutely not a \r\nlack of dialogue that gave rise to the situation.\r\nDialogue dissuaded North Korea from pursuing its \r\nnuclear ambitions. Dialogue has afforded many of us \r\nthe relief that the world had been saved from a crisis. \r\nBelieving thus, many of us were relieved — not just \r\nonce, but twice. The first time was in the early 1990s. At \r\nthe time, the threat that North Korea imposed amounted \r\nto little more than openly displaying its withdrawal \r\nfrom the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \r\nand other inspection regimes. However, tensions were \r\nfelt by those of us that surmised the intent of that.\r\nAfter many twists and turns, in October 1994 \r\nwhat is known as the Agreed Framework was realized \r\nbetween the United States and North Korea. Under that \r\nframework, North Korea would be made to abandon its \r\nnuclear plans. In exchange, we would provide incentives \r\nto North Korea. To that end, Japan, the United States, \r\nand the Republic of Korea formed the Korean Peninsula \r\nEnergy Development Organization (KEDO) in March \r\nthe following year.\r\nTaking KEDO as the implementing agent, we \r\npledged to build and hand over two light-water reactors \r\nto North Korea and to provide 500,000 tons of heavy \r\nfuel oil annually as a stopgap measure for its energy \r\ndemand. Those steps were all carried out accordingly. \r\nHowever, as time went by, it came to be known that \r\nNorth Korea had been continuing steadily with its \r\nuranium enrichment.\r\nFrom the start, North Korea had never intended to \r\nabandon its nuclear ambitions. That had become readily \r\napparent to all. After 2002, seven years after it was \r\nfounded, KEDO suspended its operations. During that \r\nperiod, it can be said that North Korea defrauded the \r\nUnited States, the Republic of Korea and Japan with \r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n18/29 17-29395\r\nregard to assistance. Countries that recognized value \r\nin the KEDO framwork of providing incentives to \r\nchange North Korea’s actions gradually came to join \r\nKEDO: the European Union, New Zealand, Australia, \r\nCanada, Indonesia, Chile, Argentina, Poland, the Czech \r\nRepublic and Uzbekistan. North Korea betrayed the \r\ngood faith of all those KEDO members. As one of the \r\norganization’s founding members, Japan had pledged \r\nto give a non-interest loan to KEDO and had fulfilled \r\nroughly 40 per cent of that pledge — that is, about \r\n$400 million of a $1 billion pledge.\r\nThe second crisis occurred in 2002, when \r\nKEDO suspended its operations and North Korea, \r\nsaying it would end the freeze on its nuclear-related \r\nfacilities, expelled IAEA inspectors. The concern was \r\nagain that North Korea was continuing its uranium \r\nenrichment — and again we chose the path of defusing \r\nthe situation through dialogue.\r\nNorth Korea, China, and Russia joined the three \r\nfounding members of KEDO — Japan, the United \r\nStates and the Republic of Korea — to launch the \r\nSix-Party Talks in August 2003. Subsequently, after \r\ntwo years of twists and turns through the summer of \r\n2005 into autumn, the six parties finally reached an \r\nagreement resulting in the release of a joint statement. \r\nNorth Korea committed to abandoning all nuclear \r\nweapons and existing nuclear programmes and to \r\nreturning to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons and to IAEA safeguards. Moreover, \r\ntwo years later, in February 2007, an agreement was \r\nconcluded regarding what each of the six parties should \r\ndo towards implementing the joint statement. A group \r\nof IAEA inspectors that had entered North Korea \r\nverified the shutdown of the nuclear-related facilities \r\nin Yongbyon, and in return North Korea received heavy \r\nfuel oil.\r\nThe series of events made people think that, this \r\ntime, tenaciously continuing dialogue had finally \r\ncaused North Korea to change its actions. But what \r\nactually happened? In February 2005, while the Six-\r\nParty Talks were under way, North Korea declared \r\nunilaterally that it was already in possession of nuclear \r\nweapons. Moreover, in October 2006, it openly carried \r\nout its first nuclear test. Its second nuclear test was in \r\n2009. Finally, that same year, North Korea announced \r\nits withdrawal from the Six-Party Talks, stating it \r\nwould never again take part in such talks. It was \r\naround that time that it was firing ballistic missiles on \r\na repeated basis.\r\nOver the course of more than a decade, beginning \r\nin 1994, the international community continued its \r\nefforts for dialogue with North Korea with great \r\nperseverance, first through the Agreed Framework \r\nand later through the Six-Party Talks. However, what \r\nwe had to learn is that during the time that dialogue \r\ncontinued, North Korea had no intention whatsoever \r\nof abandoning its nuclear or missile development. For \r\nNorth Korea, dialogue was instead the best means of \r\ndeceiving us and buying time. More than anything else, \r\nthe following fact demonstrates that. In 1994, North \r\nKorea had no nuclear weapons, and even its ballistic \r\nmissile technology was far from mature. Yet it is now \r\nworking to attain hydrogen bombs and intercontinental \r\nballistic missiles. Again and again, attempts to resolve \r\nissues through dialogue have all come to nought.\r\nWith what hope of success are we repeating the very \r\nsame failure a third time? We must make North Korea \r\nabandon all nuclear and ballistic missile programmess \r\nin a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. What \r\nis needed to do that is not dialogue, but pressure.\r\nOn 15 November, 40 years will have passed since \r\na 13 year old girl named Megumi Yokota was abducted \r\nby North Korea. Megumi and many other abducted \r\nJapanese remain in North Korea even to this day. I \r\nwill continue all possible efforts so they can set foot \r\non Japan’s soil as soon as possible. I will continue until \r\nthe day when they will finally be in the arms of their \r\nparents and their family members. Japan will face up \r\nto North Korea’s nuclear and missile threat through the \r\nJapan-United States alliance and through Japan, the \r\nUnited States and the Republic of Korea acting in unity. \r\nWe consistently support the stance of the United States \r\nthat all options are on the table.\r\nAlso, I appreciate the Security Council’s \r\nunanimous adoption, on 11 September, of resolution \r\n2375 (2017), which imposes strict sanctions against \r\nNorth Korea. That clarified our intention to further \r\nintensify pressure on North Korea in order to force it \r\nto undertake a fundamental change in its path forward. \r\nBut I must make an appeal to the General Assembly. \r\nNorth Korea has already demonstrated its disregard of \r\nthe resolution by launching yet another missile.\r\nThe resolution is nothing more than the beginning. \r\nWe must prevent the goods, funds, people, and technology \r\nnecessary for nuclear and missile development from \r\nheading to North Korea. We must make North Korea \r\ncomply fully with the repeated resolutions. We must \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 19/29\r\nensure the strict and full implementation of the \r\nseries of Security Council resolutions by all United \r\nNations States Members. What is necessary is action. \r\nWhether or not we can put an end to the provocations \r\nby North Korea is dependent upon the solidarity of the \r\ninternational community. There is not much time left.\r\nNorth Korea is in a truly fortunate location, \r\nadjoining the growth region of Asia and the Pacific. It \r\nhas an industrious labour force as well as underground \r\nresources. If it were to make use of those, there could \r\nbe a path for North Korea to dramatically grow its \r\neconomy and improve public welfare. That is where \r\nNorth Korea’s bright future lies. By failing to resolve \r\nthe abduction, nuclear weapon and missile issues \r\nand by becoming a threat to all humankind, there is \r\nabsolutely no future that North Korea can open up for \r\nitself. In order to change North Korea’s policies, we \r\nmust strengthen our unity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Japan for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. António Luís Santos da Costa, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Portugal\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Portugal.\r\nMr. António Luís Santos da Costa, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Portugal, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. António Luís Santos da Costa, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic ofPortugal, and inviting \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Da Costa (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Let me start \r\nby expressing Portugal’s condolences to and solidarity \r\nwith the people and the Government of Mexico for \r\nyesterday’s violent tragedy.\r\nI wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on \r\nyour election. I welcome the priorities that you have \r\nestablished. Portugal fully supports an agenda centred \r\naround people and the right that we all have to live \r\na dignified life in peace on a sustainable planet. I \r\nalso wish to express a word of appreciation to your \r\npredecessor, whose dedication and successes we most \r\nreadily acknowledge.\r\nI feel deeply moved to address the peoples’ \r\nAssembly today in the presence of the first Portuguese \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations. Before the \r\nAssembly, I solemnly pledge Portugal’s commitment \r\nto the United Nations and multilateralism, founded on \r\nthe primacy of international law and the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe priorities of the Secretary-General are the \r\nsame as ours: for a United Nations that is stronger, \r\noffers greater solidarity and is capable of preventing \r\nconflicts, alleviating human suffering and promoting \r\npeace and prosperity — a more transparent United \r\nNations that is more effective and more adaptable to \r\na constantly changing world. We welcome and support \r\nthe dynamism that he has shown right from the start \r\nof his mandate in reforming the United Nations system \r\nso that it may better fulfil its noble purpose. Only the \r\nUnited Nations holds a universal vocation to respond, \r\nin concert with Member States, to the increasingly \r\ncomplex challenges of our time.\r\nReforming the peace and security architecture \r\nis an absolute priority. Consolidating a culture of \r\nconflict prevention requires action across the board \r\nand an integrated vision of the three pillars of the \r\nUnited Nations system — peace, human rights \r\nand sustainable development — as well as closer \r\ninstitutional cooperation among the principal organs of \r\nthe Charter, particularly the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAchieving sustainable peace will require greater \r\nsynergies in the Organization’s structures and missions \r\non the ground. The ongoing efforts should also give fresh \r\nimpetus to reform of the Security Council to ensure \r\nbetter representation of today’s world. The African \r\ncontinent cannot be denied a permanent presence, while \r\nBrazil and India are also two inescapable examples of \r\nnecessart representation.\r\nOn the other hand, the complexity of the global \r\nproblems we face requires us to foster partnerships, \r\ninvolving not only States but also civil societies, \r\ninternational financial institutions and public and \r\nprivate entities. In that connection, I recall resolution \r\n71/324, on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, \r\nadopted a few days ago, which specifically aims to \r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n20/29 17-29395\r\nstrengthen the complementarities between the two \r\norganizations.\r\nI would also like to underscore the importance of the \r\nPortuguese language, which is today an instrument of \r\ncommunication with a global dimension. By the middle \r\nof this century, there will be almost 400 million speakers \r\nof the Portuguese language. That is what justified its \r\nadoption as an official language in several international \r\norganizations. The acceptance of Portuguese as one of \r\nthe official languages of the United Nations remains a \r\ncommon stance of the member States of the Community \r\nof Portuguese-speaking Countries.\r\nThe Secretary-General has chosen diplomacy for \r\npeace as one of the main f lags of his mandate. This idea \r\nmust guide us as an international community as we react \r\nto the conflicts and crises that regrettably occur today \r\nin various parts of the world. The unity and firmness \r\nof the international community, embodied in the \r\nUnited Nations, in defence of law and in the promotion \r\nof security and stability is what enables us to move \r\ntowards a fairer international order and to find the best \r\nsolutions to the serious crises we face today — from \r\nNorth Korean threats to the situation in Syria, from the \r\ninstability in Libya to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\nand so many other sources of confrontation, security \r\nrisks or humanitarian tragedy.\r\nTerrorism is a global threat that challenges all of \r\nus. Portugal strongly and unequivocally condemns \r\nall acts of terrorism and emphasizes the importance \r\nof preventing and fighting radicalization, violent \r\nextremism and recruitment. It actively participates \r\nin the struggle against terrorism, notably within the \r\nframework of the Global Coalition against Da’esh. We \r\nwelcome the military successes achieved in Iraq over \r\nthe past year.\r\nWe all know that promoting peace and security \r\ngoes hand in hand with promoting development. The \r\ntwo dimensions complement and strengthen each other. \r\nFor that reason, diplomatic mediation efforts and peace \r\noperations in conflict zones also require humanitarian \r\nsupport, development cooperation and institutional \r\ncapacity-building for affected populations and States.\r\nOne of the clearest priorities of Portuguese foreign \r\npolicy is participation in peacekeeping operations and \r\ninstitution-building within the framework of the United \r\nNations. As a European and Atlantic country with \r\ndeep historical and cultural links to Africa, Portugal \r\npays particular attention to partnerships between the \r\ntwo continents.\r\nThe first Summit between Europe and Africa took \r\nplace in 2000, under the Portuguese presidency of the \r\nEuropean Union. The fifth European Union-African \r\nUnion Summit, to be held in Abidjan in November, \r\nwill be an excellent opportunity to better define the \r\npriorities of the strategic partnership between the \r\nEuropean Union and the African continent. The chosen \r\ntheme — Youth — allows a much-needed integrated \r\napproach that addresses issues of education and \r\nemployment, demographic dynamics and economic \r\ngrowth, gender equality and civic participation.\r\nThe African continent has made important progress \r\nin recent years. We welcome the strengthening of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the African \r\nUnion. There are many signs of hope, both politically \r\nand economically. The successful implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will be \r\nanother important step in that sense.\r\nHowever, several disturbing issues still need to be \r\novercome, and Portugal strives to do its part. First, we \r\nparticipate in various peacekeeping and stabilization \r\noperations within the framework of the United \r\nNations and the European Union. In that way, we have \r\nreinforced our presence, without ever restricting the \r\nuse of our troops, in the multilateral missions in the \r\nSahel and Central Africa region, namely, the United \r\nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \r\nMissions in Mali and in the Central African Republic. \r\nSecondly, Portugal cooperates with several African \r\npartners in promoting maritime security, particularly in \r\nthe Gulf of Guinea, to combat piracy and trafficking in \r\npeople, drugs and weapons and to protect international \r\ntrade from a strategic point of view for both Africa \r\nand Europe.\r\nPeace and sustainable development are built on \r\nrespect for the rights and dignity of human beings. \r\nPortugal defends human rights diplomacy. For us, \r\ncivil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are \r\ninseparable and interdependent. They apply universally \r\nand do not depend on place, history or the religious \r\nor civilizational matrix of a society. Upholding those \r\nrights is a task for all of us, one which requires dialogue \r\nand concerted action. That is the only way human rights \r\nwill be made universal. Our mandate in the Human \r\nRights Council, which ends this year, was guided by \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 21/29\r\nthose principles, and they will continue to guide us in \r\nthe future.\r\nIn 2017, we celebrate 150 years since the abolition \r\nof the death penalty in Portugal. We have been pioneers \r\nin that cause and will continue to stand for the universal \r\nabolition of capital punishment.\r\nThe situation of migrants and refugees remains \r\non the agenda. We have a moral obligation to protect \r\nand promote the rights of those who, like so many \r\nothers before them, are forced to leave their homes and \r\nfamilies in search of security and a better future. That \r\nis the principle that should serve as the basis for the \r\nglobal compact that last year we pledged to prepare and \r\napprove.\r\nIn that context, I underline the work of the Global \r\nPlatform for Syrian Students, an initiative of the former \r\nPresident of Portugal, Jorge Sampaio. The Platform \r\nguarantees access to higher education for young \r\nSyrians who, because of the conflict in their country, \r\nhave been deprived of that universal right. I invite all \r\ncountries that have not yet done so to join the Platform \r\nand support the Rapid Response Mechanism for Higher \r\nEducation in Emergencies. The war cannot lead to the \r\nloss of yet another generation of Syrian youth, who \r\nhave the right to education.\r\nFor peace and development to be truly sustainable, \r\nwe must show respect for our common home and future \r\ngenerations. To protect and preserve the planet is to \r\nnurture peace and prevent new conflicts that are caused \r\nby competition in accessing diminishing resources. \r\nIn that regard, the Paris Agreement is a milestone in \r\nreducing the impacts of climate change. We cannot do \r\nwithout the universal instrument if we are to achieve \r\nthe objectives of the environmental pillar of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nPortugal will comply with the European Union’s \r\nvoluntary commitment to reducing greenhouse gas \r\nemissions by 40 per cent by 2030, as compared to 1990 \r\nlevels, and will contribute to the Green Climate Fund, \r\nwhich is in place to help developing countries adapt to \r\nclimate change.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals are the most powerful statement of our multilateral \r\ncommitment to the rights of people, the quality of life \r\nof populations and the future of our planet. Portugal \r\nstands for those Goals, which guide us both in our \r\ndomestic policy and in our foreign and cooperation \r\nefforts. All 17 Goals are very important to us. However, \r\nbecause of our history and the international action on \r\nthe preservation and enhancement of marine resources, \r\nwe believe that Goal 14, on oceans, is the one to which \r\nour participation can bring greater added value, within \r\nthe framework of the United Nations.\r\nOceans — source of life, knowledge and so many \r\nresources and exchanges — make up 71 per cent of \r\nthe surface of our planet and are a top priority in any \r\nstrategy for sustainable development. The need for \r\naction is pressing and wide-ranging, as was evident \r\na week ago in Lisbon in another oceans meeting, this \r\nyear dedicated to the theme “The Ocean and Human \r\nHealth”. It was promoted by Portugal, and dozens of \r\ncountries participated.\r\nIn 2017, the first United Nations conference \r\ndedicated to conservation and sustainable exploitation \r\nof the oceans took place. It was a privilege for Portugal to \r\nparticipate in the preparatory process for the conference \r\nas co-facilitator, along with Singapore, of the political \r\ndocument that resulted from it: “Our ocean, our future: \r\ncall for action”. I reiterate my country’s willingness to \r\nhost the follow-up conference in 2020.\r\nIn our view, the sustainability of oceans requires \r\na strengthening of their governance. For that reason, \r\nwe believe that the General Assembly should formally \r\ndecide on the beginning of negotiations, starting in \r\n2018, of a new legally binding instrument for the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity \r\nin areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\r\nHowever many the challenges we face today and \r\nhowever serious the risks and threats that aff lict us, we \r\nare certain to make progress when we have clear goals \r\nand know how to establish partnerships to reach them. \r\nMultilateralism is the only framework for the defence \r\nof the common good of humankind and the collective \r\npromotion of peace, security and development. In no \r\nway does multilateralism diminish the sovereignty \r\nof nations or the capacity for decisions of peoples \r\nand institutions. The fraternal cooperation promoted \r\nby multilateralism contributes to our strengths with \r\nthe strengths of those who follow the same path \r\nand direction.\r\nWe know the way and direction to take. Our way \r\nis that of the United Nations and our direction is the \r\nagenda of the United Nations. Diplomacy for peace, \r\ndiplomacy for human rights, the climate agenda, the \r\n2030 Agenda — my country is part of and contributes \r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n22/29 17-29395\r\nto all of them for the sake of humanity, which is our \r\ncommon condition.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nPortugal for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. António Luís Santos da Costa, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Portugal, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Theresa May, Prime Minister \r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nMrs. Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Theresa May, Prime Minister of the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nand inviting her to address the General Assembly.\r\nMrs. May (United Kingdom): I would like to \r\nbegin by expressing my sincere condolences to the \r\nGovernment and the people of Mexico following the \r\ndevastating earthquake. I also want to reiterate my \r\nsympathies to those affected by the recent hurricanes \r\nin the Caribbean. Our thoughts are with them all at \r\nthis time.\r\n As we meet at the General Assembly, we face \r\nchallenges that go right to the heart of who we are as \r\nnations — challenges that test our values, our vision \r\nand our resolve to defend the rules and standards that \r\nunderpin the security and prosperity of our fellow \r\ncitizens. As I argued in my speech here last year (see \r\nA/71/PV.8), many of those challenges do not recognize \r\nor respect geographical boundaries.\r\nI think, of course, of the terrorism that has struck \r\nso many of our countries — including my own, five \r\ntimes this year —and, fuelling that terrorist threat, \r\nof the increasing numbers being drawn to extremist \r\nideologies, not only in places riven by conflict and \r\ninstability but many online in their homes, thousands \r\nof miles away from those conflicts. I think of climate \r\nchange, which is depleting and degrading the planet we \r\nleave to our children. And I think of the vast challenges \r\nthat come from the mass displacement of people. Many \r\nare refugees f leeing conflict and persecution. Others \r\nare economic migrants prepared to risk everything \r\non perilous sea crossings in the desperate search for a \r\nbetter life for themselves and their children.\r\nThrough that migration we also see the challenges \r\nof economic inequality, between countries and within \r\nthem. That inequality, together with weaknesses in the \r\nglobal trading system, threatens to undermine support \r\nfor the forces of liberalism and free trade that have done \r\nso much to propel global growth, and it is pushing some \r\ncountries towards protectionism in the belief that that \r\nbest defends the interests of their own people.\r\nAs the global system struggles to adapt, we are \r\nconfronted by States deliberately f louting, for their \r\nown gain, the rules and standards that have secured our \r\ncollective prosperity and security — the unforgivable \r\nuse of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime against \r\nits own people and, perhaps foremost in our minds \r\ntoday, the outrageous proliferation of nuclear weapons \r\nby North Korea and a threat to use them.\r\nI believe that the only way for us to respond to that \r\nvast array of challenges is to come together and defend \r\nthe international order that we have worked so hard to \r\ncreate and the values by which we stand. For it is the \r\nfundamental values that we share, values of fairness, \r\njustice and human rights, that have created the common \r\ncause among nations to act together in our shared \r\ninterests and form the multilateral system. It is that \r\nrules-based system that we have developed — including \r\nthe institutions, the international frameworks of free \r\nand fair trade, agreements such as the Paris Climate \r\nAgreement, and laws and conventions like the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons — that \r\nenables a global cooperation through which we can \r\nprotect those values.\r\nIndeed, the defining purposes set out in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations are to maintain international \r\npeace and security, to develop friendly relations \r\namong nations, to achieve international cooperation in \r\nsolving the problems of an economic, social, cultural \r\nand humanitarian character, and to be a centre for \r\nharmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of \r\nthose common ends. I do not see those as vaunted ideals \r\nto be held to their own sake. Those values and the rules \r\nthey imbue are central to our national interest, to our \r\nsecurity and prosperity. The international system, with \r\nthe United Nations at its heart, is the amplifying force \r\nthat enables countries to cooperate and live up to those \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 23/29\r\nstandards in word, spirit and deed, to our collective and \r\nindividual benefit.\r\nIf the system we have created is found no longer \r\nto be capable of meeting the challenges of our time, \r\nthen there will be a crisis of faith in multilateralism and \r\nglobal cooperation that will damage the interests of all \r\nour peoples. Those of us who hold true to our shared \r\nvalues, who hold true to that desire to defend the rules \r\nand high standards that have shaped and protected the \r\nworld we live in, need to strive harder than ever to show \r\nthat institutions like the United Nations can work for \r\nthe countries that formed them and for the people who \r\nwe represent.\r\nThat means reforming the United Nations and the \r\nwider international system so it can prove its worth in \r\nhelping us to meet the challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. It also means ensuring that those who flout \r\nthe rules and spirit of our international system are held \r\nto account, that nations honour their responsibilities \r\nand play their part in upholding and renewing a rules-\r\nbased international order that can deliver prosperity \r\nand security for us all.\r\nFirst, we must insure that our multilateral \r\ninstitutions can deliver the aspirations on which they \r\nwere founded. Think of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees looking after those who \r\nhave been driven out of their homes; the Organization \r\nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons striving for \r\na world free of chemical weapons; the United Nations \r\nChildren’s Fund helping children in danger. Those are \r\nall vital missions where the United Nations surely has \r\na unique role to play. That is why the United Kingdom \r\nhas over 70 years been such a pioneering supporter of \r\nthose organizations, and more.\r\nBut we should also acknowledge that throughout \r\nits history the United Nations has suffered from a \r\nseemingly unbridgeable gap between the nobility \r\nof its purposes and the effectiveness of its delivery. \r\nWhen the need for multilateral action has never been \r\ngreater, the shortcomings of the United Nations and its \r\ninstitutions risk undermining the confidence of States \r\nas Members and donors. Even more important, they \r\nrisk the confidence and faith of those who rely on the \r\nBlue Helmets, who rely on that sign I stand in front of \r\ntoday to come to their aid in the darkest of hours.\r\nWe must begin by supporting the ambitious \r\nreform agenda that Secretary-General Guterres is \r\nnow leading to create a more agile, transparent and \r\njoined-up Organization. Much of the work will be \r\npractical and unglamorous. It will require the United \r\nNations to deliver better cooperation on the ground \r\nbetween agencies, remove competition for funding and \r\nimprove gender equality. But it will also require real \r\nleadership to confront damaging issues that have beset \r\nthe United Nations. I therefore welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s new circle of leadership on preventing sexual \r\nexploitation and abuse in United Nations operations, \r\nand I am pleased to be part of that initiative.\r\nWe, the nations of the United Nations, need to \r\ngive the Secretary-General our backing for those \r\nreforms. As an outward-looking, global Britain and \r\nthe second-biggest funder of the United Nations, the \r\nUnited Kingdom will remain committed to spending \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national income on development \r\nand humanitarian support. We will use our military to \r\nsupport peacekeeping, and our diplomats will continue \r\nto work to tackle conflict and to support peacebuilding. \r\nIn turn, the United Nations and its agencies must win \r\nour trust by proving to us and the people we represent \r\nthat they can deliver. That is why we will remain \r\ngenerous in our funding but will set aside 30 per cent \r\nto be paid only to those parts of the United Nations that \r\nachieve sufficient results.\r\nBut this is about more than technical reforms, \r\nimportant as they are. It is also about reforms that \r\nenable the United Nations to truly respond to the global \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. At last year’s \r\nGeneral Assembly we undertook to do far more to \r\nresolve the challenges of refugee and migration f lows. \r\nWe agreed to develop global compacts to address the \r\ncauses and the consequences of the mass movements \r\nof people we see today. That was an important step to \r\nelevate significantly our global response and enable us \r\ncollectively to tackle this challenge of our times.\r\nIn the year ahead, as well as agreeing the principles \r\nof those compacts, we must ensure they can be applied \r\nin practice. We must do more to identify, protect and \r\nsupport refugees and those hosting them near conflicts. \r\nOn migration, our starting point must be that it can \r\nbenefit both countries and migrants themselves, but \r\nonly when it is safe, orderly, well managed and legal. \r\nIf we do not manage that effectively, we will fail both \r\nour own citizens and those taking those dangerous \r\njourneys, and we will push more people into the curse \r\nof modern slavery at the hands of the human traffickers \r\nand organized criminal groups that drive that inhuman \r\nindustry.\r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n24/29 17-29395\r\nBut the steps we are agreeing through these \r\ncompacts alone will not be enough. For if people \r\ncannot find jobs, opportunity and hope for themselves \r\nand their families where they live, they will continue \r\nto look elsewhere. As the United Nations and as \r\nMembers, we must work harder to combine the efforts \r\nof our development programmes with the private sector \r\nand the international financial institutions to support \r\nthe creation of jobs and livelihoods that will address \r\nnot just the consequences but the causes of this great \r\nchallenge of our time. The truth is that, despite our best \r\nefforts, we are not succeeding. We must do more.\r\nThe same is true with terrorism, where again, the \r\nchallenges we face today are vastly different from \r\nthose of previous eras. When terrorists struck London \r\nand Manchester this year the world saw our cities \r\ncome together in defiance. Our Parliament carries \r\non. Ariana Grande came back to Manchester and \r\nsang again. London Bridge is bustling with people. \r\nOur communities came together at the Finsbury Park \r\nmosque in North London, and Londoners got back on \r\nthe Tube. The terrorists did not win, for we will never \r\nlet anyone destroy our way of life.\r\nBut defiance alone is not enough. As leaders, we \r\nhave all visited too many hospitals and seen too many \r\ninnocent people murdered in our countries. In the past \r\ndecade, hundreds of thousands have been killed by \r\nterrorists across the world. That is a truly global tragedy \r\nthat is increasingly touching the lives of us all. This year \r\nis the tenth anniversary of the death of the woman who \r\nintroduced me to my husband and who was known well \r\nto many of us in the United Nations. Benazir Bhutto \r\nwas brutally murdered by people who actively rejected \r\nthe values that all of us here in the United Nations stand \r\nfor, in a country that has suffered more than most at the \r\nhands of terrorists. She was murdered for standing up \r\nfor democracy, murdered for espousing tolerance and \r\nmurdered for being a woman.\r\nWhen I think of the hundreds of thousands of \r\nvictims of terrorism in countries across the world, I \r\nthink of their friends, their families, their communities, \r\ndevastated by that evil, and I say, enough is enough. \r\nOf course, we must continue to take the fight to these \r\nterrorist groups on the battlefield. The United Kingdom \r\nwill remain at the forefront of that effort, while also \r\nhelping to build the capabilities of our alliances and our \r\npartners to better take on this challenge.\r\nWe must also step up our efforts as never before to \r\ntackle the terrorist use of the Internet, for as the threat \r\nfrom terrorists evolves, so must our cooperation. That \r\nis why today, for the first time in the United Nations, \r\nGovernments and industry through the Global Internet \r\nForum to Counter Terrorism will be coming together \r\nto do just that. Tech companies have made significant \r\nprogress on that issue, but we need to go further and \r\nfaster to reduce the time it takes to remove terrorist \r\ncontent online and to increase significantly their efforts \r\nto stop it being uploaded in the first place. That is a \r\nmajor step in reclaiming the Internet from those who \r\nwould use it to do us harm.\r\nBut ultimately it is not just the terrorists themselves \r\nwho we need to defeat, it is the extremist ideologies that \r\nfuel them. It is the ideologies that preach hatred, sow \r\ndivision and undermine our common humanity. We \r\nmust be far more robust in identifying those ideologies \r\nand defeating them across all parts of our societies. \r\nAs I said in the aftermath of the attack on London \r\nBridge this summer, we have to face the fact that this \r\nwill require some difficult conversations. We all need \r\nto come together, to take on that extremism that lives \r\namong us and to nurture the common values that must \r\nultimately win out. They are the values of the United \r\nNations.\r\nAnd yet, despite our best efforts, we as nations \r\nand as a United Nations have not found the ways or \r\nthe means to truly take on that threat. That is why \r\ntoday, as I talk about United Nations reform, I ask the \r\nSecretary-General to make the fight against terrorists \r\nand the ideologies that drive them a core part of his \r\nagenda, at the heart of our development, peacebuilding \r\nand conflict-prevention work. To give that effort the \r\nprominence it surely requires, I am calling on the \r\nSecretary-General to make that a theme of next year’s \r\nGeneral Assembly and use it to harness the efforts of \r\nGovernments, the private sector and civil society so \r\nthat we can truly strike the generational blow against \r\nthat vile evil in our world.\r\nAs we do so, we must clearly strike the balance \r\nbetween protecting our people and protecting their \r\nfreedoms. We must always guard against those who \r\nwould use the fight against terrorism as a cover for \r\noppression and the violation of human rights. As we \r\nlook at the situation in northern Burma, I call on the \r\nBurmese authorities to put an end to the violence, \r\nallow humanitarian access and fully implement the \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 25/29\r\nrecommendations of the Advisory Commission on \r\nRakhine State.\r\nBy reforming our multinational institutions, we \r\ncan strengthen their ability to deliver for the people \r\nwe serve, protect the vulnerable and fight injustice. \r\nWe can enable multilateralism to multiply the effect \r\nof our individual commitments through its convening \r\npower and spending power, through the economies of \r\nscale it can bring, the standards it can set, the moral \r\nleadership it can harness and the legitimacy it can \r\nconfer. But multilateralism can only reflect the values \r\nthat individual States project and can only multiply \r\nthe commitments that they are prepared to make. It is \r\nstrong nations that form strong institutions and that \r\nprovide the basis of the international partnerships and \r\ncooperation that brings stability to our world.\r\nIt falls to us all to decide whether we will honour \r\nthe responsibilities that we have to one another. I have \r\ntalked about the role of the United Nations in stepping \r\nup on counter-terrorism. But that is an area that we \r\nas States have critical responsibilities that the United \r\nNations cannot itself address alone, for it is inescapable \r\nthat the terrorism, conflict and instability that we see \r\nacross the world are in many cases driven by the actions \r\nof States acting through proxies.\r\nWhen countries back groups like Hizbullah to \r\nincrease instability and conflict across the Middle \r\nEast, support so-called separatists in Ukraine to create \r\ninstability on Europe’s eastern borders, or give tacit \r\nsupport to criminal groups launching cyberattacks \r\nagainst our countries and institutions, they call into \r\nquestion the very rules and the international system \r\nthat protect us. That is why, both globally but also in \r\nour own continent of Europe, the United Kingdom will \r\nremain steadfast in our commitment and responsibility \r\nto ensure the security and stability of our friends and \r\nallies as we have done for generations.\r\nJust as it the responsibility of nations not to seek \r\nto advance their interests through terrorist or proxy \r\ngroups, so it is also the responsibility of each of \r\nus to act together in the face of the most egregious \r\nviolations of our common rules and standards. Clearly, \r\nresponsibility for the chaos and tragedy that we see in \r\nSyria lies firmly at the door of Al-Assad. He and his \r\nbackers have continually frustrated the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations to act as the broker of peace through \r\nthe Geneva process. As responsible States, we must not \r\nabandon our support for the United Nations attempts \r\nto secure peace and stability in Syria. Indeed, we must \r\ncontinue to call on all those with influence on the \r\nregime to bring them to the table.\r\nBut in recent weeks, the United Nations has also \r\nconfirmed what we all knew, namely, that the Syrian \r\nregime has used chemical weapons on its own people. \r\nIn the face of that fact, we have a responsibility to \r\nstand up, to hold the Syrian regime to account. That \r\nresponsibility sits with us all, but a particular, special \r\nresponsibility lies on the shoulders of the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council. As one of those \r\nfive members, the United Kingdom takes our special \r\nresponsibility seriously.\r\nI am proud that we have used the full weight of our \r\ndiplomacy to ensure that we have not had to exercise \r\nour veto in a generation. We seek to foster international \r\ncooperation, not frustrate it. But others have not done \r\nso. One country in particular has used its veto as many \r\ntimes in the past five years as in the whole of the second \r\nhalf of the Cold War. In doing so they have prevented \r\naction against a despicable regime that has murdered \r\nits own people with chemical weapons. As a result, \r\nin Syria, the United Nations has been blocked. That \r\nhas undermined the values that we hold dear and the \r\ninternational rules-based system that is the basis of \r\nsecurity and prosperity around the world.\r\nNow we face an even more immediate, global \r\ndanger in the activities of Kim Jong Un and his regime \r\nin the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Time \r\nafter time, he has shown contempt for the international \r\ncommunity of law-abiding States, contempt for his \r\nneighbours and contempt for the institutions and \r\nrules that have preserved peace and security. On that \r\nchallenge, the United Nations in recent weeks has \r\nshown it can step up to the task, with last Monday’s \r\nSecurity Council resolution creating the biggest \r\nsanctions package of the twenty-first century. We have \r\nseen regional and global Powers coming together and, \r\nas in the founding Charter, putting aside limited self-\r\ninterests to show leadership on behalf of the wider \r\nworld.\r\nBut despite those efforts, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea continues to defy and provoke the \r\ninternational community and threaten its neighbours. \r\nUnless all Security Council members continue to live \r\nup to the special responsibilities that are placed upon us \r\nand, in seeking to resolve that crisis, to be prepared to \r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n26/29 17-29395\r\ntake on necessary measures to tackle that threat, we will \r\nnot be able to bring stability to the Korean peninsula.\r\nAs the world looks on, I am calling for further steps \r\nand for nations with that special responsibility to work \r\ntogether and exert the pressure we know is necessary to \r\nforce Kim Jong Un to change his ways. Let us not fail \r\nthis time. Let our message to North Korea be clear: our \r\ndetermination to uphold those rules is stronger by far \r\nthan their determination to undermine them.\r\nThroughout the history of the United Nations, \r\ncountries have shown time and time again that by being \r\ntrue to our values, rules and standards, it is possible \r\nto come together and to deliver in ways that have the \r\nmost extraordinary impact on the lives of the people \r\nwe serve. I believe we can do so again. We must do so \r\nagain, and we will do so again.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the \r\nstatement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Paolo Gentiloni Silveri, President \r\nof the Council of Ministers of the Republic of \r\nItaly\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Council of Ministers of \r\nthe Republic of Italy.\r\nMr. Paolo Gentiloni Silveri, President of the \r\nCouncil of Ministers of the Republic of Italy, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Paolo Gentiloni Silveri, President \r\nof the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Italy, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Gentiloni Silveri (Italy) (spoke in Italian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I cannot begin \r\nmy statement without sparing a thought for a friendly \r\ncountry, Mexico, struck by a grave natural disaster. We \r\nexpress our solidarity with the families of the victims \r\nand our encouragement to the relief workers.\r\nThe seventy-second session of the General \r\nAssembly is taking place in a complex and constantly \r\nmoving global context. The socioeconomic effects of \r\nglobalization, which can create hardship and inequalities, \r\nalso compound the persistence of major instability in \r\nthe international geopolitical framework. The world \r\nseems more and more unpredictable, especially when it \r\nmust address extraordinary challenges.\r\nThe international community must find a way \r\nto overcome those obstacles and look to the future \r\nwith confidence. There is hope to be found in the \r\nsigns of optimism that accompany the recovery of \r\nour economies. It is up to us to navigate this road to \r\ndevelopment with responsibility and courage. We \r\nmust do so first through better governance of global \r\nprocesses to assure robust and inclusive economic \r\ngrowth aimed primarily at reducing inequalities. Italy \r\nis convinced that building democratic, pluralistic and \r\ninclusive societies that are open to diversity represents \r\nnot only an ethical imperative but also the best \r\nguarantee of peace and stability. This is a fundamental \r\npart of a broader commitment to promoting and \r\nguaranteeing effective protection of the human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms of each individual.\r\nThe shared journey of hopes and gains undertaken \r\nby the European Union — which for Italy represents the \r\nfirst natural dimension of multilateralism — teaches us \r\nthat we must have the courage to react to the challenges \r\nwe face daily. In the past two years the European Union \r\nhas been forced, perhaps for the first time, to abandon \r\nits “climate-controlled” environment — perhaps with \r\ndifficulty — in order to tackle some of the greatest \r\nchallenges to have emerged since the post-war period. \r\nIt has not been easy, nor has it been the beginning of the \r\nend, which many had feared, but rather an opportunity \r\nfor a powerful collective reminder of the need to remain \r\nunited within the European project.\r\nToday I affirm with profound conviction that a new \r\nEuropean impetus exists, which Italy not only shares \r\nbut actively promotes. There is a will to proceed as one \r\nto bring the European project closer to the needs of \r\ncitizens, the challenges of economic growth, security, \r\nand migration. It is a project that strengthens the greatly \r\nneeded global role of the Union in the world, inspired \r\nby multilateralism, free exchange and respect for rule \r\nof law.\r\nIn short, this story concerns us all, because a \r\nEuropean Union that can once again give the whole \r\nworld an example of solidarity, progress, prosperity \r\nand effectiveness is a contribution to the progress \r\nand development of the whole world. For Italy, \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 27/29\r\nthe development of social, economic and political \r\ninclusiveness, extended also to the labour market, \r\nas well as fighting poverty and marginalization, \r\nmeans contributing to a more effective management \r\nof the challenge of migration. We must respond with \r\ncompassion, intelligence and vision to the permanent \r\nreality of the vast human movements of our time.\r\nFor years, Italy has been engaged in operations \r\nto rescue and receive migrants. We have saved and \r\ncontinue to save hundreds of thousands of persons \r\nwho risked drowning in the Mediterranean, true to our \r\nethical and moral imperatives and to the international \r\nobligations we have freely undersigned. We are proud \r\nof this, but to consolidate our action we need a general, \r\nglobal response to the migration phenomenon. It cannot \r\nrely solely upon the generosity of some territories, in \r\nthe knowledge that there are nations in the world that \r\nare struck by migratory f lows on an even larger and \r\nmore serious scale than Italy.\r\nTo continue to affirm and embody the principle \r\nof shared and proportionate responsibility, Italy is \r\nparticipating actively in the negotiations that will \r\nlead to the adoption of global compacts in the United \r\nNations framework. Our proposal to jointly address the \r\nmigration phenomenon on a global level is based on \r\nthree main pillars: investing in support of the countries \r\nof origin and transit, protecting the most vulnerable \r\nrefugees and migrants, and valuing the many positive \r\naspects and opportunities created by migration.\r\nItaly is already the promoter of a true partnership \r\nwith the African countries. As I have already had \r\noccasion to express and repeat today with conviction, the \r\nfuture of Europe is in Africa. It is by investing in Africa \r\nthat we can address the deep causes of migration, first \r\nand foremost economic and demographic inequalities.\r\nWe are working with the International Organization \r\nfor Migration and the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees to provide assistance \r\nto migrants with respect for their human rights, \r\nassure the protection of refugees f leeing from wars \r\nand persecution and offer favourable conditions and \r\nincentives for their voluntary repatriation. Reducing \r\nthe power of human traffickers is the only way to create \r\nprogress for legal migration, which is also to the benefit \r\nof our countries and does not jeopardize the lives of \r\nmigrants. To protect those who are weakest is to protect \r\nour values. Saving the lives of children allows us to \r\nsave our societies, our honour and our future.\r\nFor Italy, by virtue of our geography and history, \r\nour emphasis on responsible and solidary management \r\nof the movement of persons is coupled with an emphasis \r\non the security, stability, sustainable development \r\nand growth of the Mediterranean and of the African \r\ncontinent as a whole. It is all included in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism and violent extremism. We know that \r\nthe ever-increasing apparent loss of territory for Da’esh \r\nin Iraq and Syria has demonstrated the effectiveness of \r\nour work but we also know that victory on the ground is \r\nnot enough. The fanaticism and ideology of Da’esh and \r\nof Jihad continue to claim victims and sow terror in our \r\ncities and in half of the cities around the world.\r\nItaly is an active partner in the Global Coalition \r\nagainst Da’esh and is engaged in various activities, \r\nstarting with the presence of its soldiers in Iraq \r\nand the second-largest contingent of the Coalition, \r\nafter the American contingent. Nonetheless, it is \r\nbecause we are engaged with our military forces that \r\nwe recall that the fight against terrorism requires a \r\nmultidimensional force. I would mention initiatives \r\nsuch as countering the use of the Internet and social \r\nmedia by terrorists — which we will address here at the \r\nUnited Nations — and the financing of terrorist groups. \r\nI would also point to the investments that we must make \r\nto promote culture and inclusiveness in our regions and \r\nin the neighbourhoods of our cities.\r\nWe have devoted great energy in the Security \r\nCouncil, the General Assembly and as the Chair of \r\nthe Group of Seven (G-7) to upgrade our capacity to \r\nrespond to the new threats posed by terrorist groups, \r\nwhich are ever-evolving. Libya is the key to restoring \r\nto the central Mediterranean its historic role as a driver \r\nof civilization, and to countering the risks and threats. \r\nAs we stated earlier today, its stabilization is a priority \r\nobjective that must reject every unrealistic hypothesis \r\nof a military solution or division of the country.\r\nItaly is a leader in that commitment, and we \r\nwelcome the fact that the United Nations has returned \r\nto action as a leader in Libya at the political level \r\nand at the level of providing assistance to refugees \r\nand migrants. We have an opportunity to restart the \r\npolitical process and prepare for upcoming elections. \r\nWe have that opportunity today. It is in our hands and \r\nin the hands of the United Nations.\r\nSyria continues to be a source of concern and \r\nsuffering. Let us not forget that. After six years of \r\nunspeakable violence, millions of refugees and hundreds \r\nA/72/PV.8 20/09/2017\r\n28/29 17-29395\r\nof thousands of deaths, we welcome the recent efforts \r\nto promote local truces in the de-escalation zones. Let \r\nus also remember that the only road to a lasting solution \r\nto the Syrian conflict is a realistic and credible political \r\nprocess.\r\nThere can be no stability, peace or reconstruction, \r\nor lasting victory over terrorism, or conditions for \r\nthe voluntary return of refugees in complete security \r\nwithout an inclusive political transition that brings \r\ntogether the various components of Syrian society. That \r\nis why I would like to reaffirm today at the General \r\nAssembly our full support for the role of the United \r\nNations and of Special Envoy De Mistura, and, at the \r\nsame time, urge the main regional and international \r\nstakeholders to support the road map outlined in \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2254 (2015). Finally, \r\nultimately, there could be no true peace without justice. \r\nThat means ascertaining who was responsible for \r\ncommitting atrocity crimes over the years, which began \r\nwith the use of chemical weapons.\r\nDialogue and reconciliation are also indispensable \r\ninstruments for lasting peace on the African continent. \r\nItaly has intensified and systematized just actions for \r\nthe Sahel region, in particular for the Niger, Chad and \r\nMali, which are working with immense difficulty to \r\nfight terrorist and criminal organizations and the illegal \r\ntrafficking activities linked to them, starting with the \r\nheinous trafficking in persons. In that context, we are \r\nconvinced that the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5) \r\ninitiative is essential and we welcomed the decision \r\nof the G-5 Sahel countries to launch, with the support \r\nof the African Union, a joint force. Italy continues to \r\nassure maximum support for the Horn of Africa — the \r\nkey to stability for the entire region and to resolving \r\na complex crisis aggravated by climate change, which \r\nhas led to a devastating drought.\r\nInitiatives in Somalia are moving in the right \r\ndirection. Italy will continue to support them, given our \r\nancient links to that country. \r\nI would be remiss if I did not mention our deep \r\nconcern about the very serious situation in Venezuela. \r\nIt is a situation that has turned a rich and prosperous \r\ncountry into a land of crises and suffering. Italy \r\nreiterates its call for an immediate and good-faith \r\ndialogue, which cannot disregard the four conditions \r\non the table, namely, authorization to send international \r\nassistance, a clearly established electoral calendar, the \r\nrestoration of the Parliament’s powers and the release of \r\nall political prisoners.\r\n Finally, we look upon the situation on the Korean \r\npeninsula with great anguish and distress, in the face \r\nof repeated violations of pertinent Security Council \r\nresolutions. It is fundamental for the international \r\ncommunity to remain unified and determined in its \r\nresponse and it is in that spirit that, as president of \r\nthe G-7, Italy promoted a firm group declaration. It is \r\ncrucial to ensure the full implementation of relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions. Every now and then, \r\nsomeone wonders about the usefulness of the United \r\nNations and about the many things happening in the \r\nworld, but the resolutions that we have unanimously \r\nadopted in recent weeks as instruments to exert pressure \r\non the dictator of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea are a positive result for the United Nations. They \r\ndemonstrate that we are ready to cooperate with our \r\npartners to continue to put the much needed diplomatic \r\nand economic pressure on the regime.\r\nWith regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, we believe \r\nthat the international community should ensure that the \r\nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action remains a positive \r\nfactor in the global efforts to counter the proliferation \r\nof weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, \r\nwe are convinced of the importance of the full and \r\ncomprehensive implementation of Security Council \r\nresolution 2231 (2015).\r\nAutocratic regimes, terrorism and international \r\nenvironmental crises pose a grave threat to the planet. \r\nBut we, the United Nations, cannot and will not \r\ngive up this fight. The Secretary-General has made \r\nprevention one of his highest priorities, and Italy \r\nsupports him in that commitment. We need to prevent \r\nconflict and natural disasters and the humanitarian \r\nand migration crises that follow, which, in turn, cause \r\nfurther instability. Prevention means everything except \r\nbuilding barriers. It means instead achieving inclusive \r\nand sustainable development and addressing crises \r\nwith multilateral efforts. We cannot face those threats \r\nalone. The response must be a joint response. The 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development outlines with \r\nclear-sighted ambition a shared path forward. Together, \r\nwe have written the prescription — now we must \r\nfollow through.\r\nClimate change calls for the same dedicated effort. \r\nSecretary-General Guterres pointed that out a few days \r\nago when he said that, if we do not address climate \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.8\r\n17-29395 29/29\r\nchange now, we will ruin many of our grandchildren’s \r\nopportunities for a positive and dignified life. We \r\nare facing an emergency, the social consequences of \r\nwhich do not need to projected onto the future. They \r\nare already tragically apparent. We need only think of \r\nthe more than 200 million displaced persons who, from \r\n2008 to 2015, were forced to leave their homes due to \r\nthe devastating effects of climate phenomena.\r\nThe crises and the challenges of our time can be \r\novercome, and those of the future can be prevented. \r\nIt depends on us, the United Nations. We need a \r\nUnited Nations that is more effective in enacting the \r\ninspirational principles that continue to be valid after \r\nso many years. We count, too, on the leadership of the \r\nSecretary-General. We fully support his reform plans, \r\nincluding his commitment to empowering women and \r\ngirls and the achievement of gender equality as a tool \r\nfor bolstering the efficiency of the Organization.\r\nThat revitalization also obviously includes the \r\nreform of the Security Council to render it more \r\ndemocratic, effective and representative of the entire \r\nmembership of the United Nations — because, just as \r\nthe membership has evolved and expanded since its \r\nestablishment, the same must occur in the primary \r\norgan that is its centre of responsibility.\r\nThe current global scenario calls upon us to \r\nrespond to many challenges that demonstrate that \r\nhistory did not end a quarter of a century ago, as some \r\nhad believed. We are called upon to constantly renew \r\nour endorsement of the values of peace, human rights, \r\ndemocracy and freedom. In other more difficult times \r\nof our history, we have seen those values retreat, but we \r\nknow that even in the most difficult times, democracy \r\ncan renew itself and grow and, in the end, can prevail.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.25 p.m.\r\n"
