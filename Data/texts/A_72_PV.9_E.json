"United Nations A/72/PV.9\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n9th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 20  September 2017, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Perera (Sri \r\nLanka), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Lenin Moreno Garcés, \r\nConstitutional President of the Republic of Ecuador\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Constitutional President of the \r\nRepublic of Ecuador.\r\nMr. Lenin Moreno Garcés, Constitutional President \r\nof the Republic of Ecuador, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Lenin Moreno Garcés, \r\nConstitutional President of the Republic of Ecuador, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Moreno Garcés (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAs I speak from this rostrum today, I can affirm that \r\nmuch progress has been made to achieve inclusion and \r\naccessibility; however, as a society we still have much \r\nthat remains to be done for the world’s 1 billion people \r\nliving with disabilities. I am an optimist. We are entirely \r\ncapable of finding solutions; it is a matter of political \r\nwill. That is why I am grateful for the accommodations \r\nthat have been made to enable me to address the General \r\nAssembly today.\r\nI congratulate the President, Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák, for proposing the topic for the general debate, \r\nnamely,”Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a \r\ndecent life for all on a sustainable planet”. Those are \r\ntruly today’s imperatives. Without a doubt, a responsible \r\nGovernment must take care of its citizens so that all \r\nof them may have a decent life on a sustainable planet \r\nwhere every day we work towards achieving peace.\r\nOur Government philosophy agrees that we must \r\ncare for our citizens throughout their lives, from the \r\nmoment of conception to when God decides to close \r\nour eyes. We must ensure a good life and a good death. \r\nThat is why we have organized the Government’s work \r\naround a plan that we have called “A Whole Life”. A \r\nresponsible country and Government must care for, \r\ninspire, encourage, support and be good to its citizens \r\nthroughout their entire lives under the principle of \r\nco-responsibility.\r\nTaking care of citizens begins with prenatal \r\nservices. After birth, we need to provide medical \r\ncare for the child, appropriate nutrition, vaccinations, \r\nneonatal screening and early intervention. Then comes \r\nthe stage when we must inspire the new human being \r\nand foster their love for science, knowledge, art and \r\nsports to shape their will and mind, thereby awakening \r\ntheir consciousness and planting the seeds of the values \r\nwithin them that will serve as the basis for their adult \r\nlife. In the next stage of life, it is crucial for us to propel \r\nour young people forward with an education — a high \r\nquality higher education — facilitating in that way the \r\nfulfilment of their endeavours, projects and dreams. \r\nBeyond that stage, we must provide support to \r\nindividuals with a view to ensuring the well-being of \r\ntheir families — the right to social security, housing, \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

At the end comes the stage of gratitude \r\nwhen we give back to the people who have served their \r\nsocieties and families — the care and services that we \r\nprovide to our senior citizens.\r\nWithin that vision of ensuring the rights of each \r\nindividual throughout their entire life, there persists an \r\nurgent need to eradicate all forms of violence. Today all \r\nof humankind has a moral and ethical duty — we must \r\nprohibit the abuse and killing of thousands of women \r\nand girls. There can be no more femicides, not even one. \r\nOur “A Whole Life” plan is, in sum, how we in Ecuador \r\nhave interpreted our commitment to the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. We unquestionably inherited the \r\nnotion from our indigenous peoples that the world must \r\nbe focused on the human being and their relationship to \r\nnature, in which the beginning and the end is to meet \r\nthe needs of all and make possible a life with dignity. \r\nMy indigenous brothers and sisters taught me that we \r\nwere born to be happy, and it is upon that premise that \r\nwe must govern, live, manage and act.\r\nHowever, we must also recognize that we are \r\nexperiencing a difficult and painful time as human \r\nbeings. We are facing many crises. We see a potential \r\nnuclear conflict, greater levels of inequality and \r\npoverty and a planet that must fight the devastating \r\neffects of climate change. If we continue along such \r\na path, there is no doubt that we are moving towards \r\ndestruction. Clearly that is evidence of the fact that \r\nwe, the human race, are failing. We must commit to \r\nachieving peace. Consistent with that need, today \r\nEcuador is acceding to the Treaty to Prohibit Nuclear \r\nWeapons. We call on all countries to accede to that \r\nhistoric international instrument.\r\nWe know that the military industry is a big business, \r\nwhich is why arms traffickers, and not arms producers, \r\nare prosecuted and convicted. What ethics are at play \r\nhere? How is it possible that resources that could be \r\ndevoted to financing the fulfilment of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals are wasted on the absurdity of war?\r\n We firmly believe that peace and development are \r\nachieved through dialogue; but if we continue with wars \r\nand blockades against countries and peoples, such as \r\nthe blockade against our brother country Cuba, we will \r\nnever be able to achieve true liberty and democracy. \r\nWe therefore insist that the sovereignty of States \r\nand non-intervention must be respected. We call for \r\ndialogue as a mechanism to resolve differences around \r\nthe globe, with full respect for international law.\r\nMilitary intervention is not the answer, as it only \r\nbrings with it suffering, pain and death. We therefore \r\nresolutely support the peace talks that the Government \r\nof Colombia is holding in our country with the National \r\nLiberation Army. We welcome the agreement reached \r\nin Quito, which was announced a few days ago, for a \r\nbilateral temporary ceasefire in Columbia. Step-by-\r\nstep we are nearing the goal of having the Community \r\nof Latin American and Caribbean States become a \r\nregion of peace.\r\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of my statement, \r\nwe have before us another major challenge — the \r\nalarming inequality in the world. It is unacceptable for \r\neight people in the world to possess the same wealth as \r\none half of humankind’s poorest. Such injustice goes \r\nagainst the rights to development and human dignity. \r\nA way to immediately confront inequality would be to \r\ninstitute fair tax measures. We must fight tax evasion \r\nand avoidance: those hidden resources are vital for the \r\ndevelopment of our countries.\r\nFurthermore, the use of tax shelters has served to \r\nhide corruption within both the public and the private \r\nsectors. If we truly want to fight corruption, we must \r\nencourage a culture of transparency. In our country, by \r\npopular agreement, the people of Ecuador decided that \r\nno public servant can have resources or goods in tax \r\nhavens. As Chair of the Group of 77 and China, Ecuador \r\nhas promoted a global agenda for fair tax actions. We \r\nreiterate the need to create an intergovernmental body \r\non tax cooperation at the United Nations. Another \r\nmechanism for promoting transparency would be a \r\nbinding instrument on transnational corporations and \r\nhuman rights. We appreciate the support of all countries \r\nthat share our views on such an initiative.\r\nLooking at the devastation caused by climatic \r\nphenomena in recent weeks, I would be remiss if I did \r\nnot express my solidarity with the peoples affected \r\nand turn to address one of the greatest challenges that \r\nhumankind faces, that is, the responsibility to combat \r\nclimate change. We must take care of our common home \r\nand ensure the survival of the planet. The unlimited \r\nexploitation of the environment has led us to live with \r\nthe consequences of climate change. We, the developing \r\ncountries, are those that pay the highest costs. Countries \r\nhave common but differentiated responsibilities. Those \r\nwho pollute the most must take greater responsibility.\r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.9\r\n17-29400 3/21\r\nAs the Assembly knows, Ecuador is one of the eight \r\nAmazonian countries. Having been born and raised in \r\nthe Ecuadorian Amazon, I have a duty to promote the \r\nprotection of the largest hydrographic basin in the world. \r\nIn the dialogue convened by the Secretary-General, I \r\npresented the Amazon initiative to stop deforestation \r\nand combat climate change. We advocate compliance \r\nwith all international agreements for the protection \r\nof nature, including the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of the oceans. We encourage bioknowledge and the \r\nbioeconomy. We must protect and make the most of \r\nthe knowledge of the guardians of nature, in particular \r\nindigenous peoples, communities and nations.\r\nI would like to refer to another issue of enormous \r\nimportance for today’s world, namely, the migration \r\ncrisis. Ecuador supports the principle of universal \r\ncitizenship and free mobility, because we are \r\nincreasingly interconnected, and the right to free \r\nmobility cannot be applied only to capital and goods. \r\nHuman mobility enriches peoples and contributes to \r\ncombating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia. \r\nWe strongly support the global compact for safe, orderly \r\nand regular migration, which is being discussed here in \r\nthe Assembly. Closing borders is not the solution. It has \r\nnever been the solution in the history of humankind.\r\nWhen I formed my Government, I called for major \r\nnational dialogue, without excluding anyone, in order \r\nto reach agreements that would allow us to build a more \r\nhumane, just and democratic society. Dialogue is the \r\nonly tool for building societies of peace. That means \r\nsocieties with jobs, high-quality education, access to \r\nhealth care as a right, decent housing and access to basic \r\nservices. Through dialogue, democracy is built, which \r\nis both a means of moving forward and our final goal.\r\nDemocracy is strengthened by generating and \r\npromoting spaces for young people to participate \r\nin politics. We have an obligation to generate new \r\nleadership so that they can take our place when the time \r\ncomes. We must maintain the defence of fundamental \r\nliberties, including those of expression and worship. \r\nWe must promote a new international order based on \r\npeace, respect for differences, equality and solidarity.\r\nWe do not want merely compassionate societies, \r\nbut rather societies that feature solidarity. That is \r\nwhy we need fundamental love for others, honesty \r\nand a sense of community. Faced with the failure of a \r\ndevelopment model based on accumulation, inequality \r\nand war, we can, and must, foster a new society based \r\non the construction of the common good. All countries \r\ncan achieve development with equity, if we have a fair \r\ninternational system and if we commit ourselves to the \r\neradication of poverty and inequality.\r\nOur challenges are great, but I am convinced \r\nthat we are capable of overcoming them. My deep \r\noptimism lies in the confidence that dialogue, political \r\ndecision-making and collective action will enable us to \r\nbuild a more humane and more just world in which we \r\ncan live with dignity.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Constitutional President \r\nof the Republic of Ecuador for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Lenín Moreno Garcés, Constitutional President \r\nof the Republic of Ecuador, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Ms. Gabriela Michetti Illia, \r\nVice-President of the Argentine Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by the Vice-President of the \r\nArgentine Republic.\r\nMs. Gabriela Michetti Illia, Vice-President of the \r\nArgentine Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Ms. Gabriela Michetti Illia, \r\nVice-President of the Argentine Republic, and inviting \r\nher to address the Assembly.\r\nMs. Michetti Illia (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI am very honoured and very happy to be here today \r\nrepresenting my country and my Government.\r\nAs an Argentine and a Latin American, I cannot \r\nbegin my statement without first expressing my \r\nsolidarity and the solidarity of Argentina with \r\nthose aff licted by the tragic earthquake in Mexico, \r\nwhich adds to the devastation caused by successive \r\nhurricanes in the Caribbean. The environment and the \r\nforces of nature are speaking to us and presenting us \r\nwith challenges.\r\nI would also like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák on his election and on his renewed commitment \r\nto the task of focusing our responsibilities as \r\nA/72/PV.9 20/09/2017\r\n4/21 17-29400\r\nGovernments on people. I believe that that is our most \r\nimportant mission. If the international community is \r\nstriving for peace, dialogue and understanding, and if \r\nwe working against poverty, violence and intolerance, \r\nArgentina will always be there to offer its support.\r\nThe leaders of the world have agreed on a plan \r\nof action in favour of people and the planet, namely, \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which \r\nstipulates that the eradication of poverty in all its forms \r\nis the greatest challenge facing the world in its efforts \r\nto achieve sustainable development. In keeping with \r\nthat global aspiration, our Government has established \r\nas one of the central axes of its programme the goal of \r\nmoving decisively towards zero poverty. As a sign of \r\nthat commitment at the international level, Argentina \r\npresented its first voluntary national review of its \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda in July.\r\nWe in Argentina are working to create a country \r\nwhere there is equal opportunity for all. That is why we \r\nare also focusing on the creation of jobs and inclusive \r\neducation. On that note, it is worth mentioning that we \r\nwill host the fourth Global Conference on the Sustained \r\nEradication of Child Labour in November, where we will \r\ntackle issues such as the eradication of forced labour \r\nand the promotion of high-quality youth employment. \r\nA debate on the future of work goes hand in hand with \r\nempowering our young people through high-quality \r\neducation. We dream of a world where a child’s destiny \r\nand a young person’s future have no limits other than \r\ntheir talent, intelligence, determination, will power and \r\ndesire to succeed in life.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights is \r\na State policy of Argentina that has been sustained \r\nsince we recovered our democracy in 1983. In that \r\nvein, we have been working closely with other actors \r\nin the regional and international systems for this to be \r\neffective. I take this opportunity to reiterate that our \r\ncountry has presented its candidacy for membership in \r\nthe Human Rights Council for the period 2019-2020. \r\nWe count on members’ support.\r\nOne of Argentina’s priorities is to ensure gender \r\nequality. We believe that it is important to educate our \r\ncommunities with the aim of eliminating the various \r\nforms of hidden violence within our society. For that \r\nreason, our Government has committed to implementing \r\nprogrammes that eliminate gender violence and achieve \r\nthe full empowerment of women and girls, including \r\ntheir political and economic autonomy, within the \r\nframework of our first national plan of action for the \r\nprevention, assistance and eradication of violence \r\nagainst women.\r\nOur Government has placed special emphasis on \r\nthe commitments made along with the international \r\ncommunity in the framework of the Convention on the \r\nRights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional \r\nProtocol, which was incorporated into our Constitution \r\nin 2014. In taking ownership of the spirit of Convention, \r\nwe have established an agency that focuses on \r\npolicymaking for disabled persons. The design and \r\nimplementation of a national plan is essential in terms \r\nof participation and working together with disabled \r\npersons. As that is an issue that I am personally \r\ninvolved in, I commit to working tirelessly to ensure \r\nthat the national plan covers all areas referred to in the \r\nConvention. From my own perspective as a person with \r\nan acquired disability, I wish to express here in the Hall \r\nthe deep commitment that both President Macri and I \r\nhave to changing the distorted view held by our culture \r\ntowards disability.\r\nI would also like to mention the global problem \r\nof drugs, which knows no limits or borders. We must \r\ncooperate and unite our efforts in order to confront \r\nit. The fight against drug trafficking is another of \r\nour President’s three main policies: we must redouble \r\nour international commitments to tackle that scourge. \r\nIn Argentina we are working in that vein to find a \r\nconsensus that will enable us to create an international \r\ncourt against organized crime in our region of \r\nLatin America.\r\nIt is with sadness that I refer to the situation that \r\nour sister Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is facing. \r\nOn 8 August, 12 States of Americas met in Lima to \r\ncondemn the rupture in the democratic order and the \r\nsystematic violation of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms as well as the violence, repression, political \r\npersecution, the existence of political prisoners and \r\nlack of free elections in that country. It pains me to \r\nspeak such words about a kindred country that is so \r\ndear to Argentina, and so, from this rostrum, I call \r\nfor credible negotiations in good faith, building on a \r\nconsensus of the parties that is oriented towards the \r\npeaceful re-establishment of democracy in Venezuela.\r\nThe Government of Argentina once again reiterates \r\nits condemnation of terrorism in all its forms. I wish to \r\nconvey the condolences of our people to the victims of \r\nthat scourge and their families. We know all too well \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.9\r\n17-29400 5/21\r\nwhat we speak of: my country has directly suffered \r\nfrom terrorism, having been the victim of two major \r\nattacks on the city of Buenos Aires, one in 1992 \r\nagainst the Embassy of Israel and then in 1994 against \r\nthe Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) \r\nheadquarters.\r\nI wish to reiterate the will of the Republic of \r\nArgentina to bring to justice all those who participated \r\nin the financing, planning, preparation and execution \r\nof those terrorist attacks. The continued investigation \r\nof the attack on AMIA calls for the appearance of the \r\naccused at a hearing. We do not want another 20 years \r\nto pass without justice being served. That is why we \r\ncall on the international community to support us in \r\nour requests for cooperation from the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran, which we have been submitting for some time \r\nin order to shed light on this terrorist attack.\r\nFor our Government, the new role of developing \r\ncountries requires the design of an international \r\narchitecture in finance and trade matters that is \r\noriented towards inclusive, sustainable and balanced \r\neconomic growth. In that context, Argentina reaffirms \r\nits determination to integrate with the world by building \r\nbridges with the international community. We have \r\ndemonstrated that by taking on the responsibilities of \r\nhosting the eleventh Ministerial Conference of the World \r\nTrade Organization (WTO) next December in Buenos \r\nAires and the presidency of the Group of 20 Summit \r\nin 2018, among others. We maintain our commitment \r\nto achieving positive outcomes at the Ministerial \r\nConference, which should reaffirm the importance of \r\nthe multilateral trade system, and of the WTO as its \r\nkeystone. It should also ensure that the benefits of free \r\ntrade reach all those who seek development, the creation \r\nof jobs, the eradication of poverty and the correction \r\nof trade distortions, particularly in relation to global \r\nagriculture and livestock markets.\r\nThe South American Common Market is our main \r\ntool for entering the international market. We know \r\nthat in the twenty-first century we cannot achieve \r\ndevelopment in our countries individually, just as we \r\ncannot do so in our personal lives. Nothing can be done \r\nalone, and we are always in need of others to enrich \r\nour projects and our lives. We must strengthen our \r\ncapacities and resources and establish the foundation \r\nwe need for growth. The current global situation \r\npresents challenges to us that confirm Argentina’s \r\ndecision to expand trade and improve our profile as a \r\ncountry for investment. That has led us to establish a \r\nSouthern Common Market in accordance with focused \r\nregionalism to attract investments and to strengthen \r\nparticipation in global value chains, which will have \r\nspecial emphasis and effect on small and medium-\r\nsized enterprises, generating more and better jobs. \r\nThat is why we have strongly encouraged negotiations \r\nwith the European Union, and those negotiations are \r\nentering their final phase. We are also negotiating with \r\nthe European Free Trade Association, and we will soon \r\nbe doing the same with Canada and with the Republic \r\nof Korea. We have also intensified our links with the \r\nPacific Alliance, with Japan and with New Zealand.\r\nArgentina’s international cooperation operates \r\nthrough the Argentine Fund for South-South and \r\nTriangular Cooperation, which is celebrating its twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary this year and is a fundamental foreign \r\npolicy mechanism that makes it possible for us to align \r\nourselves in solidarity and in a horizontal fashion \r\nwith other States. We need to update our strategies \r\nto create links and relationships with other mid-level \r\ndeveloped States. As a reflection of our vocation to \r\nenter the regional and international arenas, next March \r\nArgentina will be the host of the High-level United \r\nNations Conference on South-South Cooperation. We \r\nhope that that will provide an opportunity for debate \r\nand for the building of consensuses that will make it \r\npossible for us to achieve a fairer, more equal world.\r\nArgentina reaffirms its commitment to United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations. We will continue \r\nto provide our assistance, especially in Haiti and in \r\nColombia.\r\nArgentina promotes its presence on the \r\ninternational stage with the aim of achieving better \r\nlevels of protection and a sustainable and rational use \r\nof our natural resources, and we encourage all projects \r\nand all activities that improve the living conditions of \r\nthe people living on our national territory. Care for the \r\nenvironment is a priority for my Government. Growth \r\ncannot take place in a manner that is out of balance \r\nwith the environment. As Pope Francis warned, the \r\npace of consumption, of waste and of change in the \r\nenvironment has gone beyond the resources of the \r\nplanet. The environment is a collective good; it is the \r\nheritage of all of humankind, and it is everybody’s \r\nresponsibility. Protecting the environment should be a \r\ncomprehensive part of the development process. It must \r\nnot be seen in isolation. Argentina is committed to the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change. It upholds that \r\ncommitment and will continue upholding it with other \r\nA/72/PV.9 20/09/2017\r\n6/21 17-29400\r\nStates parties in the preparatory process for the twenty-\r\nthird Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in order \r\nto achieve concrete progress in the implementation of \r\nthe Convention.\r\nWe wish to reiterate our legitimate and inalienable \r\nright of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, South \r\nGeorgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and the \r\nsurrounding maritime areas. Once again, we call upon \r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland to renew bilateral negotiations, which will make \r\nit possible for us to find a peaceful permanent solution \r\nthat respects the way of life of the islanders and that \r\nis in accordance with the resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly and the Special Committee on the Situation \r\nwith regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on \r\nthe Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and \r\nPeoples. Our Government has begun a new phase in our \r\nrelations with the United Kingdom. We hope that that \r\nwill contribute to the creation of conditions in which \r\nboth Governments can sit at the negotiating table with \r\na view to resolving this protracted sovereignty dispute.\r\nTwo years ago our Governments met in this Hall \r\nto add their voices to a collective commitment, which \r\ntook the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Taking on in a determined manner the \r\ntargets and goals set by the 2030 Agenda will allow \r\nus to build a better world for coming generations. The \r\nprogress that we have already made bears witness \r\nto the fact that focusing on people, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral requests that we do, is the only way to respond \r\nto our task.\r\nThe phase of history that we are living through is \r\nfull of challenges and opportunities. I welcome the fact \r\nthat in every corner of our planet there is a renewed \r\nperspective with regard to the vital, distinct contribution \r\nthat women can and must make, provided that we bring \r\nfeminine attributes into play. What am I talking about? \r\nI am talking about our natural tendency as women to \r\nunite in a world where disintegrating forces seem to be \r\ngaining strength and prevailing. We have a vocation for \r\nlong-term vision when everything around us appears \r\nto be uncertain. We have the vocation of nourishing, \r\nof caring for others, of seeing with empathy, and of \r\nputting ourselves in other people’s shoes. All of those \r\nare indispensable feminine qualities that we must put \r\ninto play if we want a more equal and more just society.\r\nThose attributes are indeed vital but, as we know, \r\nthey are not the exclusive domain of women. Neither \r\nare we are the only people needed to reach the goals that \r\nwe have set. It would be extremely counterproductive \r\nto sacrifice the contribution of any gender, tradition, \r\nreligion or culture on the altar of our prejudices. We \r\nneed everybody. We must all bear the enormous burden \r\nof ensuring that this stage of history will bear fruit in \r\nthe lifetime of each individual. In that way, without \r\nexcluding anybody who wants to contribute towards \r\nthat work, we will achieve a global society that is more \r\nprosperous and, above all, more just and fair. Our work \r\nmust be a work of love because justice and the quest \r\nfor the common good are the expression of love in the \r\npublic sphere.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nArgentine Republic for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Marta Gabriela Michetti Illia, Vice-President \r\nof the Argentine Republic, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of \r\nthe Republic of the Congo\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Denis Sassou \r\nNguesso, President of the Republic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Congo, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Congo, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Sassou Nguesso (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express my sincerest condolences \r\nto the people and the Government of Mexico in the \r\nwake of the earthquake that was so devastating for that \r\ncountry.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf, \r\nI would like to extend to the President our heartfelt \r\ncongratulations on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session. I also \r\nexpress our gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Peter \r\nThomson, to whom we pay warm tribute for the work \r\naccomplished. We also once again wish Secretary-\r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.9\r\n17-29400 7/21\r\nGeneral Guterres every success in the fulfilment of \r\nhis mandate.\r\nI note with interest the great significance of the \r\ntheme of this general debate. Indeed, focusing on \r\npeople and striving for peace and a decent life for all \r\non a sustainable planet is a tremendous challenge that \r\ncalls for a spirit of openness and responsibility on all \r\nour parts.\r\nHumankind faces many challenges. Terrorism \r\nis spreading its reach daily. No continent is immune \r\nto violence perpetrated in the name of extremism \r\nand nationalism. The increased tensions on the \r\nKorean peninsula could lead to nuclear conflict on an \r\nunprecedented scale. The situations in Syria and Iraq, \r\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the nuclear threat and \r\nthe crises in Africa and other parts of the world mean \r\nthat there is now a pressing moral need for peace, \r\nwithout which nothing constructive or sustainable can \r\nbe built. That has always been our guiding light.\r\nWhenever circumstances allow, the Congo has \r\nalways seized every opportunity to uphold the ideals \r\nof peace and justice in Africa and across the world. It \r\nis in that context that, on 19 October, my country will \r\nhost the next Summit of the International Conference \r\non the Great Lakes Region and the seventh High-\r\nLevel Meeting of the Follow-up Mechanism of the \r\nPeace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the Region. The \r\nSummit will provide an opportunity to consider ways \r\nand means of resolving the various crises that currently \r\naff lict that part of our continent.\r\nIn addition, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand other countries in the Great Lakes region are \r\nconfronted with various crises. I refer in particular to \r\nthe Central African Republic, Burundi and South Sudan. \r\nIn the case of the Central African Republic, the return \r\nto peace is moving forward apace. The Government \r\nand the people of the Congo are unwavering in their \r\nsupport for the people of the Central African Republic. \r\nThe implementation of the Road Map for Peace and \r\nReconciliation in the Central African Republic, \r\nadopted in July under the auspices the African Union, \r\nshould provide new impetus to the stabilization of that \r\nfraternal country.\r\nMoreover, the search for solutions for an effective \r\nexit from the crisis in Libya as part of the mandate \r\nentrusted by the African Union to the Congo is \r\nunquestionably moving in the right direction. The \r\nholding of the fourth meeting of the African Union \r\nHigh-level Committee on Libya on 1 September in \r\nBrazzaville led to quite heartening progress. All \r\nmajor stakeholders in the Libyan crisis and members \r\nof the dialogue committees set up by the Libyans \r\nthemselves travelled to Brazzaville during or just after \r\nthe Summit. A final communiqué and road map were \r\nadopted at the end of the meeting. The commission \r\nfor inter-Libyan dialogue has begun its discussions, \r\nand they will essentially focus on the amendment of \r\nthe Libyan Political Agreement adopted in Skhirat on \r\n17 December 2015 and the inter-Libyan conference that \r\nis to take place in Addis Ababa in December. From this \r\nrostrum, I would like to reiterate my country’s resolve \r\nto continue working for peace in Libya. That is why I \r\nurge the international community to support the efforts \r\nof the Congo to strengthen initiatives conducive to a \r\npositive outcome for those various crises.\r\nUndoubtedly, poverty will continue to pose a \r\nlasting global challenge until we break the cycle of \r\ndependence and dramatic contingencies that has been \r\ncaused by disturbing changes of natural ecosystems. \r\nIn that respect, the globalizing and interdependent \r\nnature of our response is undeniable. Beyond our \r\ndifferences, we must draw on the regulatory capacities \r\nof the great Powers, in conjunction with the search for \r\nadapted paradigms and more effective solidarity aimed \r\nat advancing the developing economies. Our global \r\nstability depends upon that.\r\nIn that particular context, Africa has been affected \r\nby the tragedy of emigration across the Mediterranean \r\nSea. Similarly, the forced displacement of populations \r\ntowards more hospitable areas, as a result of climate \r\nchange, gives a measure of the distress of men, women \r\nand children — all victims. It is a matter of concern \r\nto us all. We must take significant action in a spirit of \r\nsolidarity and mutual understanding so as to contain \r\nthose exoduses towards uncertainty and save the lives \r\nof thousands of Africans.\r\nAs a truly global issue, the climate was the subject \r\nof promising discussions regarding its future at the Paris \r\nConference in 2015. It is urgent that the commitments \r\nmade there be kept. For the collective consciousness of \r\nhumankind, that is the place to express our compassion \r\nand solidarity with the populations that are victim to \r\nthe harmful consequences of climate change. I refer \r\nspecifically to the devastating effects of Hurricane \r\nIrma in North America and the f loods and landslides in \r\nAsia and some African countries, particularly in Sierra \r\nA/72/PV.9 20/09/2017\r\n8/21 17-29400\r\nLeone. Once again, we must agree that the protection of \r\nthe environment is a common and imperative obligation.\r\nIn that context, my country initiated the Blue Fund \r\nfor the Congo Basin on the sidelines of the twenty-\r\nsecond session of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. The memorandum of understanding that was \r\nsigned last March in Oyo, the Congo, marks the first \r\nstep in the Fund’s creation. That financial instrument \r\naims to ensure a better quality of life for our people \r\nand protect the forests of the Congo basin, which \r\nis the second-largest green lung in the world after \r\nthe Amazon. I invite the international community to \r\nsupport the Congo in that initiative aimed at protecting \r\nour planet from global warming.\r\nA decent life for all also means allowing our \r\npopulations to benefit from high-quality health care. \r\nThe proliferation of counterfeit and sub-standard \r\nmedicines is an increasingly serious threat to the world, \r\nparticularly for developing countries. The expansion of \r\nthat scourge brings to mind various carefully organized \r\nforms of trafficking that have helped to finance \r\nterrorism. According to the World Health Organization, \r\ncounterfeit medicines lead to 800,000 deaths a year. \r\nApproximately 10 per cent of medicines in circulation \r\nworldwide are estimated to be counterfeit. In Africa and \r\nthe countries of the South in general, that figure may \r\nreach 40 per cent, and even 60 per cent in some regions.\r\nIn addition to the efforts of the World Health \r\nOrganization, vigorous action at the level of the General \r\nAssembly should be undertaken with a view to defining \r\na comprehensive strategy to combat the peril. Advocacy \r\nin that area requires the constant mobilization of all \r\ncountries, including sustained attention and substantial \r\nfinancial allocations. For our part, my country has \r\nengaged in the fight in collaboration with the Brazzaville \r\nFoundation for Peace and Conservation.\r\nThe Republic of the Congo is experiencing a \r\nperiod that is marked by socioeconomic concern for the \r\ndrastic decrease in oil prices. Budgetary adjustments \r\nare now envisaged, with the support of international \r\nfinancial institutions. In spite of the dismal situation, \r\nthe Congo continues its resolute march towards the \r\nconsolidation of its democracy. More than ever, the \r\nvirtues of constructive dialogue are being brought into \r\nplay. An institutional framework was implemented \r\nafter the presidential, legislative, local and senatorial \r\nelections. The stakeholders of the nation are exercising \r\ntheir rights in complete freedom.\r\nTransforming the world into a haven of peace and \r\nprosperity is possible. We are given proof of that with \r\nevery passing day. It is up to us to realize that goal, \r\nwhile leaving no one behind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof the Congo for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Congo, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Ms. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President \r\nof the Republic of Chile\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Chile.\r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Ms. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Chile, and to invite her to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bachelet Jeria (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwant to begin by sending a fraternal greeting to the \r\npeople of Mexico, and especially to the relatives and \r\nfriends of the victims of the terrible earthquake that \r\nstruck that fraternal country yesterday. I also convey \r\nmy sentiments to the victims and all those affected \r\nby the hurricanes that in recent weeks and days have \r\ncaused enormous damage in the region and, in some \r\ncases, irreparable losses.\r\nThose most recent catastrophes, caused by hurricanes \r\nmore frequent and violent than usual — largely due to \r\nthe warming of the oceans — remind us that we are at \r\na key moment in the history of humankind, a defining \r\nmoment that will have repercussions on our lives and on \r\nthe lives of our grandchildren and great-grandchildren. \r\nWhile the challenges we face today are different from \r\nthose that gave rise to the Organization 72 years ago, \r\nthey are as relevant and as defining as those faced by \r\nthe postwar generation. \r\nOn the one hand, the notion of development \r\nthat has prevailed until now has been shaken by the \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.9\r\n17-29400 9/21\r\nrelentless reality of climate change. We can close our \r\neyes and deny a reality whose devastating effects \r\nwill become more frequent and intense, or we can \r\nassume our responsibility. Beyond reducing carbon \r\ndioxide emissions, that implies daring to transform our \r\nproduction models and rethinking the type of growth \r\nwe wish to promote.\r\nOn the other hand, at a time when there is \r\ndemocracy in so many countries as never before, we see \r\na citizenry that has grown impatient with institutions \r\nwhose legitimacy has been called into question by \r\ncorruption, inequality and inefficiency with regard to \r\ncitizens’ most urgent demands.\r\nFinally, in an international scenario marked by \r\nuncertainty, another definition is required. We either \r\nlet each State attempt to impose itself and take the \r\ngreatest advantage of its position, or we work actively \r\nfor common peace and stability by strengthening the \r\nmultilateral instruments and cooperation. The fact \r\nthat we are here today in this Hall, where so many \r\nhave touted the strength of peaceful and collective \r\nwork, requires us to look at the risks we face and \r\ntake on individual and collective tasks, weighing the \r\nconsequences of inaction.\r\nToday I bring the voice of Chile — a country that \r\nhas learned from its history, a country that has known \r\npain, but also hope. Beyond its geographical location \r\nin the extreme south of the American continent, \r\nmy country is in fact not far from the world. Quite \r\nthe contrary, it is fully within it. We therefore know \r\nthat many of the great local challenges are, and will \r\ncontinue to be, global challenges, and that each global \r\nchallenge must also find a local response. There is no \r\nroom for fatalism in the face of those challenges. Today \r\nI bring the message of realistic optimism. It is possible \r\nto reverse past decisions, overcome inertia and correct \r\nour path. That is true for small and large countries, be \r\nthey in the centre or on the periphery. \r\nThe enormous strength of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) is precisely that they \r\nnot only propose a new approach to improving the \r\nliving conditions of people, they propose that we do it \r\ntogether, based on the strengths of each country. Our \r\ncommitment to national tasks is bolstered by contact \r\nwith others. Faced with the choice of whether or not \r\nto join the fight against climate change, we have \r\nnot doubted — simply because there is no room for \r\ndenialism or selfish postures.\r\nIn line with SDG 14, on the oceans, and the Paris \r\nAgreement, my country has launched a national \r\naction plan for climate change. Among the measures \r\nalready under way are the green tax on carbon dioxide \r\nemissions from fixed sources and the transformation \r\nwe have made in the energy sector. Since the start \r\nof this Administration, non-conventional renewable \r\nenergy has gone from 6.3 per cent to 17 per cent of our \r\nmatrix, and our goal is to reach 90 per cent by 2050. \r\nThat is possible, because we have already started the \r\nenergy transition.\r\nIn addition, we have been active in the Our Oceans \r\ninitiative. We have created new marine parks and \r\nmarine-protected areas. Almost half of our exclusive \r\neconomic zone is protected today, reaching the \r\nhistoric figure of 1,329,000 square kilometres under \r\nmarine conservation.\r\nWhile we have made significant progress in that \r\ndirection, we are aware that we must address another \r\nthreat to marine ecosystems — plastics. Year after year, \r\n8 million tons of plastic make their way to the ocean, \r\nremaining there for hundreds of years and making \r\na huge negative impact. To tackle that problem, we \r\nparticipate in the Clean Seas campaign of the United \r\nNations Environment Programme. Meanwhile, at the \r\nlocal level, we will present a draft bill to ban the use of \r\nplastic bags in coastal cities within 12 months. That law \r\nwill permit citizens to contribute to the protection of \r\nthe oceans. We will thus be the first country in America \r\nto implement that type of law, and we call on other \r\ncountries to assume that responsibility.\r\nAdditionally, it is now 30 years since the adoption \r\nof the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the \r\nOzone Layer, which enabled the ozone layer to recover. \r\nOn this thirtieth anniversary, I would like to announce \r\nthat my country has just deposited its ratification of \r\nthe 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, \r\nwhich aims to prevent 0.5°C of global warming. Chile \r\nthereby becomes one of the first countries to ratify that \r\nnew agreement. But that is not all. With the creation of \r\na network of parks in Patagonia, we have also added \r\n4.5 million hectares of green areas, rich in biodiversity, \r\nwhich will now be protected by the State for public use.\r\nThat shows that it is possible to move forward \r\nwhen there is will, when the public and private worlds \r\njoin forces. Sustainable development is not a desire \r\nA/72/PV.9 20/09/2017\r\n10/21 17-29400\r\nimpossible to finance. On the contrary, it is the best \r\nway for economic activity to be sustained over time.\r\nBut as I said at the beginning of my remarks, this is \r\nnot the only dilemma. We also share pressing challenges \r\nin terms of democracy and inclusion. International \r\nexperience has helped us and alerted us to the need to \r\ntake charge of improving our democratic institutions, \r\nas well as transparency and probity in both politics and \r\nbusiness, putting a brake on corruption.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nIn that connection, we substantially modified \r\nthe electoral system that we inherited from the \r\ndictatorship, making it more proportional and inclusive \r\nand guaranteeing a minimum quota of 40 per cent for \r\nfemale candidates. Along with that, we made changes \r\nto the regulations that govern the financing of electoral \r\ncampaigns and political parties so that money does \r\nnot define the outcome of elections. And we are in the \r\nprocess of a participatory drafting of a new constitution \r\nthat is more modern and democratic.\r\nBut we understand that strengthening our \r\ndemocracy is not enough if we do not respond to the \r\ndemand for greater individual liberties and rights for \r\npeople. That is why we have made decisive progress \r\nin expanding sexual and reproductive freedoms and \r\nrights. Of course, that movement towards higher levels \r\nof individual freedom must be accompanied by social \r\npolicies that promote equality and solidarity and expand \r\npeople’s capacities. That is why education is at the heart \r\nof our reforms.\r\nIn less than four years, we have implemented \r\nimportant changes to ensure, on the one hand, that \r\npeople will have the education they need and deserve, \r\nregardless of their socioeconomic situation, and, \r\non the other, that Chile can count on professionals \r\nand technicians in the most important areas for its \r\ndevelopment. We have done that by enacting reforms \r\nfrom nursery school to higher education, and we have \r\nput public education at the centre of that movement. We \r\nare gradually increasing access to free education, first \r\nfor lower-income families — next year, 60 per cent of \r\nour students will be have access to higher education \r\nfree of charge — and then for the entire population.\r\nThat is our way of promoting the idea that there \r\ncan be no individual progress without collective \r\nprogress, that there can be no lasting well-being where \r\na few privileged groups become disconnected from \r\nthe most disadvantaged. That is our way of realizing \r\nthat well-being must be founded on a common link and \r\nuniversal values in order to become a reality.\r\nLastly, with regard to the third definition we are \r\ncalled upon to understand, I unreservedly state that \r\nChile maintains an unchanging strategic understanding \r\nof peace, democracy, human rights and the rights \r\nof migrants, and free trade. For that reason, I cannot \r\nhelp but mention the situation of our brother country \r\nVenezuela. Chile, together with 11 countries in the \r\nregion, has called for credible dialogue between the \r\nGovernment and the opposition. We are prepared to \r\nplay the role that Venezuelans deem appropriate in \r\norder to achieve good results in a peaceful, political and \r\ndemocratic manner.\r\nIn the same vein, we are not the only ones to express \r\nour concern about the threats to peace in different parts \r\nof the world, such as the Middle East and areas of \r\nAfrica and Eastern Europe, in particular with regard \r\nto the insistence on the use of nuclear weapons, which \r\ntests the very limits of peaceful coexistence.  As we \r\nhave publicly indicated, we hope that the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea will stop the nuclear tests, \r\ncomply with the resolutions of the Security Council, \r\ncontribute to guaranteeing lasting stability in North-\r\nEast Asia and agree to resolve the situation through \r\npeaceful diplomatic and political channels.\r\nIn that context, we actively participated in \r\nnegotiations for the Treaty on the Prohibition of \r\nNuclear Weapons, which we signed this morning. That \r\nhistoric act creates a standard that sets the basis for \r\nfuture negotiations, making it possible to completely \r\neliminate nuclear weapons in a verifiable, irreversible \r\nmanner.\r\nAlong with that, I wish to express our pride and \r\nsatisfaction at having participated for 13 years, with \r\nmore than 12,000 men and women, in the troop and \r\npolice contingents of the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti. We have renewed our commitment \r\nto continuing to participate in cooperation with our \r\nspecialized police in the United Nations Mission for \r\nJustice Support in Haiti. Furthermore, as part of our \r\npolicy on cooperation for development, Haiti has been \r\nmade a priority partner, like the Caribbean and Central \r\nAmerica, in programmes to improve institutions, \r\nsecurity, enterprise and professional training.\r\nAlong the same lines, I also wish to highlight the \r\nparticipation of Chilean observers in the peace process \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.9\r\n17-29400 11/21\r\nin Colombia, who are wrapping up the first special \r\npolitical mission and initiating the transition to the \r\nsecond. Chile also participated in the first stage of \r\nthe process with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \r\nColombia, and we are now participating as a garantor \r\nin conversations between the Colombian Government \r\nand the National Liberation Army.\r\nWe do not believe only in the peaceful resolution \r\nof conflicts and disputes, but also in the enormous \r\nopportunities opened up by trade. We have worked \r\nintensely with our bilateral partners and with the \r\nPacific Alliance to create what we call convergence \r\nin diversity. Latin American countries should come \r\ntogether on the basis of that which unites us instead of \r\ndwelling on our differences. That is to say, on each and \r\nevery issue that pertains to international coexistence, \r\nwe have affirmed, and will continue to reaffirm, our \r\ncommitment to multilateralism and the existence of \r\nrules that guarantee the fair treatment of each country.\r\nLike other middle-income countries, my country \r\nfaces major short- and medium-term challenges. \r\nThat is why we value the multidimensional vision for \r\ndevelopment set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, which recognize the differences between \r\ncountries and gaps in development that are obscured \r\nwhen the only measurement of development is per \r\ncapita income.\r\nYet it appears that we are facing a contradiction. \r\nMiddle-income countries, including many small \r\nisland developing States in the Caribbean, are being \r\ngraduated by the Development Assistance Committee \r\nof the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment solely for having passed the per-capita \r\nincome criterion. Where, then, is the multidimensional \r\ncriterion of the 2030 Agenda?\r\nFaced with that situation, Chile, together with \r\nother countries in the region, has spoken out and \r\nrequested that a serious dialogue be initiated regarding \r\nthe incorporation of multidimensional criteria in the \r\ndefinition of development. Together with Jamaica, we \r\nare launching a new initiative, the Resilient 20, which \r\nseeks to create an alliance to promote resilience in \r\ncountries that are vulnerable to natural disasters, with \r\na focus on middle-income countries but not limited \r\nto them.\r\nFaced with the challenges presented by governance \r\nof the international community, I reaffirm the value of \r\nthis Assembly and this Organization. That is why we \r\nsupport the transformations promoted by Secretary-\r\nGeneral António Guterres for managing the Secretariat, \r\nwhich will facilitate decision-making in key sectors \r\nin both policy and administrative issues as well as \r\npromote confidence between Member States and the \r\nOrganization. We have also supported the readjustments \r\nto the process of selecting and appointing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral so as to make it more transparent and inclusive \r\nof all Member States. The long-awaited reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, to make it more democratically \r\nrepresentative and fitting for the realities of the world \r\ntoday, is still pending.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nThe world is seen differently from the South. \r\nWhile we still see vast sectors of our countries without \r\naccess to the most basic public services, and when \r\nthere is still hunger, segregation, precarious work and \r\nenormous inequality, there is only one conclusion: we \r\nhave a long way to go for the agenda of solidarity to \r\novercome the agenda of selfishness and indifference. It \r\nis true that some of those challenges are not exclusive \r\nto emerging countries — advanced democracies are \r\nalso experiencing them. But the demands continue to \r\nbe far more basic in the South. Chile has made major \r\nprogress. In several areas we have reached standards \r\nthat near those of developed countries, and we are \r\nproud of those gains.\r\nHowever, there are still many countries in Latin \r\nAmerica, Africa and Asia that are facing histories of \r\npain and frustration. We share with them a history of \r\neffort and hope that bonds us together in the present and \r\nthe future. Because we have known scarcity, we know \r\nwhat it is to fight to break free of underdevelopment, \r\nas well as the fear of falling back into its grasp. We \r\nalso know what it is to be a middle-income country \r\nwith a healthy, solid economy yet with dramatic gaps in \r\nequality and opportunity for its inhabitants.\r\nWe therefore know at first hand the need to make \r\nchanges, but also that change must come about through \r\nsolidarity, which we claim not only for individuals but \r\nalso for peoples. To share, cooperate and collaborate is \r\nthe first step in societies caring for themselves, to regard \r\nthe present and the future with greater certainty. Today \r\nit is true that the needs of the global scene are different, \r\nbut they are urgent and require historic efforts from \r\none and from all. We must cooperate on the level of \r\neach country on projects coordinated between nations \r\nA/72/PV.9 20/09/2017\r\n12/21 17-29400\r\nand guided by a clear agenda that inspires us all and to \r\nwhich we can all contribute.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Chile \r\nfor the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Raimonds Vējonis, President of the \r\nRepublic of Latvia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Latvia.\r\nMr. Raimonds Vējonis, President of the Republic \r\nof Latvia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Raimonds Vējonis, President of the \r\nRepublic of Latvia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Vējonis: First of all, I would like to \r\nexpress my solidarity to the Mexican people, who are \r\ndealing with the aftermath of a devastating earthquake.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to congratulate you, \r\nMr. Lajčák, on assuming the post of President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its current session. I am sure you \r\nwill make our region proud.\r\nThe United Nations is, and will be, the central \r\nforum for multilateralism and a rules-based global \r\norder. This is the place where all nations come together \r\nto carry out our shared responsibility to deliver peace \r\nand security, advance human rights and sustainable \r\ndevelopment and cooperate for a better future. As the \r\ntruly global Organization, the United Nations must be \r\nable to effectively respond to the serious global issues \r\nthat we face: regional conflicts and humanitarian crises, \r\nthe threat of terrorism, insecurity related to migration, \r\nclimate change and poverty. Individuals and their need \r\nfor peace and a decent life are at the centre of all those \r\nchallenges. We must be able to deliver on those needs \r\nas individual nations and as the United Nations.\r\nIt is no secret that the Organization has grown too \r\ncomplex and bureaucratic to be able to respond swiftly \r\nto today’s challenges. Some even question its credibility \r\nand relevance. Latvia also wishes to see the United \r\nNations become more effective, more transparent and \r\nmore f lexible so that it can can make a positive, real \r\ninfluence for people on the ground. While the most \r\nrecent global agreements have shown that effective \r\nmultilateralism is possible, we must bring the values \r\nand goals of the United Nations closer to the people. The \r\nUnited Nations must preserve and, in some instances, \r\nregain, the trust of citizens and Member States in its \r\nability to prevent and respond to crises and to promote \r\na rules-based global order.\r\nThe new Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, \r\nwas appointed on a platform of change. Latvia \r\nwelcomes his appointment and fully supports his vision \r\nof a more effective United Nations. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s actions and ideas related to qualitative \r\nchange and reforms in the United Nations are very \r\nencouraging signs. Reform is never an easy task, but \r\nwith patience, clear goals and the cooperation of the \r\nUnited Nations system and Member States, reform is \r\npossible. The Secretary-General has our full support \r\nfor his endeavours.\r\nAll people on the planet need peace. For people \r\nto fully realize their potential, a stable and secure \r\nenvironment is essential. In too many places, conflicts \r\nseem to have no end. The very basic principles of \r\ninternational law are violated, borders are changed \r\nby force and human lives suffer. Far too often, the \r\nUnited Nations has been unable to prevent conflicts, \r\nstop atrocities or build peace. Too often, resources are \r\nspent managing and responding to crises instead of \r\npreventing them.\r\nThe Security Council bears a particular \r\nresponsibility for ensuring peace. Its members, \r\nespecially the veto-wielding members, should move \r\nbeyond their domestic interests in the name of genuinely \r\naddressing global challenges. People see the failures of \r\nthe Security Council as failures of the Organization. \r\nWe cannot expect trust in the United Nations if the \r\nSecurity Council does not deliver. Latvia also reiterates \r\nits call for reform of the Security Council, which is \r\nlong overdue.\r\nFrom his first day on the job, the Secretary-General \r\nhas made a strong appeal for peace and the prevention \r\nof conflicts. We fully support him in that endeavour. \r\nConflict prevention must be at the core of actions of the \r\nUnited Nations in order to keep situations of concern \r\nfrom spiralling out of control. Saving human lives and \r\nupholding human dignity must be our common priority.\r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.9\r\n17-29400 13/21\r\nTools for prevention have long been available, \r\nincluding in the Charter of the United Nations, but \r\nwe need to move from mere commitments to preserve \r\na rules-based global order to actions to restore that \r\norder where it has been broken. Latvia will continue \r\nto promote democracy, good governance, human rights \r\nand the rule of law as key factors for global stability.\r\nSecurity is truly a global issue today. In particular, \r\nLatvia is deeply worried about the proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction and the threat of the use of \r\nnuclear weapons. North Korea’s actions have increased \r\nglobal insecurity. Latvia strongly condemns all nuclear \r\ntests and launches of ballistic missiles conducted by \r\nNorth Korea, as well as its continuous provocative \r\nrhetoric. We call on North Korea to return to a credible \r\nand meaningful dialogue with the international \r\ncommunity and to refrain from any further action that \r\nwould increase regional tensions. It is a priority to find \r\na peaceful and diplomatic solution to that situation. \r\nIn the meantime, all States must fully implement the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe use of chemical weapons in Syria, which \r\nblatantly disregards Syria’s obligations as a party to \r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, is a deplorable \r\ncrime that must be fully investigated. The perpetrators \r\nmust be held accountable. Latvia has constantly \r\ncalled for accountability regarding those attacks, an \r\naccountability that is closely linked to the credibility \r\nof the whole international system. For that reason, \r\nLatvia has supported the International, Impartial and \r\nIndependent Mechanism for the Syrian Arab Republic \r\nto assist the investigation and prosecution of serious \r\ncrimes committed in Syria. We will continue to support \r\nthe Syrian people and the United Nations-led political \r\nprocess towards a political resolution of that bloody \r\nconflict, which has lasted far too long.\r\nGlobal terrorism is one of the most serious threats \r\nto international peace and security. The unwavering \r\nefforts of the Global Coalition against Da’esh have \r\ndegraded the capabilities of Da’esh across all fronts. \r\nLatvia welcomes the important victories achieved, \r\nincluding the liberation of Mosul in Iraq. However, \r\nour fight is far from over, and we have to think about \r\nnew strategies and secure new domains as the threat \r\nof terrorism becomes more asymmetric and globally \r\ndispersed. Besides military efforts, we must continue \r\nto disrupt the f low of foreign terrorist fighters, \r\ndismantle financing networks and counter online \r\nand offline propaganda that sets youth on a path \r\ntowards radicalization.\r\nWe are pleased to see that the Riga Protocol on \r\nforeign terrorist fighters — the Additional Protocol to \r\nthe Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of \r\nTerrorism — entered into force in July. We encourage \r\nmore States to accede to that instrument in order to \r\naddress the threat at hand, which affects countries of \r\norigin and of destination.\r\nInternational support will be required to help \r\nstabilize liberated areas in Syria and Iraq in order to \r\nallow refugees and internally displaced persons to \r\nreturn and start rebuilding their lives. Latvia provides \r\ntraining to Iraqi security forces and financial support \r\nfor stabilization efforts.\r\nSolving existing conflicts is essential for \r\npreventing new ones. We must stand firm in upholding \r\nthe rules-based security order in Europe. The territorial \r\nintegrity of independent States must be respected by \r\nall, including by the Russian Federation. Russia’s \r\nunprovoked aggression against its neighbours is a \r\nserious breach of international security rules. There \r\nmust be accountability for violations of international \r\nlaw for any aggressor that initiates or sustains such \r\nconflicts.\r\nA peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine \r\nand respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity are priorities for Latvia. Russia’s continued \r\naggression in eastern Ukraine and the illegal annexation \r\nof Crimea and Sevastopol cannot become business as \r\nusual. We support diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis \r\nunder the Normandy format and within the framework \r\nof the Trilateral Contact Group so as to achieve the \r\nfull implementation of the Minsk agreements by all \r\nthe parties involved. International monitors must be \r\ngranted access to Crimea, and human rights violations \r\nagainst residents of Crimea, including Crimean Tatars, \r\nmust stop.\r\nThe United Nations, along with the relevant regional \r\nactors, should remain involved in, and committed to, \r\nfacilitating the resolution of the protracted conflicts in \r\nNagorno Karabakh, Transnistria, Abkhazia and South \r\nOssetia.\r\nLast year (see A/71/PV.12) I stressed that the \r\nstrengthening of the development and security nexus \r\nmust become our mission. Our priority must be to achieve \r\npeace and a decent life for everyone, including the most \r\nA/72/PV.9 20/09/2017\r\n14/21 17-29400\r\nvulnerable among us. We must tackle the root causes \r\npreventing us from attaining sustainable development. \r\nIf conflicts, hardship and poverty continue, migration \r\nand the f low of refugees will further increase. The far-\r\nreaching impact of climate change on global security \r\ncannot simply be disregarded. We must carry on with \r\nour joint commitment to tackle climate change so that \r\ncoming generations can live sustainably on this planet \r\nin a sustainable way. Latvia is fully committed to the \r\nimplementation of the Paris Agreement.\r\nNow is the time to put in place the mechanisms \r\nof implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. That needs to be done at \r\nall levels — national, regional and global — in true \r\npartnership with all stakeholders. We welcome the \r\ncurrent review of the United Nations development \r\nsystem to fulfil the ambitious goals of the 2030 Agenda. \r\nNext year Latvia will present a voluntary national review \r\nof the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to the United \r\nNations High-level Political Forum on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Our national focus is to put people first, as \r\nthat will lead to long-lasting development gains. Latvia \r\nis ready to share its experience with implementing the \r\n2030 Agenda through development cooperation.\r\nTo enjoy peace and development, our societies need \r\nspace and institutions for free, open and enlightened \r\npublic debate where truth can be sought, knowledge \r\nshared and lies exposed. Such belief is also at the \r\nheart of our approach to countering purposeful and \r\nmalicious propaganda and disinformation emanating \r\nfrom both State and non-State actors. Our answer to \r\nthat challenge is to reassert the fundamental principles \r\nof freedom of speech and press and the independence \r\nof the media. Both nationally and internationally, \r\nwe are committed to supporting the development of \r\nindependent, professional, transparent and objective \r\nmedia and journalism, and to increasing the resilience \r\nof our societies by investing in stronger critical thinking \r\nskills, as well as media and information literacy.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that Latvia remains \r\na strong advocate of the multilateral system and \r\nbelieves in an effective and efficient United Nations, \r\nguided by the values on which it was founded. It is time \r\nfor the United Nations to adapt to a changing global \r\nenvironment, focus on priorities and deliver results. \r\nThe Secretary-General cannot do that alone. We all \r\nmust work together to ensure that our Organization \r\nfunctions better and is fit for its purpose.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Latvia \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Raimonds Vējonis, President of the Republic \r\nof Latvia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the \r\nRepublic of South Africa\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica.\r\n Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic \r\nof South Africa, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Zuma: I take this opportunity to express \r\nSouth Africa’s solidarity with the fraternal Governments \r\nand the peoples of the Caribbean following waves of \r\ndevastating hurricanes that have resulted in loss of \r\nlife, injuries and serious damage to infrastructure and \r\nproperty. Our thoughts are also with the Government \r\nand the people of Mexico in the wake of the earthquake \r\nthat rocked Mexico City yesterday.\r\nI wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-second session. I assure you of South \r\nAfrica’s full support in the implementation of your \r\npriorities and responsibilities throughout your term. \r\nWe also commend Mr. Peter Thompson of Fiji for his \r\nexceptional leadership during the Assembly’s seventy-\r\nfirst session. I warmly congratulate Mr. António \r\nGuterres on his appointment as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We also congratulateMr. Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nsuccesssful tenure.\r\nWe have chosen an appropriate theme for \r\nthis debate, given the challenges facing the world \r\ntoday — “Focusing on people: Striving for peace and \r\na decent life for all on a sustainable planet”. The theme \r\nencompasses the three pillars of the United Nations: \r\npeace and security, humanitarian affairs and human \r\nrights, and socioeconomic and sustainable development.\r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.9\r\n17-29400 15/21\r\nThe adoption of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs), two years ago, in order to continue the \r\nunfinished business of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals marked a significant shift and historic moment \r\nin the life of the United Nations. We all committed \r\nourselves to addressing the challenges of poverty, \r\nunderdevelopment and inequality. However, a lot more \r\nstill needs to be done to promote a more equal and \r\njust socioeconomic world order so that we can achieve \r\nthe SDGs.\r\nThe current structure of the global economy \r\ncontinues to deepen the divide between the global \r\nNorth and global South. While a few enjoy the benefits \r\nof globalization, the majority of the peoples of the \r\nworld still live in abject poverty and hunger, with no \r\nhope of ever improving their living conditions. Even \r\nwithin developed countries, the gap between rich and \r\npoor remains wide and is of serious concern. We need \r\npolitical will and commitment from global leaders \r\nto address the challenges and obstacles posed by the \r\nuntransformed structure of the global economy, if we \r\nhope to achieve the goals and ambitions of 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development.\r\nThose unequal and unjust economic power relations \r\nmanifest themselves sharply in Africa. For example, \r\nour continent is endowed with mineral resources, \r\nbut it still has the highest number of least developed \r\ncountries. Many developed countries continue to \r\nfuel their development from the resources of the \r\nAfrican continent.\r\nThe continent also continues to lose a significant \r\nportion of its resources through illicit financial \r\noutf lows. Africa loses billions of dollars that it \r\notherwise would utilize to develop the continent and \r\nto provide for education, health care, housing and other \r\ncritical basic needs for the African populations.\r\nMoney laundering, tax evasion and tax avoidance, \r\ncorruption and transfer pricing by multinational \r\ncompanies are some of the biggest challenges to \r\neconomic growth and stability. They undermine the \r\nintegrity of the global financial system, efficient tax \r\ncollection and equitable allocation of resources. We \r\nappeal for the cooperation and commitment of every \r\nState Member of the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity at large to address that phenomenon. \r\nDeveloped countries in particular have a historical and \r\nmoral obligation to contribute to achieving a fair global \r\neconomic environment and to eradicate the scourge of \r\nillicit financial f lows from the continent.\r\nThe United Nations should also play a central role \r\nin addressing this problem. We therefore welcome the \r\nadoption by the General Assembly of resolution 71/213, \r\nentitled “Promotion on international cooperation \r\nto combat illicit financial f lows in order to foster \r\nsustainable development”. It is a preliminary step \r\ntowards a global architecture to tackle the scourge and \r\nimpacts of illicit financial f lows.\r\nThe issue of global peace and security continues \r\nto be one of the pillars of the United Nations agenda. \r\nSouth Africa reaffirms its commitment to cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and subregional \r\norganizations, particularly the African Union (AU), in \r\nmatters relating to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. We welcome the continued support \r\nfor the AU’s efforts to resolve conflicts on the African \r\ncontinent through promoting African solutions to \r\nAfrican problems and challenges. As Africans, we are \r\ndoing everything possible to reach our goal of silencing \r\nthe guns by 2020, as set out in our Agenda 2063, a \r\ncontinental blueprint for a peaceful, prosperous and \r\ndemocratic Africa. In that regard, we continue to make \r\nsignificant progress in resolving challenges to peace \r\nand security in our continent.\r\nWe hope that soon the sister people of Libya \r\nwill be able to live in peace and harmony in a united \r\nand democratic country. In 2011, the African Union \r\ncalled for dialogue to resolve the crisis in Libya. \r\nUnfortunately, some of us present here opted for guns \r\nand bombs, and today those countries are making little \r\neffort to promote stability in Libya. The major focus \r\nand preoccupation has become how to deal with the \r\nf low of migrants arriving in Europe from our continent \r\nand the Middle East, which is a mere symptom. \r\nThe war in Libya has contributed a great deal to the \r\ndestabilization of the Sahel region all the way to Central \r\nAfrica, creating a corridor for illicit arms trafficking \r\nand terrorist activities. In fact, had our warning been \r\nheeded that the supply of arms to civilians in Libya and \r\nthe arming of civilians in Syria would cause loss of life, \r\ngreat instability and mayhem, the world would be more \r\npeaceful today.\r\nSouth Africa continues to call for an immediate \r\nend to the violence and for a Syrian-led political \r\ntransition and a negotiated settlement that reflects the \r\nwill of the Syrian people. In both instances — of Libya \r\nA/72/PV.9 20/09/2017\r\n16/21 17-29400\r\nand Syria — we strongly cautioned against seeking \r\nto resolve internal challenges of sovereign States by \r\nimposing foreign solutions through military means. \r\nIt is hoped that lessons will be learned from those \r\ntragic episodes in order to make the world a more \r\npeaceful place.\r\nWe continue our call for calm on the Korean \r\npeninsula. The situation cannot be allowed to get out \r\nof hand. As a country that voluntarily dismantled its \r\nnuclear-weapon programme, South Africa is of the \r\nfirm view that there are no safe hands for weapons \r\nof mass destruction. The only viable solution to the \r\nproblems of nuclear weapons is their total elimination, \r\nas expressed in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, recently adopted by the United Nations \r\nconference to negotiate a legally binding instrument to \r\nprohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total \r\nelimination. It can no longer be acceptable that a few \r\ncountries maintain arsenals and stockpiles of nuclear \r\nweapons as part of their strategic defence and security \r\ndoctrine, while expecting others to remain at their \r\nmercy. We are concerned that any possible accidental \r\ndetonation would lead to a disaster of epic proportions.\r\nWe are making a clarion call to all States Members \r\nof the United Nations to sign and ratify the nuclear-\r\nweapon-ban treaty in order to rid the world and \r\nhumankind of these lethal weapons of mass destruction. \r\nAt the same time, we reaffirm the inalienable right \r\nof States to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, as \r\nreinforced in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons. South Africa is today proud to be \r\nthe biggest producer of medical isotopes used in the \r\ntreatment of cancer patients globally. We will continue \r\nto harness the peaceful uses of atoms in addressing \r\nchallenges of socioeconomic development.\r\nAs we stand here, the Security Council is paralysed \r\nand unable to carry out its Charter responsibilities for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nWe remain steadfast in our call for the reform of that \r\ncritical organ of the United Nations. We hope that the \r\nSecretary-General, working with the entire membership, \r\ncan provide some impetus towards fulfilling this long-\r\nawaited ideal. Failure to do so will result in the United \r\nNations irreversibly losing its legitimacy.\r\nMr. Biang (Gabon), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nWe take this opportunity to express our empathy \r\nand solidarity with all the victims of the devastating \r\nhurricanes, monsoons, f loods and droughts as a result \r\nof climate change. Those phenomena are proof that \r\nclimate change is real and that, if we do not act now, \r\nfuture generations will suffer untold consequences. The \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change is a milestone in \r\nthe history of efforts to address climate change and all \r\nits consequences. We should resist all efforts to unravel \r\nand undermine the Paris Agreement. Our efforts should \r\nbe directed at the mobilization of the resources required \r\nfor its implementation.\r\nFor South Africa, the seventy-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly coincides with the centenary of Oliver \r\nReginald Tambo, who led our liberation movement, \r\nthe African National Congress, for three decades in \r\nthe struggle against apartheid and racism in South \r\nAfrica. O.R. Tambo travelled all over the continent of \r\nAfrica and the globe, mobilizing international support \r\nfor the struggle against racial discrimination and the \r\noppressive apartheid regime. He strongly believed in \r\nthe role of multilateralism and in the centrality of the \r\nUnited Nations. It was for that reason that he spent a \r\nlot of time in the rooms and corridors of this United \r\nNations building, mobilizing members to take firm \r\naction against the apartheid regime in South Africa. \r\nAs we celebrate what would have been O.R. Tambo’s \r\none-hundredth birthday, we take this opportunity as \r\na country once again to thank the United Nations and \r\nthe international community for their support for and \r\nsolidarity with our struggle for liberation.\r\nIf O.R. Tambo were still alive today, he would \r\nhave pleaded with the Organization to do all it can to \r\nsupport the struggle of the Palestinian people against \r\noccupation and to support the struggle of the people of \r\nWestern Sahara. The world has preached a two-State \r\nsolution for the situation in Palestine, yet we have seen \r\nthe expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory. We appeal to the General \r\nAssembly that the same resolve shown in supporting \r\nthe South African struggle for liberation should be \r\nshown towards ending the apartheid practices against \r\nthe people of Palestine.\r\nWe also wish to remind the General Assembly \r\nthat the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-\r\ndetermination continues to be undermined, challenged \r\nand denied. The United Nations must remain seized \r\nwith that issue, for the benefit of the people of Western \r\nSahara and the African aspirations for integration and \r\npeaceful coexistence.\r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.9\r\n17-29400 17/21\r\nI also wish to register South Africa’s disappointment \r\nat the decision of the United States Administration in \r\nJune to reverse the progress that was made in the past \r\ntwo years towards ending the Cuban blockade.\r\nSouth Africa stands ready to work with the United \r\nNations to promote peace, human rights and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. As said by our liberation icon Oliver \r\nReginald Tambo,\r\n“We seek to live in peace with our neighbours and \r\nthe peoples of the world in conditions of equality, \r\nmutual respect and equal advantage.”\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of South Africa for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hage Geingob, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Namibia.\r\nMr. Hage Geingob, President of the Republic of \r\nNamibia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Hage Geingob, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Namibia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Geingob: The President made a profound \r\nstatement in saying,\r\n“The United Nations was created for people. Its job \r\nis to help people who are striving for peace and a \r\ndecent life, on a sustainable planet.”\r\nNamibia congratulates Mr. Lajčák on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-second \r\nsession. We pledge our full support to advancing a \r\npeople-centred approach to doing business at the United \r\nNations. We also commend His Excellency Mr. Peter \r\nThomson for his outstanding stewardship during his \r\ntenure as President of the General Assembly.\r\nYesterday the Secretary-General stressed his \r\ncommitment towards global unity and multilateralism \r\nby saying,\r\n“We call ourselves the international community. \r\nWe must act as one, because only together, as united \r\nnations, can we fulfil the promise of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and advance human dignity for \r\nall.” (A/72/PV.3, p. 4)\r\nAs the people of Namibia, we will do everything within \r\nour capabilities to support his noble cause during his \r\ntenure as Secretary-General of the Organization. We \r\nalso congratulate Ms. Amina Mohamed, a daughter of \r\nAfrica, for her well-deserved appointment as Deputy \r\nSecretary-General. Let us also not forget His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon and the sterling job he did during his \r\ntenure as Secretary-General.\r\nDevelopment that is not driven by the people and \r\ndoes not translate into improved living conditions for \r\nall people is meaningless development. Moreover, \r\ndevelopment that does not reach all people in an \r\nequitable manner will only undermine the peace \r\nand stability necessary for sustainable development. \r\nGrowing income disparities, between and within \r\nnations, pose the greatest threat to peace within \r\ncountries and globally.\r\nWe in Namibia overcame the inhumane scourge \r\nof colonial oppression and racial segregation. Through \r\na deliberate policy of national reconciliation, we \r\nsucceeded in entrenching peace, security and stability \r\nas the pillars of our democracy. We also made \r\nsignificant progress in reducing absolute and relative \r\npoverty during the past 27 years. Poverty declined from \r\na high of 70 per cent in 1993 to 18 per cent in 2015. \r\nThat was in part due to the introduction of a wide range \r\nof social safety nets that cover close to 16 per cent of \r\nthe entire population. While income inequality also \r\ndeclined during the same period, it did not decline by \r\nthe same magnitude as poverty.\r\nWe have come to realize that, as long as we \r\ncontinue to have poverty in Namibia, even if it is just \r\n10 per cent, we can never have lasting peace and social \r\njustice. Similarly, as long as the wealth of the country \r\nis disproportionately in the hands of a few, we cannot \r\nhave lasting peace and stability. It is for that reason that \r\nwe have declared full-scale war against poverty and \r\nincome inequality. We have also declared full-scale \r\nwar against corruption, because corruption is one of the \r\nroot causes of poverty and inequality.\r\nA/72/PV.9 20/09/2017\r\n18/21 17-29400\r\nIn line with the belief that people must be at the \r\ncentre of development, we have coined the phrase “No \r\nNamibian should feel left out”. The logic is simple, \r\nfor inclusivity spells harmony and peace, whereas \r\nexclusivity spells disaster, conflict and potential war. \r\nTherefore, we commend the President for his choice of a \r\ntheme for this session: “Focusing on people: Striving for \r\npeace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet”.\r\nIn a climate of ever-increasing uncertainty and \r\nunpredictability, it is incumbent upon world leaders \r\nto renew faith in multilateralism. The United Nations \r\nmatters most because it is at the centre of the needs and \r\ndesires of humankind. Therefore, it must be inclusive \r\nby including Africa at the highest decision-making \r\nlevel. By failing to do so, the United Nations runs the \r\nrisk of losing its respectability. The only sure way \r\nto restore trust in the United Nations will be for the \r\nSecurity Council to become more inclusive.\r\nThe people of Namibia can testify to the importance \r\nof multilateralism. Namibia is a child of international \r\nsolidarity, conceived through the valiant struggle of \r\nNamibian patriots, delivered by resolution 435 (1978) \r\nand midwifed by the United Nations. Today, thanks \r\nto the support of the international community, we are \r\nan independent nation founded on the principles of \r\ndemocracy, unity, stability, peace and the rule of law.\r\nPeople-centred development should not extend \r\nto only a small part of the population. It must cover \r\nall demographic components. Too often, the largest \r\ndemographic component in our societies — namely, \r\nour mothers, sisters and daughters — are excluded from \r\ndevelopment. In Namibia, we believe that gender equity \r\nis equally important for a stable and harmonious society. \r\nA policy decision by the ruling party to introduce 50-50 \r\nrepresentation at all party levels has led to a significant \r\nimprovement in the representation of females to \r\n48 per cent in Namibia’s National Assembly. That is the \r\nsecond-highest level of representation on the continent \r\nand among the top five in the world.\r\nTo give further meaning to that policy directive, \r\nwomen have also been appointed to key positions in \r\nthe executive branch. That includes the young Prime \r\nMinister and the Deputy Prime Minster — who is \r\nalso the Minister for International Relations and \r\nCooperation — the Minister and Deputy Minister for \r\nEducation, Arts and Culture, the Minister and Deputy \r\nMinister for Higher Education, Science and Technology, \r\nthe Minister and Deputy Minister for Urban and Rural \r\nDevelopment and the Minister for Home Affairs and \r\nImmigration. Those are powerful positions.\r\nAnother significant demographic component that \r\nwe must not neglect is the youth. We in Namibia value \r\nthe empowerment of the youth. Many of the so-called \r\nolder guard had been groomed and well prepared in \r\nthe structures of the ruling party and the Government \r\nbefore they were assigned higher responsibilities. That \r\npractice continues with a number of young deputy \r\nministers. Our Attorney General is one of the youngest \r\nin the world. Very soon, the last crop of the Tanganyika \r\ngroup — the freedom fighters of the 1960s, including \r\nmyself — will make way for the new breed.\r\nWhen we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and acceded to the Paris Agreement, we \r\nnot only reaffirmed the centrality of multilateralism; \r\nwe also reaffirmed the reality of climate change. What \r\nhas happened in Sierra Leone, the Caribbean and some \r\nparts of the United States — and we must also note the \r\nrecent earthquake in Mexico — serve as grim reminders \r\nthat climate change is real. We have witnessed the \r\nstripping away of human dignity, security and hope. We \r\nmust increase our resolve to address the challenges of \r\nclimate change.\r\nIn order to achieve the ambitions of living on a \r\nsustainable planet, peace processes and international \r\npeacebuilding must be strengthened. We recognize \r\nthe contribution of women in promoting global peace, \r\nboth in peace negotiations and through their active \r\nparticipation in peace missions. Namibia supports \r\nefforts to increase the representation of women \r\nin peace missions around the world, especially in \r\nleadership positions.\r\nOut of 52 United Nations peacekeeping and \r\nspecial political missions, 26 are in Africa. Therefore, \r\nwe recognize the institutional partnership between \r\nthe Security Council and the African Union in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The \r\npartnership not only enhances cooperation between \r\nthe two institutions, but also adds greater legitimacy \r\nto the decisions taken by the Security Council \r\nregarding Africa.\r\nAfrica should not be seen only as a source of \r\nprecious primary commodities but as an important \r\nand equal partner of the international community \r\nwith concrete contributions to make. In that context, \r\nwe welcome the recent Joint United Nations-African \r\nUnion Framework for Enhanced Partnership in Peace \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.9\r\n17-29400 19/21\r\nand Security, signed by the Secretary-General and the \r\nChairperson of the African Union Commission, which \r\nwill enhance coordination between the Africa Union \r\nand the United Nations.\r\nNamibia stands together with the international \r\nconsensus that the Israeli occupation of Palestine must \r\nend. We reiterate that statehood and independence \r\nare the national, inalienable and legal rights of the \r\nPalestinian people. We join the call for the two-\r\nState solution to be pursued with renewed vigour and \r\ndetermination.\r\nSimilarly, the people of Western Sahara cannot \r\ncontinue to have their inalienable rights to self-\r\ndetermination and national independence denied. \r\nNamibia reaffirms its full and unequivocal support \r\nfor the rights of the people of Western Sahara to self-\r\ndetermination. We call for the urgent implementation of \r\nall Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, \r\nwith the aim of holding a free and fair referendum in \r\nWestern Sahara.\r\nOver the past several years, Namibia has been \r\nnoting the growing rapprochement between Cuba and \r\nthe United States, which culminated in the reopening \r\nof embassies in the two countries. We believe that those \r\nefforts should lead to the full lifting of the economic \r\nand financial embargo against the Republic of Cuba \r\nand its people, who have the right to pursue peace and \r\na decent life.\r\nNamibia is committed to supporting the \r\nOrganization in its efforts to achieve global peace. As \r\nAlbert Einstein once said, “Peace cannot be kept by \r\nforce; it can only be achieved through understanding”. \r\nLet us therefore try to be more tolerant and embrace \r\ndiverse views through dialogue and understanding, \r\nbefore hastily embarking upon a path of force, which \r\nwill lead  only to conflict and, eventually, to war.\r\nThe United Nations is a great social experiment. \r\nIt features small and large nations coexisting in peace \r\nand harmony. If the United Nations did not exist today, \r\nI would definitely call for the creation of such an \r\norganization. Let us continue to treasure the unity of \r\nthe United Nations, for it is only through unity that we \r\nwill bring about a world free from fear and conflict. It \r\nis only through unity that we will bring about a world \r\nfree from hunger and poverty. It is only through unity \r\nthat we will deliver a sustainable planet for our children \r\nand their children.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Namibia for the statement just made.\r\nMr. Hage Geingob, President of the Republic of \r\nNamibia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Filip Vujanović, President of \r\nMontenegro\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nMontenegro.\r\nMr. Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Filip \r\nVujanović, President of Montenegro, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vujanović (spoke in Montenegrin; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is my \r\npleasure to address the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session and to reiterate Montenegro’s \r\nstrong commitment to the values of the United Nations.\r\nAs one of the newest Members of the Organization, \r\nMontenegro actively contributes to maintaining \r\npeace and security in its region. Good-neighbourly \r\nrelations and regional cooperation are at the top our \r\nforeign-policy agenda. We are strongly committed to \r\nmultilateral cooperation and affirm our support for \r\ninternational organizations that contribute to peace and \r\nstability.\r\nIt is of great importance for Montenegro that it has \r\nbecome the twenty-ninth member of the North Atlantic \r\nAlliance. As a member of the Alliance, my country will \r\ncontinue to improve its cooperation and partnership \r\nwith United Nations peacekeeping operations and \r\nwith regional organizations dedicated to establishing \r\nand maintaining peace and stability. At the same time, \r\nMontenegro has proved to be a reliable partner of the \r\nEuropean Union. Accession negotiations have already \r\nensured significant economic benefits.\r\nThe international community is facing complex \r\nchallenges such as long-term conflicts, terrorism \r\nand violent extremism, refugee crises, the systematic \r\nviolation of human rights, and poverty. The United \r\nA/72/PV.9 20/09/2017\r\n20/21 17-29400\r\nNations, which was established to prevent war and \r\nhuman suffering, should adjust more quickly in \r\nresponse to those challenges and adopt new mechanisms \r\nto prevent conflicts and resolve long-term crises.\r\nThe United Nations and international and regional \r\neconomic organizations have new responsibilities today. \r\nPeace, stability, achieving sustainable and inclusive \r\ngrowth and improving international economic relations \r\nare the basic elements for achieving the goals set forth \r\nin the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is \r\ntherefore of great importance to carry out the successful \r\nimplementation of the process of reforming the United \r\nNations — and its affiliates the International Monetary \r\nFund and the World Bank — in order to achieve more \r\nequitable economic growth, poverty eradication and \r\nwomen’s economic empowerment, as well as to bridge \r\nthe technological gap between countries and regions.\r\nMontenegro remains dedicated to United Nations \r\nefforts aimed at implementing the ambitious reform \r\nagenda, including the strengthening of the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the enlargement of the Security \r\nCouncil, in accordance with the principles of equitable \r\nregional representation. Successful cooperation \r\nbetween Montenegro and the United Nations system \r\ncontinues in the framework of the Delivering as One \r\ninitiative. Positive results of this programme are visible \r\nand recognized by many States Members of the United \r\nNations.\r\nMontenegro is part of a region whose experience \r\nhas shown that dialogue and cooperation are possible \r\nand that they are the only way to overcome differences \r\nand achieve peace and lasting solutions to problems. \r\nAccordingly, early next year, we will organize a regional \r\nconference with a view to sharing our experience \r\nand helping to define new mechanisms for conflict \r\nprevention and resolution.\r\nEfforts aimed at preventing terrorism must \r\nbe focused on its causes. That is the particular \r\nresponsibility of the countries from which the terrorist \r\nthreats emerge, but the international community should \r\nalso offer needed help. We therefore highly appreciate \r\nthe establishment, upon the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, of the Office of Counter-Terrorism, which \r\nwill enable strong leadership and a connection between \r\nthe United Nations and its Members as they strive to \r\nprevent conflicts and terrorism.\r\nMontenegro unequivocally supports the efforts \r\naimed at the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nprovides a foundation for the improvement of global \r\nstability. Montenegro has defined its national framework \r\nin this area by adopting a strategy of non-proliferation \r\nof weapons of mass destruction for the period 2016 to \r\n2020, including an action plan for its implementation.\r\nMontenegro strongly condemns the nuclear-weapon \r\ntests conducted by North Korea as acts that violate \r\ninternational obligations pursuant to Security Council \r\nresolutions. Those tests pose a serious threat to global \r\npeace and security. We support diplomatic efforts aimed \r\nat calming the current situation and call on North Korea \r\nto fully respect its international obligations.\r\nHighly important multilateral agreements that \r\nhave been adopted confirm that multilateralism is \r\ncrucial and essential for achieving peace, inclusive \r\nsustainable growth and respect for human rights. \r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the \r\nSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and \r\nthe Paris Climate Agreement constitute a universal \r\nplatform for transformation and progress. For their full \r\nimplementation to be achieved, therefore, it is necessary \r\nto secure the utmost commitment of all Member States, \r\nas well as considerable financial resources.\r\nMontenegro strongly supported the negotiations \r\non a new international accord on climate change. The \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change is a foundation \r\nfor further efforts in long-term climate preservation. I \r\nhad the pleasure and honour to participate, on behalf of \r\nMontenegro, in the historic Conference in Paris, when \r\nthe Agreement was adopted, and to take part in its \r\nsigning ceremony at Headquarters. As part of the efforts \r\nto mitigate climate change, Montenegro financially \r\ncontributes to the Trust Fund of the Intergovernmental \r\nPanel on Climate Change.\r\nRespect for human rights is a precondition for peace, \r\nstability and development. The full implementation \r\nof the international standards and norms relating to \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights is an \r\nobligation for every country. We are committed to the \r\nmultilateral system for the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights, in particular among the most vulnerable \r\ngroups, and therefore attach special importance to \r\npoverty eradication and the fight against discrimination.\r\nWe also attach special importance to strengthening \r\nthe position and role of women in society, the \r\nprevention of violence against women, child protection \r\nand development and the fight against discrimination \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.9\r\n17-29400 21/21\r\nof the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex \r\npopulation and individuals with disabilities. We \r\nespecially appreciate the joint initiative of the European \r\nUnion and the United Nations to eliminate all forms \r\nof violence against women and girls and the launch of \r\nthe global alliance to end trade in tools of torture and \r\ncapital punishment.\r\nI am certain that its improvement of human \r\nrights protection and respect for individuals renders \r\nMontenegro a strong candidate for membership of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for the period 2022-2024. That \r\nwas also confirmed by the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights, who said that Montenegro was one of 33 \r\nUnited Nations Members to send regular reports on the \r\nimplementation of international agreements concerning \r\nhuman rights.\r\nWe attach special importance to developing key \r\ndocuments on refugees and migrants and point out the \r\nnecessity of a comprehensive approach, while taking \r\ninto account the development, humanitarian, security \r\nand human rights dimensions. Based on our experience \r\nand in cooperation with the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, we are ready \r\nto make a concrete contribution to drafting two global \r\ncompacts.\r\nIts enormous obligation to offer humanitarian \r\nassistance to civilians in conflicts and natural disasters \r\nobliges the United Nations to reinforce mechanisms \r\nfor humanitarian aid. Montenegro actively participated \r\nin the first World Humanitarian Summit, held last \r\nyear. The Summit confirmed the need for efficient \r\ncoordination of international humanitarian assistance. \r\nMontenegro has therefore invested significant efforts \r\nthis year into ensuring that there are appropriate \r\nlegislative and strategic frameworks for planning \r\nin place for managing and financing international \r\ndevelopment cooperation and humanitarian assistance.\r\nFinally, on behalf of Montenegro and on my own \r\nbehalf, allow me to extend our congratulations to \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election as the President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. \r\nHis persistent commitment to dialogue and cooperation \r\nunequivocally confirms that he will be very successful \r\nin his high office. I would also like to express great \r\nappreciation to the former President, Mr. Peter \r\nThomson, for his achievements in the work related to \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nI take this opportunity to reiterate my most sincere \r\ncongratulations to new Secretary-General, Mr. António \r\nGuterres. I am convinced that his rich professional \r\nexperience, leadership and commitment will contribute \r\nto the work and results of the United Nations at this time \r\nwhen the world faces complex challenges. I also express \r\nmy sincere gratitude to former Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his overall contribution to achieving the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations, as well \r\nas for his support for Montenegro. I wish the General \r\nAssembly a successful seventy-second session.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof Montenegro for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
