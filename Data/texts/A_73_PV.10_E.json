"United Nations A/73/PV.10\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n10th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 27 September 2018, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Korneliou \r\n(Cyprus), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Ms. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of \r\nthe Republic of Lithuania\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania.\r\nMs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Ms. Dalia Grybauskaitė, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Lithuania, and to invite her \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Grybauskaitė: This November the \r\nworld will commemorate the centenary of the end \r\nof the First World War. The war caused the fall of \r\nempires and opened a window for small nations in \r\nEurope, including Lithuania, to achieve their dreams of \r\nliving independently and freely, enjoying their culture \r\nand traditions.\r\nTo prevent such a war from ever happening again, \r\nmultilateral institutions were created to safeguard \r\npolitical independence and territorial integrity. Yet \r\nwhen the world faced its next big crisis, those institutions \r\nfailed to act and remained powerless bystanders as \r\nhumankind plunged into another world war.\r\nToday we would like to think that our multilateral \r\ninstitutions, including the United Nations, are strong \r\nenough to take a stand against aggression and a \r\ndisregard of international rules. But sometimes reality \r\ntells a different story. We see a world that is more \r\nfractured, with institutions that are crumbling, instead \r\nof one that is sheltering us from the use of force and from \r\neconomic storms. In almost every major crisis of the \r\npast decade, from Syria to Ukraine and from Myanmar \r\nto Yemen, the Security Council has been unable to play \r\na meaningful role because of the inability of States to \r\nrise above their national interests and because of the \r\nobstructive use of the veto power.\r\nOrganizations created to abolish weapons of mass \r\ndestruction are toothless against dictators who develop \r\nnuclear arms and use chemical weapons on civilians. \r\nAs the tide begins to turn for the global economy, the \r\nWorld Trade Organization is starting to face paralysis. \r\nRising global tensions in trade could wipe away \r\nour achievements in sustainable development and \r\npoverty reduction.\r\nWe must therefore recognize that our institutions \r\nare not perfect. They can be bureaucratic, wasteful and \r\nunaccountable. But it was us, the Member States, that \r\ncreated them, and so it is up to us alone to improve and \r\nadapt them to new realities. Before we seek to destroy \r\nmultilateral institutions, commitments or agreements, \r\nwe must have a clear vision of what we want to build \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Otherwise we will end up living on a pile \r\nof ruins.\r\nWe cannot reject globalization, because fighting it \r\nwill only make us poorer. Over the past 25 years, free \r\ntrade has given more than 1 billion people an opportunity \r\nto escape extreme poverty. However, globalization \r\nalso has a dark side, which must be confronted by \r\nacting against exclusion, inequality and falling labour \r\nstandards. We cannot let the voices of nationalism \r\nand division win over dialogue and cooperation. On \r\nall major challenges — terrorism, climate change and \r\nfemale empowerment — there is simply no alternative \r\nto working together.\r\nSo far we have been too quiet, too passive and too \r\nignorant. We must stop taking the easy way out, blaming \r\ninstitutions for our own political or domestic failures. \r\nWe must recognize that we, the Member States, have \r\nthe power and resources to enable the United Nations to \r\nstand up for peace, freedom, equality and humankind, \r\nbecause we are the United Nations. Let us take this \r\nopportunity and assume responsibility for our future, \r\nempowering the United Nations to act.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Botswana\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic \r\nof Botswana.\r\nMr. Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi, President \r\nof the Republic of Botswana, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe \r\nMasisi, President of the Republic of Botswana, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Masisi: It is indeed an honour and \r\nprivilege for me to address the General Assembly for \r\nthe first time in my capacity as the President of the \r\nRepublic of Botswana, after assuming office on 1 April. \r\nI succeeded our former President Lieutenant General \r\nSerêtsê Khama Ian Khama, who retired at the end of \r\nhis term in office. It was the fifth time that Botswana \r\nhas witnessed a smooth transfer of power since its \r\nindependence, in 1966.\r\nAllow me to join other delegations in paying tribute \r\nto the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who passed away on 18 August. \r\nMr. Annan will be remembered as an international \r\nstatesman and an icon who devoted his entire life to \r\nserving humankind.\r\nLet me also join other delegations in congratulating \r\nMs. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-third \r\nsession. Her election is particularly noteworthy as this \r\nis only the fourth time a woman has held the position \r\nsince the founding of our world body, 73 years ago, and \r\nshe is the first woman to do so from the Latin American \r\nand Caribbean region. I would like to assure her of the \r\nfull support and cooperation of my delegation as she \r\ndischarges her mandate, and we wish her every success.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to thank His \r\nExcellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, who competently \r\npresided over the deliberations of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-second session.\r\nI also wish to thank our Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. António Guterres, for his outstanding \r\nleadership and stewardship of the United Nations. I \r\nwant especially to commend him for the reforms that \r\nhe has initiated, which are aimed at improving the \r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the Organization.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the theme of the general \r\ndebate of the seventy-third session of the General \r\nAssembly, “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. We are \r\nparticularly pleased to note that it builds on last year’s \r\ntheme, which also focused on people and emphasized \r\nthe nexus between peace and a decent life for everyone \r\non the planet. That shows the steadfast commitment \r\nof the United Nations to ensuring sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all. Clearly, the principle of leaving \r\nno one behind should remain our long-term aspiration. \r\nIt is a clarion call for us to end extreme poverty and \r\nensure the provision of quality education, health care, \r\ninfrastructure, housing and employment for all.\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 3/59\r\nI am pleased that the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals Report 2018 indicates that there are more people \r\nliving healthier lives today than there were a decade \r\nago. However, we should be reminded that much \r\nmore still needs to be done to achieve prosperity for \r\nall, especially in view of the fact that an estimated \r\n783 million people live in extreme poverty, 2.3 billion \r\nstill lack access to basic levels of sanitation services \r\nand 4 billion are without social protection.\r\nIt is therefore apparent that none of us, whether \r\nbig or small, can overcome those gigantic development \r\nchallenges alone. Consequently, we need to act together \r\nto strengthen multilateralism and honour and implement \r\nthe commitments made by the General Assembly and \r\nglobal partnerships for sustainable development.\r\nIt is also imperative that the global community \r\ncontinue to support individual countries, taking into \r\naccount their unique development challenges. For \r\ninstance, while Botswana is classified as an upper-\r\nmiddle-income country, it is still dealing with many \r\ndevelopment challenges comparable to those of less-\r\ndeveloped countries. However, we are reassured by the \r\nwords the Secretary-General used when he said that the \r\nUnited Nations\r\n“stands ready to work with all Member States to \r\nmake the Sustainable Development Goals a reality \r\nfor everyone, everywhere”.\r\nIn view of the development challenges facing \r\nmy country, I want to reiterate our appeal for \r\ncontinued support in human capital, infrastructure \r\nand capacity development for the private sector and \r\ntechnology transfer.\r\nOn sustainable development, Botswana reaffirms \r\nits commitment to the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. Accordingly, we \r\nhave aligned our national Vision 2036 with that global \r\nAgenda. At the regional level, we are also pleased that \r\nthe African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community’s integration \r\nagenda are also aligned with the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nWhat those development agendas have in common \r\nis that they are aimed at eradicating poverty and creating \r\ninclusive, prosperous and peaceful societies. In that \r\nrespect, we are pleased to note that extreme poverty \r\ncontinues to decline across the globe, even though we \r\nstill have a long way to go, given that 35 per cent of \r\nAfrica’s population — 395 million people — still live \r\nin abject poverty.\r\nAs we begin the third year of the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, my \r\nGovernment remains steadfast in its resolve to improve \r\nthe material and social well-being of Botswana’s \r\npopulation. Our national development agenda places \r\n“people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership” at \r\nthe heart of sustainable development. In that regard, \r\nour national Vision 2036 is anchored to four pillars: \r\nsustainable economic development; human and social \r\ndevelopment; sustainable environment; and governance, \r\npeace and security.\r\nIn addition, we have six national priorities that are \r\naligned with our national Vision pillars — developing \r\ndiversified sources of economic growth, human capital \r\ndevelopment and social development, the sustainable \r\nuse of national resources, the consolidation of good \r\ngovernance, strengthening national security and \r\nthe implementation of an effective monitoring and \r\nevaluation system. With those in mind, our sustainable \r\ndevelopment pathway strikes a balance among \r\nthe social, human, economic, environmental and \r\ngovernance dimensions.\r\nThe implementation of our national Vision 2036 and \r\nthe eleventh national development plan is underpinned \r\nby a robust monitoring and evaluation system to ensure \r\nthe effective delivery of these programmes’ goals \r\nand aspirations. Additionally, we have established a \r\nnational steering committee to effectively coordinate \r\nand monitor the implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). We have also developed \r\nBotswana’s SDGs road map, which is a guide for the \r\nachievement of the goals contained within the SDGs, \r\ncovering the period from 2017 to 2036.\r\nMy Government has adopted a comprehensive \r\nand inclusive approach to the implementation and \r\nmonitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nIt aims to ensure broad ownership and leadership \r\nat the local, community and national levels and to \r\nbreak down silos across the development spectrum by \r\nforging strategic partnerships among the Government, \r\nacademia, civil society organizations, community-\r\nbased organizations, development partners, the private \r\nsector, non-State actors and the United Nations system. \r\nIn pursuit of those goals and aspirations, we have \r\ngiven priority to economic diversification, sustainable \r\neconomic growth, employment creation and investment \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n4/59 18-30067\r\nin human capital with a view to building a prosperous \r\nand inclusive society.\r\nIn particular, the focus is on our young people, who \r\nconstitute 60 per cent of the population of Botswana. \r\nIn that regard, our ultimate goal is to attain universal \r\naccess to pre-primary, primary and secondary \r\neducation. We are also expanding access to tertiary, \r\ntechnical and vocational education and training. In \r\naddition, we are developing a national employment \r\npolicy, the objective of which is to assist Botswana in \r\nreaching gainful and productive employment and decent \r\nwork for all. Above all, the Government of Botswana \r\nhas developed several policies, programmes and \r\nstrategies, such as our economic diversification drive \r\ninitiative, our citizen economic empowerment policy, \r\nyouth empowerment scheme and youth development \r\nfund, to support sustainable economic development and \r\nemployment creation.\r\nTo ensure that development benefits all, my \r\nGovernment continues to make substantial investments \r\nin the provision of health care, decent housing and \r\nshelter through interventions such as the Treat All \r\nStrategy, preventing mother-to-child transmission \r\nof HIV, a self-help housing agency and a programme \r\nto house the destitute. Additionally, the Government \r\nprovides social protection to such vulnerable groups \r\nas children, young persons, the elderly and persons \r\nliving with disabilities through a policy addressing \r\nout-of-school children, the orphan-care programme \r\nand the old-age pension scheme. Other development \r\ninterventions aimed at increasing access to economic \r\nand social opportunities include poverty eradication, \r\nwomen and youth empowerment, and a national policy \r\non gender and development.\r\nFurthermore, we are giving priority to investments \r\nin research and development, science, technology and \r\ninnovation in order to transform Botswana into a high-\r\nincome-status nation and knowledge-based economy. \r\nInvestment in information and communications \r\ntechnology is undertaken to promote growth and \r\neconomic diversification and to support e-Government \r\nservices and innovation in the economy.\r\nWe note that the implementation of the ambitious \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development faces \r\nimmense constraints in terms of resources and \r\ncapacity. In that respect, we welcome the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations to address those challenges through the \r\nadoption of resolution 72/279, on the repositioning of \r\nthe United Nations development system, in May 2018. \r\nThe resolution is vital in that it aims at supporting \r\ncountries in their efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. It is our firm conviction \r\nthat strengthened United Nations country teams and \r\nreinvigorated Resident Coordinator systems will \r\ncontribute significantly to the achievement of the SDGs.\r\nBotswana also welcomes the signing of the \r\nAfrican Union-United Nations Framework for the \r\nImplementation of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development to ensure the effective \r\ncoordination, execution and monitoring of those \r\ntwo instruments as well as reporting on them. That \r\ncoordination will hopefully ensure that there is no \r\nduplication of effort, thereby allowing for the effective \r\nuse of our already limited resources.\r\nOn human rights, Botswana remains committed \r\nto the promotion and protection of human rights, \r\ndemocracy, good governance and the rule of law, which \r\nare critical to sustainable development, prosperity and \r\npeaceful societies. In that regard, we continue to support \r\nefforts aimed at fighting impunity and at implementing \r\nthe principle of the responsibility to protect populations \r\nfrom such atrocities as genocide, war crimes, ethnic \r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity. Accordingly, we \r\nreaffirm our full support for the Human Rights Council \r\nand the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC \r\nachieved a milestone this year when it commemorated \r\nthe twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the \r\nRome Statute, which founded the Court. Since its \r\nestablishment, in 2002, the International Criminal \r\nCourt has contributed significantly to the strengthening \r\nof the international criminal justice system through its \r\nprosecution of grave international crimes.\r\nOn international peace and security, Botswana \r\nremains deeply concerned about the protracted conflicts \r\nin Afghanistan, Mali, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It \r\nis estimated that over the past decade, violent conflicts \r\nhave led to the forced displacement of over 68.5 million \r\npeople. Studies show that conflicts contribute to \r\nincreases in slums, hunger and food insecurity, thereby \r\nworsening humanitarian crises. We therefore urge all \r\nparties to those conflicts to uphold their obligation \r\nto protect civilians and humanitarian personnel, in \r\naccordance with international human rights law and \r\ninternational humanitarian law. We also want to stress \r\nthat dialogue and the peaceful resolution of conflicts \r\nare critical to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security.\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 5/59\r\nWe want to commend the Secretary-General for \r\ninitiating reforms of the peace and security pillar aimed \r\nat strengthening United Nations capacities in conflict \r\nprevention and resolution, mediation, peacekeeping, \r\npeacemaking, post-conflict reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment, peacebuilding and sustaining peace. To \r\nbolster international peacemaking efforts, African \r\nleaders have committed themselves to funding 25 per \r\ncent of peace support operations in Africa by 2021 \r\nand to silencing the guns by 2020. I therefore want to \r\napplaud regional organizations for their commitment to \r\nthat noble cause.\r\nWith regard to corruption, as a global community \r\nwe need to address the problems of illicit financial \r\nf lows, money-laundering and corruption, which are \r\nhaemorrhaging the resources needed to implement \r\nthe SDGs. Among other things, SDG 16 calls for a \r\nsubstantial reduction of corruption and bribery in all \r\ntheir forms, strengthening the recovery and return of \r\nstolen assets and developing effective, accountable and \r\ntransparent institutions at all levels.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to reaffirm Botswana’s \r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the full implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our actions \r\nshould be bold and transformative as we build a better \r\nfuture for our nations and succeeding generations. We \r\nshould stand firm behind our mantra of leaving no one \r\nbehind. Let us not be hesitant in demonstrating global \r\nleadership, collective responsibility and collaborative \r\npartnerships involving all countries and peoples of the \r\nworld. The future is truly in our hands.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Botswana for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi, President \r\nof the Republic of Botswana, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nCyprus.\r\nMr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Nicos Anastasiades, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Anastasiades: At the outset, allow me to \r\ncongratulate the newly elected President of the General \r\nAssembly, Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, and \r\nto assure her of my Government’s unwavering support \r\nin her mission to lead the Assembly at its seventy-third \r\nsession.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to the memory of the \r\nlate former Secretary-General of the United Nations, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who, with his charismatic and \r\nmeasured approach, redefined the Organization and \r\nactively championed the ideals that characterized his \r\nethos: peacemaking and peacekeeping, international \r\ncooperation and sustainable development.\r\nIn addition, by honouring the centenary of the \r\nbirth of the great statesman and world leader, Nelson \r\nMandela, we have expressed our great admiration and \r\ngratitude for his active promotion of the noble values of \r\npeace, justice and equality.\r\nCyprus fully endorses the theme chosen for this \r\nyear’s session of the General Assembly, “Making the \r\nUnited Nations relevant to all people: global leadership \r\nand shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies”. We fully subscribe to the theme, \r\nin line, of course, with the vast majority of States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, since the essence of \r\nthe theme reminds us of the founding principles of the \r\nOrganization, in which millions of people and many \r\ncountries have vested their hopes for a better future. \r\nThe Organization emerged from the ashes of war for \r\nthe purposes of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity and respecting and promoting human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms for all, irrespective of \r\ngender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief.\r\nThe order it proposes is based on multilateralism, \r\ncollective action and international cooperation among \r\nStates with sovereign equality. However, one might \r\nconsider thinking that we have failed to uphold those \r\nvalues by asking how it is that we come back again and \r\nagain, year after year, as a kind of ritual, to attest to the \r\ndismal lack of effectiveness for some and the attempts at \r\nembellishment of others for what is in fact our inability \r\nto fulfil the aims of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nWhy do the decisions of the Security Council in their \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n6/59 18-30067\r\noverwhelming majority remain mere certificates that \r\nattest to violations? Why are international law and \r\ninternational agreements not implemented? Why do \r\nstrategies and programmes aimed at creating better \r\nconditions for people who are suffering remain wishful \r\nthinking? When will we finally really take our destiny \r\ninto our own hands, fully assuming our responsibilities \r\ntowards our peoples and towards humankind as a \r\nwhole?\r\nAs a leader of a small country that has suffered \r\nfor more than 44 years from blatant violations of \r\ninternational law, let me repeat the well-known causes \r\nthat explain those unacceptable and disappointing \r\nresults, registered at both the regional and global \r\nlevels. I will dare to mention sad realities candidly \r\nand honestly, in the hope that States and international \r\norganizations reconsider or make adjustments to their \r\npolicies and actions with a view to upholding real hope \r\nfor a better future.\r\nIn that effort and struggle we must ensure the \r\ncooperation of all, but more so of the States and the \r\npeoples who are the victims, those suffering from \r\nproblems such as the primacy of a State’s expansionist \r\ninterests over the territorial integrity, peace and \r\nprosperity of other countries and peoples; investing in \r\nand promoting military industries and infrastructure \r\nby fomenting conflict for financial gain; standing by \r\npassively in the face of such violations of international \r\nlaw as the annexation of territories that fuels separatism \r\nand civil wars, so as not to poison relations and \r\ncommon interests among friendly countries; and some \r\nStates’ financing and promotion of terrorism in order to \r\nimpose religious fundamentalism.\r\nWhile more than 20 million people in north-eastern \r\nNigeria, South Sudan, Yemen and Somalia face famine \r\nand are in need of urgent assistance, and while more \r\nthan 820 million people, including 155 million children, \r\nsuffer from chronic malnutrition, there are countries in \r\nwhich immense quantities of animal and plant products \r\nare destroyed for the sake of narrow and blind economic \r\nand commercial considerations. While child mortality \r\nand life-threatening diseases persist and the quality of \r\nhealth services is below acceptable levels, we continue \r\nto face inflexible policies and practices that emasculate \r\nthe relevant authorities and prevent them from providing \r\nnecessary medical care. Instead of tackling the root \r\ncauses leading to the massive migratory f lows of \r\nmillions of people, we content ourselves with setting up \r\nimmigration detention centres. While we have adopted \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change to address \r\nthat global challenge, specific interests hinder both the \r\ndesign and the implementation of domestic policies that \r\ncould deliver on our pledge and commitments.\r\nAll of the those factors, in addition to an inability \r\nto effectively implement United Nations resolutions, \r\nhave led to unprecedented crises and resulted in \r\na lack of credibility, trust and even legitimacy in \r\nour decision-making, bringing about the forcible \r\ndisplacement of millions of people, hunger and distress \r\nthat intensify migration f lows, create demographic \r\nchanges and exert huge economic and social pressures \r\non all countries or regions affected, human and drug \r\ntrafficking, leading to millions of deaths, and the \r\ndestruction of cultural heritage.\r\nDespite diverging aspirations and conflicting \r\ninterests, we should rise to meet our shared \r\nresponsibilities, reverse the policies of political \r\nexpediency that I have already mentioned, adopt \r\na more proactive, targeted and results-oriented \r\napproach and address the root causes that have led \r\nto this unprecedented situation. We should intensify \r\nour efforts to make sustainable development a reality \r\nfor all countries and regions in need, once and for \r\nall, by establishing the political and socioeconomic \r\nconditions necessary for stability, economic growth \r\nand institution-building. At the same time, we should \r\nalso work to confront the threats posed by ongoing \r\nconflicts efficiently, in order to achieve lasting and \r\nviable political solutions that promote regional peace, \r\nsecurity and predictability and spare future generations \r\nfrom the plague of asymmetrical threats.\r\nCollective leadership, together with the primacy of \r\nmultilateralism, is the only way to effectively eliminate \r\nthreats to peace and security. We therefore need to \r\nstrengthen our support and commitment to the United \r\nNations and safeguard the effective implementation \r\nof its decisions and actions, based on justice and \r\ninternational law, which constitute the core and essence \r\nof the Organization.\r\nIn that context, we firmly support the ambitious \r\nvision of Secretary-General António Guterres \r\nfor reforming the Organization in a manner that \r\ncorresponds to the needs of its Member States and \r\nmeets the expectations of our peoples. With regard \r\nto reforming the development pillar, we reiterate our \r\nfull commitment to strengthening the capacity of the \r\nUnited Nations so that it can become more effective \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 7/59\r\nand transparent in its efforts to implement the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, which represents \r\nan integral part of our efforts to help all people to live \r\nin dignity. In parallel, we must take further action \r\nto address States’ vulnerability to climate change, \r\nparticularly small island States, just as we need to \r\nput more emphasis on implementing the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and accelerate efforts to that end.\r\nBearing in mind the ongoing unstable situations \r\nand conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Nigeria, \r\nMyanmar, Afghanistan, the Sahel, the long-standing \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict and, of course, the still \r\nunresolved problem of the forcible division of my \r\ncountry, reforming the peace and security pillar is \r\nparticularly important. We fully concur with the notion \r\nof the primacy of diplomacy in peacemaking and \r\nconflict resolution and the supportive yet catalytic role \r\nof peacekeeping operations. However, we must admit \r\nthat the former is in jeopardy without the latter, and \r\nthat in the absence of a negotiating process, the need \r\nfor peacekeeping becomes much greater and, in many \r\ncases, indispensable. The situation in my country is \r\na meaningful example of that. Accordingly, while we \r\nremain deeply committed to adopting the necessary \r\nreforms related to this pillar, we strongly believe that \r\neach peacekeeping operation should be evaluated on its \r\nown merits, based on actual needs and threats on the \r\nground. The risks involved are far too grave to allow for \r\nany experimentation in that regard.\r\nNotwithstanding Cyprus’s membership in the \r\nEuropean Union (EU), it is located at the epicentre of an \r\narea of extreme volatility and instability. Our quest is \r\nbased on our vision and ambition of becoming a beacon \r\nof stability, predictability and synergy for the purposes \r\nof promoting shared prosperity and stability for all. \r\nTo that end, and as a unanimously accepted honest \r\nbroker with no hidden agenda, we have reinforced \r\nour historically close ties with the countries in our \r\nimmediate neighbourhood, and, together with Greece, \r\nwe have established trilateral partnerships with several \r\nof our neighbours, including Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, \r\nJordan and Palestine. Those trilateral mechanisms \r\nconstitute a fitting example of what can be achieved \r\nwhen countries with shared concerns and common \r\ninterests join forces rather than isolating themselves. \r\nIn short, they are a practical expression of effective \r\nmultilateralism, fully in line with this year’s theme \r\nof shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies. Accordingly, I want to emphasize \r\nthe partnerships are neither exclusionary nor directed \r\nagainst any third country. On the contrary, they \r\ninstitutionalize cooperation and dialogue in our region, \r\nparticularly in areas in which there are comparative \r\nadvantages, such as energy. In that regard, we warmly \r\nwelcome the expansion of those trilateral formats to \r\ninclude additional partners in other specific fields for \r\nmutually beneficial collaboration.\r\nWhen talking about the importance of achieving \r\npeace and stability in our immediate neighbourhood \r\nand the means by which that can be accomplished, \r\nI feel obliged to stress the significance and \r\nconsequent multiple benefits that would result from a \r\ncomprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem. First \r\nand foremost, a viable and lasting settlement would \r\nbe in the best interests of the people of Cyprus, both \r\nGreek and Turkish Cypriots, as it would fulfil their \r\naspiration to live in a normal and prosperous European \r\ncountry, fully independent and free from any foreign \r\ndependency. At the same time, I remain convinced that \r\nresolving the Cyprus problem will undoubtedly have a \r\nvery important collateral influence on achieving and \r\nmaintaining a much-needed environment of stability \r\nand peace in the region. Last but not least, a resolution \r\nof this international problem, which has been on the \r\nagenda of the United Nations for decades, will offer \r\na beacon of hope and demonstrate that even the most \r\nintractable problems can be solved peacefully through \r\nthe Organization. Unfortunately, as the peace process \r\nhas remained at an impasse since the conference on \r\nCyprus in July 2017, I am deeply concerned about the \r\ntime that has elapsed and its consequences.\r\nTo state it clearly, only a viable and functional \r\nsolution to the Cyprus problem, in line with the \r\nprinciples of our EU membership and the best practices \r\nof the democratic countries of the United Nations, \r\ncan establish the conditions for achieving lasting \r\npeace, enabling my country to fully hit its stride and \r\nall Cypriots to live in a state of normalcy and work \r\ntogether for their prosperity and security. As I have said \r\npreviously, I remain strongly and truly committed to \r\nachieving a solution on the basis of the relevant United \r\nNations resolutions and the European Union acquis, and \r\ncontinuing the negotiations on the six-point framework \r\nthat the Secretary-General has set as the basis for the \r\nway forward. The Secretary-General’s framework \r\nand good-offices mission constitute the only path to \r\na solution.\r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n8/59 18-30067\r\nWe expect that Turkey, which has a key role to \r\nplay in efforts to reach a settlement, will rise to the \r\noccasion, demonstrate the political will necessary for \r\nreaching a settlement and concretely contribute to \r\nregional stability. For our part, I want to repeat once \r\nagain that we are determined to rise to the challenge of \r\nour historic responsibility and do our utmost to provide \r\na peaceful future for all Cypriots and the region as \r\na whole.\r\nIn a fragmented and multipolar world, we have \r\nmore than ever a moral, ethical and political duty to \r\npromote the essence of human civilization, unite our \r\nstrength to maintain international peace and security \r\nand establish conditions that can bring prosperity and \r\nwelfare to all. That perfectly matches the theme of this \r\nyear’s session, and I hope that by next year we will be \r\nin a position to be proud of ourselves because we have \r\ntaken significant steps towards fulfilling that vision.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Gjorge Ivanov, President of the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia.\r\nMr. Gjorge Ivanov, President of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Gjorge Ivanov, President \r\nof the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ivanov (spoke in Macedonian; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): This year \r\nwe celebrate the centenary of the end of the First \r\nWorld War. The League of Nations was supposed to \r\nsafeguard peace, but it failed. The United Nations rose \r\nfrom the ashes of the Second World War to address \r\na world that had been destroyed by fascism, Nazism, \r\nracism and colonialism. By adopting the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, a brave generation of leaders gave \r\nhope to the unprivileged, the oppressed and the denied \r\nthat they would be able to exercise their right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nSeventy years ago, the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights represented another glimmer of hope \r\nfor humankind, and thanks to the work of the United \r\nNations and its numerous programmes, that hope \r\nbecame realistic. Through peacekeeping missions, \r\narms control, non-proliferation treaties and the fight \r\nagainst terrorism and international organized crime, we \r\nbuilt a safer world. The Sustainable Development Goals \r\nhave helped us to focus our energy on reducing poverty, \r\neradicating illness, enabling access to education, clean \r\nwater and sanitation and creating opportunities for \r\nyoung people. With the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange we are fighting climate change and trying to \r\nbuild communities and nations that are resilient where \r\nthreats of disaster are concerned. As a result, millions \r\nof people today are living better lives than they did \r\na decade ago. All of those achievements would be \r\nunimaginable had we not united our efforts through the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAs President of the Republic of Macedonia, I can \r\nrightly say that the Macedonian people participated in \r\nthe creation of the post-Second World War order. We \r\nwere on the right side of history, because, even back \r\nin 1941, we had started to fight the evils of fascism \r\nand Nazism. The Macedonian State participated \r\nin the creation of the United Nations. In 1945, the \r\nFederal People’s Republic of Yugoslavia was one of \r\nthe founders of the Organization. As a constitutive \r\nRepublic with a right to self-determination and \r\nsecession, Macedonia was therefore a de facto founder \r\nof the United Nations. As a State within the Federal \r\nPeople’s Republic of Yugoslavia, we participated in the \r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nand international pacts on civil and political, economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights that guarantee human dignity, \r\nthe right to self-determination as well as the right of \r\nStates to sovereign equality. On 8 September 1991, \r\nexercising our sovereign right to self-determination and \r\nsecession, we peacefully left the collapsing Socialist \r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia and proclaimed an \r\nindependent and sovereign Republic of Macedonia.\r\nIn all of that, a great injustice has been done, and \r\nthis is what it is all about. To date, we have not been \r\nallowed to fully enjoy the privileges of membership \r\nin the Organization or of the documents in whose \r\ncreation we once participated. We have been denied the \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 9/59\r\nsovereign right to call ourselves by our name, as if a \r\nmere administrative region in Greece of the same name \r\ncould have greater rights in international relations than \r\na sovereign State such as the Republic of Macedonia.\r\nTwenty-five years ago, on 8 April 1993, the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia became a State Member of \r\nthe United Nations. And yet in this community of \r\nequals before the law, the Republic of Macedonia was \r\nadmitted as less equal, with a derogated legal status and \r\na violated right to self-determination. Today, 25 years \r\nlater, the talks within the United Nations on this matter \r\nmay end with the adoption of the so-called Prespa \r\nfinal agreement, which, according to some, should put \r\nan end to the name dispute with Greece and open the \r\nway to membership for the Republic of Macedonia in \r\nthe European Union (EU) and NATO. The settlement \r\nbegins with a grand preamble that would make even the \r\nauthors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nenvious. Ironically, the Prespa agreement violates the \r\nsame universal principles and standards that it refers to \r\nin its preamble, including the right to human dignity.\r\nWith regard to the rights that have been violated, I \r\nwant to draw the General Assembly’s attention to one, \r\nthe right to self-determination. Its meaning is that only \r\na nation itself has the right to determine its destiny, and \r\nthat no one has the right to forcibly interfere in the life \r\nof the nation, destroy its schools and other institutions, \r\nviolate its traditions and customs, repress its language \r\nor curtail its rights. The right to self-determination \r\nmeans that a nation may organize its life in the way it \r\nwishes, specifically on the basis of autonomy. It has the \r\nright to complete secession. Nations are sovereign and \r\nall nations have equal rights.\r\nThe right to self-determination is what empowers \r\na people to choose their own name and the name of the \r\nState that they create. The right to choose a name is \r\nan inalienable part of the right to self-determination. \r\nOnly by respecting the right to self-determination \r\ncan the United Nations be relevant for all people. As \r\na people, we have borne the name “Macedonians” for \r\ncenturies and, as a State for 74 years, before the United \r\nNations even existed. Our attachment to that name was \r\nconfirmed 27 years ago, when we exercised our right to \r\nself-determination and proclaimed an independent and \r\nsovereign Republic of Macedonia.\r\nStill, through the Prespa agreement, Greece is \r\nimposing a new name on us and is asking for an erga \r\nomnes implementation for both international and \r\ndomestic use. It assumes that we will change our \r\nConstitution, meaning that Greece would become \r\nan ultimate authority whose approval is required for \r\nother States’ constitutional amendments. Through this \r\nsettlement Greece would be permitted to permanently \r\nmonitor not only what we call ourselves but also how \r\nall States Members of the United Nations address us. It \r\nwould be authorized to rename our institutions, censor \r\nthe content of our children’s schoolbooks and prevent \r\ncitizens from expressing their Macedonian identity, \r\nincluding by regulating what we call our Macedonian \r\nlanguage. A very important part of our way of life would \r\ntherefore depend on Greek will. That would represent \r\ncensorship of the world and require the Macedonian \r\npeople to censor themselves. It does violence to our \r\ncollective historical memory.\r\nThere are hundreds of thousands of pages of \r\ndocuments and testimonies in the United Nations \r\narchives detailing what the Greek State used to do \r\nto Macedonians in Greece. Now, through the Prespa \r\nagreement, the Greek State is trying to do the exact same \r\nthings to Macedonians in the Republic of Macedonia. \r\nIts aim is to limit the use of the name “Macedonians” to \r\nthe smallest possible space, that is, the space between \r\nour ears, while requiring us to keep our mouths shut. It \r\nis a f lagrant violation of the right to self-determination.\r\nThe Prespa agreement is the bitter fruit of a tree \r\nthat was poisoned long ago. It is a reflection of a hurtful \r\ncompromise f lowing from the 1995 Interim Accord. \r\nAt a time when we were internationally isolated, the \r\nInterim Accord, achieved under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations, was supposed to guarantee that Greece \r\nwould not block our integration into international \r\norganizations. However, it was seriously f lawed. \r\nNo one can transfer more rights to another than they \r\nactually possess. And yet under article 5 of the 1995 \r\nInterim Accord and the United Nations-led process, \r\nGreece was allowed to negotiate with the Republic of \r\nMacedonia on its name, in a violation of the right to \r\nself-determination.\r\nThe Interim Accord itself was not created out of \r\nthin air, as it originated in Security Council resolutions \r\n817 (1993) and 845 (1993). Although the Security \r\nCouncil noted that the Republic of Macedonia fulfilled \r\nthe criteria for United Nations membership set out in \r\nArticle 4 of the Charter, it nevertheless concluded that \r\nthere was a dispute over the name of the State, making \r\nthe Republic of Macedonia’s membership subject to \r\nthe condition of accepting the provisional name of “the \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n10/59 18-30067\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” and imposing \r\nthe obligation to discuss the naming issue. That \r\nformulation is nothing but a euphemism for violating \r\nthe right to self-determination, which is how we arrived \r\nat the root of the problem.\r\nThe right to self-determination was violated \r\nwhen the Republic of Macedonia was admitted to the \r\nUnited Nations. The Interim Accord and the Prespa \r\nagreement were adopted to justify that violation. The \r\nAssembly should know that the text of the so-called \r\nPrespa agreement was prepared without my knowledge \r\nor consent as President of the Republic of Macedonia. \r\nMoreover, the agreement violates a clause in our \r\ndomestic law that is of fundamental importance. In \r\nother words, the knot that began to form with resolutions \r\n817 (1993) and 845 (1993) and the Interim Accord has \r\nnow, with the Prespa agreement, taken the shape of a \r\nhangman’s noose. The Republic of Macedonia is now \r\nbeing asked to commit legal and historical suicide so \r\nthat the legal abolition of the Macedonian people can \r\nthen be interpreted as the country’s own wilful decision. \r\nWhat does that say about global leadership and shared \r\nresponsibility in the context of the United Nations?\r\nGreece insists on an erga omnes implementation of \r\nthe imposed name, which also makes the violation of \r\nthe right to self-determination erga omnes. However, \r\nthe International Court of Justice stated in its judgment \r\nin East Timor (Portugal v. Australia) of 30 June 1995 \r\nthat the right to self-determination does indeed have \r\nan erga omnes effect. However, that very important \r\ndecision was overlooked in the preparation of the \r\nInterim Accord three months later.\r\nIt has been said that the Macedonian case is unique \r\nin the United Nations. However, the United Nations \r\narchives contain an almost identical case in which a \r\nMember State argues for denying an applicant country’s \r\nright to membership because of its name. I say “almost \r\nidentical” because the United Nations ignored the \r\nMember State’s request to block the other country’s \r\nentry. And all of that happened after the precedent \r\nwe set. I ask the Assembly why the United Nations is \r\nunable to do the same in the case of the Republic of \r\nMacedonia. Are all States not equally sovereign? Is the \r\nUnited Nations more relevant for some peoples and less \r\nrelevant for others?\r\nWe are once again seeing an unprincipled Athens \r\nvictorious over a peace-loving Melos, showing that the \r\nstronger do what they can and the weaker do what they \r\nmust. The Prespa agreement puts us in a situation of \r\nfait accompli, in which we are told that we are smaller \r\nand weaker and must therefore accept the ultimatum of \r\nAthens. Instead of being rewarded for our peace-loving \r\nnature, we have been punished for it. It seems to have \r\nbeen forgotten that the United Nations was created by \r\nvisionaries who wanted an order in which even the \r\nsmallest and weakest of peoples would be protected, \r\nbecause respecting the rights of small peoples and \r\nStates is a barometer of the observance of the Charter \r\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nAristotle claimed that whoever is not part of the \r\npolis is either a beast or a god. What the individual used \r\nto be to the ancient cities is, in a way, what the State is \r\nto the international community today. Greece is acting \r\nas if it is not bound by the rules of the international \r\norder. With such an attitude, I wonder in which category \r\nAristotle would classify the cradle of democracy in \r\n2018. If the United Nations is incapable of giving force \r\nto a just law, then it only legitimizes improper force. \r\nAn international order cannot be preserved by violating \r\ninternational law.\r\nFor a long time, we were persuaded that there \r\nwas no other way. But through its fruit we recognized \r\nthe tree. Through the Prespa agreement we have seen \r\nthat we were misled into searching for a solution that \r\nwould mean eroding the right to self-determination. \r\nHow should we undo this complicated knot, this noose \r\naround our neck? The unravelling should begin where \r\neverything else began, with the violation of the right to \r\nself-determination.\r\nThe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties \r\nstates very clearly that every agreement contrary to jus \r\ncogens standard is null and void. According to Article \r\n1, paragraph 2, and Article 55 of the United Nations \r\nCharter, one of the rights that falls under the jus cogens \r\nstandard is the right to self-determination. Article 5 of \r\nthe 1995 Interim Accord specifies negotiations on the \r\nright to self-determination, which makes it contrary to \r\nthe jus cogens standard, which means that the entire \r\n1995 Interim Accord is null and void, as is the Prespa \r\nagreement that f lows from it.\r\nMr. Tiare (Burkina Faso), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nNo one has the right to call into question the \r\ndecision of a people to choose their names or the name \r\nof the country they create, which is a decision derived \r\nfrom the right to self-determination, which has been \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 11/59\r\nestablished as an absolute right of all peoples. Only the \r\nright to self-determination, and not its violation, can \r\nhave an erga omnes effect.\r\nAs I am speaking in this Hall, in my country, the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, my fellow citizens are counting \r\ndown the last hours to the holding of a referendum on \r\nthe Prespa agreement, on which they have been asked \r\nto express themselves. In the past few weeks, many \r\nhigh-profile foreign representatives have visited the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia. I know that many of them \r\nsincerely wish to help the Republic of Macedonia \r\nbecome part of the European Union and NATO, and I \r\nthank them for their good intentions from the bottom of \r\nmy heart. However, I am afraid that they too have been \r\nmisled. Their message is that if the referendum fails \r\nand the Prespa agreement is not accepted, we cannot \r\nhope for membership in NATO or the European Union. \r\nI say to them that if they take away our hope, what will \r\nwe be left with? They must help us by unblocking the \r\nway for the Republic of Macedonia to accede to EU and \r\nNATO membership without violating the right to self-\r\ndetermination in the process.\r\nMany of those representatives have been trying \r\nto persuade Macedonian citizens to accept the Greek \r\nproposal. I would like to ask them if they would \r\naccept a derogation of the right to self-determination \r\nof their own peoples and countries. Would they accept \r\ninterference in their internal affairs, or any other breach \r\nof their sovereignty and political independence? Why \r\nthen are we being asked to accept something that no \r\none else in the world would? They must stop trying to \r\npersuade us to eat this poisoned fruit. It is high time for \r\nthe poisoned tree to be uprooted and its fruit discarded.\r\nIn the last few hours before the silence of the \r\nreferendum, I therefore want to convey a message to my \r\nfellow citizens in the Republic of Macedonia. Voting on \r\na referendum is their right, and it is not an obligation. In \r\naccordance with article 7, item 3 of our referendum law, \r\nno one shall be held responsible for voting or not voting \r\nin a referendum. Every citizen has the right to decide \r\nhow to act with regard to the referendum, whether by \r\ngoing out and voting or staying at home and boycotting.\r\nJust as the referendum on 8 September 1991 led \r\nto sovereignty and independence, the referendum on \r\n30 September may lead to a state of subordination \r\nto another country and dependence on it,. If the \r\nreferendum succeeds, then in accordance with the law \r\nnot only will the country’s existing name be changed, \r\na new, semi-sovereign country will be created, with a \r\nnew name and a new internal and international legal \r\nidentity. We will be a State only in name and not in \r\nsubstance, because others will have succeeded in \r\nregulating our way of life.\r\nHowever, if the referendum fails, a new possibility \r\narises for discussing and exploring new options for \r\nresolving the issue, in accordance with international \r\nlaw and with respect for our fundamental right to \r\nself-determination. There will be an opportunity to \r\nrenew the national consensus that we achieved at \r\nthe beginning of our independence. It does not take \r\ncourage to capitulate. It takes courage to persist in the \r\nrealization of a country’s right to self-determination \r\nand to preserving its sovereignty and independence. It \r\ntakes courage to tell the truth.\r\nThis 30 September will be decisive for our future. \r\nAnd at the same time, for centuries, 30 September has \r\ntraditionally been the day when we celebrate the faith, \r\nhope and love that arise from wisdom. I ask citizens \r\nnot to lose faith in themselves, because the future of \r\nthe Republic of Macedonia depends on them. They \r\nmust not lose their hope and patriotic love for the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, because only as a sovereign \r\nand independent country can it be a guardian of their \r\nfreedom and human dignity. As a citizen, I have made \r\nmy decision. On 30 September, I will not go out to \r\nvote. I believe that my fellow citizens will make a \r\nwise decision.\r\nI also want to address the representatives of States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. This irrational dispute \r\nhas had detrimental consequences for the Republic \r\nof Macedonia and its citizens. Thanks to Greek \r\nblockades, we have been denied our right to prosperity. \r\nUnfortunately, all of that has had an impact on the \r\nsustainability of a multi-ethnic, multireligious and \r\nmultilingual Macedonian society, a society that has \r\nactively contributed to peace, stability and security in \r\nthe region and in Europe for the past 27 years.\r\nThe position of the authorities in Athens is \r\ncontrary not only to international law and the decisions \r\nof Macedonian citizens, but also to the will of the \r\nalmost 140 Member States of the United Nations \r\nthat have recognized the Republic of Macedonia’s \r\nfundamental right to self-determination of and to use \r\nits constitutional name. As President of the Republic \r\nof Macedonia, I urge all States that have already \r\nrecognized the Republic of Macedonia and established \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n12/59 18-30067\r\ndiplomatic relations under its constitutional name not \r\nto change their decision. They must demonstrate their \r\nsovereignty by remaining faithful to the principled \r\ndecisions they have made, without any kind of pressure. \r\nThey must help us by being the guardians of our right \r\nto self-determination, thereby safeguarding their own \r\nright to self-determination.\r\nModern history has shown that the Balkans is a \r\nbirthplace of precedents. If we are subject to damaging \r\nprecedents that limit our sovereignty and political \r\nindependence, it is only a matter of time before such \r\nprecedents are applied in other States. What does that \r\nsay about the relevance of the United Nations for all \r\npeople, about leadership and shared responsibility?\r\nI have always advocated and actively contributed to \r\nthe building of a true and lasting partnership between \r\nthe Republic of Macedonia and Greece, as well as \r\nfriendship and trust between the Macedonian and Greek \r\nsocieties. However, if the only way to accommodate \r\nthe irrational demands of the Greek side is through \r\nmeasures imposed on the Macedonian side, what we \r\nget are relations without trust. The agreement does not \r\nbring Macedonians and Greeks together but rather sets \r\nthem apart.\r\nThe Greek and Macedonian societies should learn \r\nhow to live together despite their deep differences. To \r\nreach a real, sustainable and lasting agreement, we \r\nneed dialogue rather than monologue, arguments rather \r\nthan ideas imposed by force and mutual respect rather \r\nthan denial. Only by supporting that just approach \r\nwill the United Nations be relevant in our case and \r\ndemonstrate leadership and shared responsibility. The \r\nUnited Nations can be relevant only if it respects its \r\nown principles.\r\nIt is possible that even as I speak statements are \r\nbeing written condemning my speech. Most often the \r\nfirst reaction to truth is hatred. Truth uncovers lies, \r\nunfulfilled promises and guilty consciences. And there \r\nare a lot of guilty consciences involved in the case of \r\nMacedonia. However, truth also liberates and enables \r\nus to accept guilt, to correct mistakes and heal the \r\nwounds from the violation of our fundamental right \r\nto self-determination and human dignity. The simple \r\ntruth is that we are Macedonians and our country is \r\nthe Republic of Macedonia. By respecting this simple \r\ntruth of our identity, members of this organ respect our \r\nhuman dignity, which is enshrined in the foundations of \r\nfreedom, justice and peace in the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Gjorge Ivanov, President of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Teodoro \r\nObiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of the Republic \r\nof Equatorial Guinea, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke in \r\nSpanish): On the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea’s independence, on \r\n12 October, I would like to extend a greeting of peace and \r\nfreedom to all the nations of the world as an expression \r\nof the gratitude of the people of Equatorial Guinea for \r\nthe most resounding success of the United Nations \r\nsince its creation in 1945, the liberation of all colonized \r\npeoples. Indeed, the well-being of humankind, a \r\nfundamental objective of the United Nations, could not \r\nbe achieved if the freedom and dignity of peoples and \r\nnations were constrained by the subjugation of some \r\npeoples by others through the colonial system. For that \r\nreason, my delegation would like to to once again raise \r\nits voice in this global setting to call for the end of \r\nstrongholds of colonialism, wherever they may be and \r\nwhatever form they take.\r\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea wholeheartedly \r\ncongratulates Her Excellency Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés on her election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session, as a \r\nreflection of both the gender equality the Organization \r\nseeks to uphold and the political pragmatism of her \r\ncountry, the Republic of Ecuador, in its scrupulous \r\nrespect for the purposes and principles of the United \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 13/59\r\nNations. We believe that under her leadership the \r\nUnited Nations will achieve the successes it desires.\r\nWe also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák, the outgoing President, on his indisputable \r\nsuccesses and outstanding work in leading the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session. By the \r\nsame token, the work of the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. António Guterres, deserves our praise \r\nfor the dynamism with which he has been leading all \r\nthe bodies of the United Nations with a view to making \r\nthem less bureaucratic and bringing their efforts closer \r\nto Member States.\r\nThe topics selected for discussion during this \r\nsession represent the greatest concerns of the \r\ninternational community. Economically speaking, \r\ndespite the numerous resolutions and recommendations \r\nadopted by the United Nations for promoting nations’ \r\nsustainable growth and economic development, an \r\ninsurmountable gap between developed and developing \r\ncountries continues making it more difficult to maintain \r\npeace and stability in poor countries. That compels us \r\nto set aside our ambitions and pride and support the \r\nachievement of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the African Union’s \r\nAgenda 2063 with all the means available to us.\r\nA supposedly globalized world in which imbalance, \r\nmarginalization and instability reign would be difficult \r\non every front, political, economic, social and moral. \r\nIn that regard, the current problems of mass and \r\nuncontrolled immigration of populations from South to \r\nNorth, the internal instabilities of developing countries \r\nand rebel and terrorist movements throughout the \r\nworld are clear reactions to the problems of poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment suffered by developing countries as \r\na result of behaviour that shows injustice and a lack \r\nof solidarity. We cannot guarantee international peace \r\nand security while those pockets of violence remain, \r\njeopardizing the lives of populations.\r\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, as a \r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council, \r\nwill always support and give priority to preventive \r\ndiplomacy to avoid conflicts and foster dialogue, \r\nagreements, negotiation and the peaceful resolution of \r\nconflicts. Above all, we ask for scrupulous observance \r\nof the principles of international law, particularly with \r\nregard to respect for the independence and sovereignty \r\nof each State, non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof other nations, every country’s right to use its own \r\nnatural resources and the promotion of fair and equitable \r\ncooperation with reciprocal benefits among States.\r\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea also praises and \r\ncommends the peace processes undertaken — through \r\ndialogue, compromise and tolerance among the \r\nparties — between the Federal Republic of Ethiopia \r\nand Somalia, and between the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, the Republic of Korea and the United \r\nStates of America with respect to the Korean peninsula. \r\nEquatorial Guinea calls for similar resolutions of \r\nother conflicts in the world, such as those in Djibouti, \r\nSomalia, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Syria, Yemen, the \r\nMiddle East, Libya, South Sudan, Central Africa, \r\nBurundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nGuinea-Bissau.\r\nFor Equatorial Guinea, coercive decisions such as \r\nSecurity Council sanctions have never resolved any \r\nconflict in the history of the United Nations. Neither \r\nhave armed interventions resolved substantive issues. \r\nOn the contrary, they are opposed to the principles of \r\nState independence and sovereignty that endow States \r\nwith responsibilities. We therefore insist on the value of \r\nnegotiation as a political and moral tool that is capable \r\nof satisfying the parties to a conflict. Contrary to their \r\nclaims, obligatory condemnations trigger defensive \r\nbehaviour from the State in question, whether out of \r\npride or in self-defence. Worst of all, such decisions \r\nusually result in depriving the affected peoples of their \r\nmost fundamental rights.\r\nAs a matter of international justice, Equatorial \r\nGuinea believes in the need to reform the Security \r\nCouncil to make it more democratic, representative \r\nand capable of guaranteeing the interests that shape \r\nthe current global framework. The Council’s structure, \r\nadopted in 1945, is obsolete, since our world is no \r\nlonger governed by the political criteria of the time. \r\nIn that regard, the African continent is the future of \r\nhumankind today and should not remain marginalized \r\nfrom major decisions that may affect the whole world. \r\nThe Security Council, which is partly to blame for \r\nAfrica’s marginalization, must also feel responsible for \r\nthe recent conflicts in the Sahel region and the ongoing \r\nunbridled immigration from Africa to Europe.\r\nWith regard to my country’s domestic \r\ndevelopment, despite the significant oil crisis affecting \r\nEquatorial Guinea, socioeconomic development is \r\nevolving positively, thanks to the prevailing peace. \r\nWe can therefore expect to see the country recover \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n14/59 18-30067\r\neconomically relatively soon. And our transition \r\nprogramme towards a multiparty system, initiated in \r\n1992, has been characterized by an inclusive democratic \r\nopenness and permanent dialogue open to all. In its \r\nfirst year we recognized 14 political parties, a number \r\nthat has now risen to 18 in a country with fewer than \r\n1.5 million inhabitants.\r\nOver that period we have held six rounds of \r\ninclusive dialogue with opposition political parties, \r\nwhich has resulted not only in the recognition of new \r\npolitical parties, but has also produced reform of \r\nthe Constitution and of other laws regulating public \r\nfreedoms. As a result, Heads of State are now limited to \r\ntwo successive terms, whereas before they could hold \r\noffice indefinitely. Several control bodies for managing \r\npublic affairs have also been created.\r\nThe socioeconomic development plan adopted \r\nfollowing our second national economic conference, \r\nin 2000, envisaged economic recovery by 2020. Its \r\nmost significant results have been the construction of \r\nbasic economic infrastructure such as roads, ports, \r\nairports, environmental sanitation facilities, modern \r\nhospitals, vocational and university training centres, \r\ndrinking water systems, telecommunications and power \r\ninfrastructure and, more recently, the transformation of \r\ndensely populated rural hubs throughout the country \r\ninto small modern cities.\r\nHuman capacity-building has achieved such levels \r\nthat citizens are able to responsibly manage national \r\ndevelopment, which has created an atmosphere \r\nof trust between national political forces and the \r\npeople, who feel empowered to realize their own \r\nobjectives. In its  the effects of the economic crisis, the \r\nGovernment is planning a third phase of the national \r\neconomic conference with a view to purposefully \r\nspearheading the socioeconomic development plan \r\ninitially set for 2020. We call for the cooperation of \r\nfriendly countries and for multilateral assistance to \r\nsupport the Government’s efforts, which are currently \r\ngeared to the diversification of production sources, \r\nindustrialization and the development of the national \r\neconomy’s production sector, as well as capitalizing on \r\nexisting infrastructure.\r\nThe United Nations should serve as a forum for \r\ncooperative exchanges that promote the development \r\nof humankind as well as a forum for dialogue.\r\nFinally, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \r\nbelieves that the United Nations is the highest body of \r\nmultilateral diplomacy within which, if we all adhere \r\nequally to the general principles of international law, \r\nwe can not only guarantee world peace and stability but \r\nalso build more developed societies that guarantee the \r\nrights of all the peoples of the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jovenel Moïse, President of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Haiti.\r\nMr. Jovenel Moïse, President of the Republic of \r\nHaiti, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Jovenel \r\nMoïse, President of the Republic of Haiti, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Moïse (spoke in French): At the outset, \r\nallow me to congratulate President María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés on her election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Her unanimously recognized \r\nqualities and talent will certainly guarantee the \r\nsuccess of the work of the Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session. I would also like to welcome the presence \r\nof the Secretary-General and to acknowledge his \r\ncourageous efforts to improve the effectiveness of the \r\nUnited Nations system, as part of the collective search \r\nfor, in the words of Pope Francis, the “common good \r\nof humanity”.\r\nOver the years, the General Assembly has been \r\nconfronted with two underlying questions related to \r\nthe main topics on its agenda. How can we optimize \r\nour mechanisms for maintaining international peace \r\nand security? And how can we translate the need for \r\ninternational solidarity into a much more effective \r\nsystem of cooperation, capable of promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment and eradicating poverty in the world?\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 15/59\r\nThe United Nations has rightly shed light on the \r\nclose links between the eradication of poverty and \r\nthe promotion of sustainable development, peace \r\nand security. Similarly, the fight against poverty is \r\ninextricably linked to the promotion of human rights. \r\nExtreme poverty is a denial of human dignity and must \r\ntherefore be at the heart of United Nations efforts, \r\nallowing hundreds of millions of men and women to \r\ncherish the hope of one day seeing its eradication.\r\nIntensifying the fight against global warming, \r\nwhich is one of the most serious threats to humankind, \r\nmust also be one of the international community’s \r\nurgent priorities. The 2016 Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange was a milestone in this regard. Every effort \r\nshould also be made to ensure that international \r\nobligations and the commitments that arise from them \r\nare respected. We are well aware that climate-change \r\nadaptation and mitigation regimes and precautionary \r\nmeasures to alleviate damage are extremely costly. One \r\ncomponent of any sustainable development strategy, \r\nthe mitigation of natural hazards, is essential as an \r\ninvestment today in anticipation of events that may \r\noccur tomorrow. However, to date, the funding is \r\nclearly inadequate to a response that matches the scope \r\nof the challenges before us.\r\nMobilizing new resources for climate change is a \r\ntop priority. We should point out that the world’s most \r\nvulnerable countries, especially small island States, \r\nand above all those in the Caribbean, including the \r\nRepublic of Haiti, emit few greenhouse gases, and \r\nyet suffer most of the damage caused by increasingly \r\nfrequent and violent hurricanes. The promises made at \r\nlast year’s One Planet Summit in Paris to enable those \r\ncountries to adapt their environments and mitigate the \r\nravaging effects of climate change must be kept.\r\nI would like to shed some light on the situation in \r\nHaiti one year after the closure of the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), which \r\nwas succeeded by the United Nations Mission for \r\nJustice Support in Haiti. Since assuming the presidency \r\nof the Republic of Haiti, I have worked tirelessly to \r\nconsolidate the rule of law, deepen democratic gains \r\nand promote human rights, as I am firmly convinced \r\nof the absolute necessity of modernizing our economic, \r\nsocial and political structures in order to enable my \r\ncountry to emerge from the trap of underdevelopment. \r\nI have spared no effort to ensure that institutions are \r\nstable and create a safe and stable environment that is \r\nconducive to investment and restarting growth. In the \r\nface of ever scarcer resources and the strong pressure of \r\nthe population’s needs, the Caravan of Change is, in this \r\nrespect, an innovative strategy that aims to put all the \r\nState’s resources at the service of the Haitian people.\r\nThe social, political and economic modernization \r\nprocesses undertaken by the Government have achieved \r\nnumerous tangible results over the past 18 months. In \r\nthis regard, I need only refer to the Secretary-General’s \r\nlatest report on Haiti (S/2018/795), which highlights \r\nthe important progress made in terms of political and \r\ninstitutional stability, the protection of human rights, \r\nstrengthening the judicial system and improving the \r\nsecurity environment. However, despite these advances, \r\nwe must recognize that our sluggish economic growth \r\ncontinues to weigh heavily on the national strategy for \r\ndevelopment and sustaining peace.\r\nThe fact is that we are facing interrelated and \r\nwide-ranging challenges that are compounded by \r\npopulation pressure, major urbanization, environmental \r\ndegradation and extreme vulnerability to natural \r\ndisasters. The 2010 earthquake, the Assembly will \r\nrecall, caused damage equal to 120 per cent of our \r\ngross domestic product (GDP). On top of that, the \r\ndamage from Hurricane Matthew was equivalent to \r\n32 per cent of GDP. This structural and environmental \r\nvulnerability is not without consequences.\r\nIn July, following the enforcement of a law on a fuel \r\nprice adjustment backed by the International Monetary \r\nFund (IMF), we experienced an unfortunate and painful \r\npopular uprising in response to the requirements of the \r\nIMF-backed staff-monitored programme. Haiti, which \r\ndoes not produce oil, is therefore dealing with the \r\ndifficult requirement of having to continue financing \r\nGovernment fuel subsidies.\r\nThe violent expression of discontent from some \r\nparts of the population cannot be underestimated. It \r\nacutely highlighted the key issue of the risks associated \r\nwith extreme socioeconomic insecurity and a lack of \r\neconomic prospects, as well as the fragility of the gains \r\nwe have made so far. However real and indisputable \r\nthose hard-fought gains may be, they may be jeopardized \r\nwithout adequate long-term support.\r\nOne of the lessons that we have learned from the \r\ncrisis is that while structural reforms are essential, \r\nthey are lengthy processes that cannot be accomplished \r\nin a short time or subjected to the often overly rigid \r\nconditions that are imposed by technical and financial \r\npartners without taking into account the socioeconomic \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n16/59 18-30067\r\nrealities of each country. While I do not wish to \r\nassign blame, I should note that the recent uprising \r\nwas in large part the result of an overly narrow vision \r\nof development aid that does not always allow our \r\ninternational partners to recognize the need for a \r\nless fragmented and rigid, more integrated and more \r\ncoherent approach to interrelated development and \r\nsecurity issues that is much more in line with the five \r\nprinciples of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness \r\nand the Accra Agenda for Action.\r\nIn other words, the success of the strategy for \r\nsustaining peace and the gains made, which is vitally \r\nimportant to us, depends largely on our ability to obtain \r\nthe additional resources that will enable us to overcome \r\nour structural handicaps, including boosting public \r\ninvestment in critical infrastructure and overcoming \r\nobstacles to growth that keep nearly three quarters of \r\nthe population below the poverty line.\r\nI would like to reiterate here, before the Assembly, \r\nthe solemn commitment I have made to the Haitian \r\npeople and the international community to spare no \r\neffort in resolutely guiding the country on a path to \r\na sustainable development that is based on the rule \r\nof law, political stability, the tireless, relentless and \r\npersistent struggle against corruption in all its forms, \r\nthe modernization of institutions, socioeconomic \r\nprogress and the consolidation of democratic gains and \r\nachievements in the field of human rights, which, I am \r\nconvinced, are irreversible.\r\nThe newly formed Government of National Unity \r\nhas embarked on that task with a renewed plan of action \r\nand a number of priority objectives and benchmarks. \r\nThey include immediately improving the living \r\nconditions of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable \r\nsegments of the population through innovative \r\nprogrammes; improving the business climate; reviving \r\npublic and private investment for growth and the \r\ncreation of jobs, in order to foster the expansion of the \r\nmiddle class and significantly reduce social inequality \r\nand exclusion in all its forms; pursuing further reforms \r\naimed at consolidating the rule of law, strengthening the \r\njustice system and the national police force, alongside \r\nthe ongoing remobilization of the Haitian armed forces; \r\nfighting corruption in all its forms and manifestations; \r\nholding legislative elections in October 2019, as \r\nplanned; and intensifying measures to strengthen the \r\npromotion and defence of human rights.\r\nAt this crossroads, I urge our partners in the \r\ninternational community to continue to offer the \r\nHaitian people active solidarity, within the framework \r\nof a renewed, coherent and substantial assistance \r\nprogramme, which will be aligned with national \r\npriorities and implemented in close collaboration \r\nwith national institutions and the private business \r\nsector, and thereby better adapted to the realities on \r\nthe ground. This paradigm shift will significantly \r\nstrengthen national efforts and contribute to achieving \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals that we have set \r\nfor ourselves as a first step and to eradicating poverty \r\nby 2030.\r\nWe cannot repeat it often enough — peace, \r\ndevelopment and security go hand in hand . They must \r\nbe adequately supported by appropriate long-term \r\ninvestment. In particular, they require an allocation \r\nof resources better adapted to the real needs of \r\nrecipient countries, taking into account their structural \r\nvulnerabilities. This resource allocation must be \r\nmore f lexible and less subject to conditions that could \r\nultimately undermine the very viability of reforms and \r\nkey development goals, including long-term stability. \r\nAccess to good electrical, digital, school, health, \r\nenvironmental, hydraulic and road infrastructure is \r\na prerequisite for any country that aims to achieve \r\nsustainable development. The Republic of Haiti received \r\nnearly $11 billion in donations and loans between 2006 \r\nand 2016, and yet some of that infrastructure is still not \r\nin place.\r\nHow can we talk about sustainable development \r\nwhen there is no drinking water in families’ taps? How \r\ncan we speak of sustainable development when there \r\nis no water for the irrigation of agricultural land? How \r\ncan we speak of sustainable development when there \r\nare no good roads linking cities and villages? How can \r\nwe speak of sustainable development when there is no \r\nelectrical or digital infrastructure? How can we speak \r\nof sustainable development when there is no adequate \r\nschool or sanitary infrastructure? It is those questions \r\nthat we ask ourselves, the answers to which we are \r\ntirelessly striving to find for the Haitian people.\r\nIn order to build a suitable electrical and digital \r\ntransmission and distribution network over Haiti’s \r\n27,750 square kilometres, we need approximately \r\n$400 million. The Republic of Haiti has nearly 1 million \r\nhectares of agricultural land, half of which can be \r\neasily irrigated. Unfortunately, only 5 per cent of that \r\nland is irrigated, meaning that we need $675 million to \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 17/59\r\nmake an additional 450,000 hectares viable. We need \r\nonly 220 million cubic metres of water each year to \r\nmake household tap water available across Haiti. Yet \r\n40 billion cubic metres of surface water are dumped \r\ninto the sea every year. Approximately $300 million \r\nwould enable us to treat the 220 million cubic metres \r\nneeded to serve all of Haiti’s communes.\r\nWe need to produce 50 million fruit and forest tree \r\nseedlings each year to be able to reforest the country. \r\nThe construction of 14 germplasm and plant propagation \r\ncentres, which would be able to produce 63 million \r\nseedlings a year, costs approximately $35 million. With \r\nregard to education, we need 15,000 classrooms to \r\nenable the 500,000 children who are not yet in school \r\nto have access to a good basic education. We need \r\napproximately $450 million to build those classrooms. \r\nMoreover, we need 122 health-care centres to fill the \r\ndeficit across communes, which will cost $20 million. I \r\nalso take this opportunity to challenge the international \r\ncommunity on the obligation to mobilize resources to \r\neliminate cholera, which was introduced by MINUSTAH \r\nin Haiti, and to compensate the victims. In addition, \r\nin order to connect and renovate the 146 communes of \r\nHaiti and improve certain sections of roads, we need \r\n$800 million. From this rostrum, I would like to say to \r\nour technical and financial partners that together we \r\nmust muster the courage to rethink development aid for \r\nHaiti and other countries in similar situations, using the \r\n2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the \r\n2008 Accra Agenda for Action as our guides.\r\nWith the Republic of Haiti’s meagre financial \r\nresources, we have begun to rebuild the country. Today \r\nmore than ever, we need that synergy to build the \r\nfuture of our country. We must work together, while \r\nscrupulously respecting Haiti’s priorities. The fight \r\nagainst corruption that began on 7 February 2017 cannot \r\nremain wishful thinking. It is a battle that will allow us \r\nto bequeath to future generations a better country in \r\nwhich life is worth living.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Jovenel Moïse, President of the Republic of \r\nHaiti, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Sebastián Piñera Echenique, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Chile\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Chile.\r\nMr. Sebastián Piñera Echenique, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Sebastián \r\nPiñera Echenique, President of the Republic of Chile, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Piñera Echenique (spoke in Spanish): \r\nTwenty years ago, in this very Hall, Kofi Annan set \r\nout the three great challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity at the time: first, the challenge of security \r\nand the need to replace the post-Cold War world order \r\nwith a new one, governed by peace and freedom; \r\nsecondly, the challenge of development and the need \r\nto ensure that globalization benefited all peoples and \r\ncountries, leaving no one behind; thirdly, the challenge \r\nof human rights and the rule of law, and the need to \r\nprotect the dignity of all without distinction as to race, \r\ncolour, gender, language or any other discriminatory \r\nfactor (see A/53/PV.7).\r\nTwenty years have now gone by, and the challenges \r\nbequeathed to us by Kofi Annan — security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights — remain just as \r\nimportant and are still key challenges to our world \r\norder. These challenges, of course, come under new \r\nguises and take on various forms. We are no longer \r\ndivided by the mistrust, fear and prejudice that were \r\nthe legacy of the walls and iron curtains that emerged \r\nin the wake of the Second World War. The truth is that \r\nmany factors unite us in terms of human dignity and \r\nfreedoms, and we are connected by a knowledge- and \r\ninformation-based society that has enabled those who \r\nembrace it to reap the benefits but is indifferent and \r\ncruel to those who turn their back to it. We are living at \r\na time of vast global transformation, which means the \r\nemergence of tremendous new opportunities as well as \r\nmajor new dangers.\r\nSome believed that the end of the Cold War also \r\nmeant the end of history, and that we had at last found \r\nour way and were approaching an era of peace, freedom \r\nand prosperity, based on democracy and the social \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n18/59 18-30067\r\nmarket economy. However, history will never meet its \r\nend as long as there are still free men and women who \r\nthink for themselves. Accordingly, a new world order \r\nhas emerged that has given rise to new divisions and \r\ntensions in many parts of the world. States are no longer \r\nthe only main players in international relations.\r\nIn the area of security, we have not yet been able \r\nto overcome serious threats to international peace \r\nand security such as terrorism, drug trafficking, \r\narmed conflict, organized crime, the proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction and illicit trafficking in \r\nweapons and persons. Furthermore, as never before, \r\ntoday we are compelled to face one of the biggest \r\nchallenges resulting from these threats to international \r\npeace and security — large-scale migration around \r\nthe world, which is a significant challenge for the \r\nentire international community. We are aware of its \r\ncauses — terrorism, war, ethnic and religious conflict, \r\nhunger and totalitarian regimes, all of which have \r\nrecently caused the largest displacement of people in \r\nthe history of humankind. The figures are stark and \r\nspeak for themselves. There are currently 260 million \r\npeople who have had to leave their countries of origin. \r\nEvery year more than 1.3 million people abandon their \r\ncountries for the reasons I have mentioned.\r\nIn the light of that situation, Chile’s commitment is \r\ncategorical and clear. We are designing a safe, orderly \r\nand regular migration policy, in line with the New \r\nYork Declaration for Refugees and Migrants and the \r\nglobal compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, \r\nwhich raise the need to establish migration policies that \r\nguarantee safe, orderly and regular migration. We want \r\nto receive and welcome all who enter Chile seeking new \r\nand better lives, who do so with the intention of obeying \r\nour laws, committing to the development of our country \r\nand to integrating into our society. With equal strength \r\nand conviction, however, we want to keep order in \r\nour country and bar those who enter illegally, break \r\nour laws, come to commit crimes or have committed \r\nserious crimes in their countries of origin. By doing so \r\nwe can prevent and impede the entry of drug traffickers \r\nand people involved in organized crime, because all \r\nPresidents and Heads of State and Government are \r\nresponsible for their citizens’ safety, which is of course \r\na key concern for any Government.\r\nOur migration policy seeks to strike a balance \r\nbetween the State’s sovereign right to regulate the \r\nmanner in which migrants enter and remain in our \r\ncountry, on the one hand, and its duty to respect \r\nand guarantee the fundamental rights and duties of \r\nmigrants, on the other, by putting a stop to irregular \r\nimmigration, punishing criminal acts and welcoming \r\nthose who come to integrate legally into our societies \r\nin accordance with the law.\r\nThe second great challenge is development. Six \r\nmonths ago, when I embarked on my second term \r\nas President of Chile, I pledged to undertake a great \r\nmission — transforming Chile into a developed country \r\nwithout poverty and with greater equality of opportunity \r\nand solidarity by the end of the next decade. Genuine \r\ndevelopment is much more than economic growth. We \r\nare therefore talking about comprehensive development \r\nthat encompasses all aspects of our lives, an inclusive \r\ndevelopment that reaches all families, individuals and \r\nregions, and a sustainable development that protects and \r\nis in aligned with nature and the environment. That is \r\nthe genuine development that all peoples and countries \r\nneed and that we almost all ratified through our previous \r\ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nnow through the 17 Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nto which we are committed under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nFor that reason, the importance of defending and \r\nstrengthening multilateralism and free trade, to which \r\nmany have alluded this week, is now severely under \r\nthreats from such things as trade and tariff wars, the \r\nconsequences of which we felt as long ago as the Great \r\nDepression of the previous century. The economic \r\ndimension is, of course, very important. More than \r\never, we need to promote and bolster an international \r\nsystem that is predictable and based on clear and agreed \r\nstandards, fosters free trade and enables mechanisms \r\nfor settling disputes peacefully rather than through \r\nconflict, confrontation or tariff wars.\r\nHowever, we must also think about creating a \r\nculture and an international community that are built \r\non the principles and values of freedom, human dignity, \r\nfull respect for human rights, gender equality and the \r\nfight against climate change and other new emerging \r\nthreats, such as those related to cyberspace.\r\nSuch comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable \r\ndevelopment compels us to implement robust measures \r\naimed at ensuring full equality in terms of rights, \r\ndignity and opportunities for both women and men, \r\nas well as a culture of zero tolerance for violence or \r\ndiscrimination against women. Our true development \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 19/59\r\ncan be measured by the way in which we treat our \r\nsocieties’ most vulnerable members, such as children, \r\nwomen, elderly people, those suffering from disease \r\nand the poorest. In many of those areas, many of \r\nour countries still have a long way to go.\r\nToday our planet faces major threats and challenges, \r\nsuch as a deteriorating environment, global warming, \r\ngrowing desertification, the destruction of the ozone \r\nlayer, the depletion of natural resources, the loss of \r\nbiodiversity, as well as air, water and soil pollution and \r\ndeforestation, to name just a few.\r\nSome time ago, major and well-regarded \r\nmagazines published photographs of the Earth with \r\nthe caption “Save planet Earth”. But that should not \r\nbe our greatest concern. Planet Earth has existed for \r\nmore than 4 billion years and has survived all kinds \r\nof catastrophes — flooding, glaciation, warming and \r\nearthquakes. What is actually at risk is the survival of \r\nthe human race on planet Earth. During its long history, \r\n99 out of every 100 species that have ever existed have \r\nnow disappeared. Naturally, we do not want to add \r\nhuman beings to that sad list of extinct species.\r\nWe know that the environment is changing and that \r\nglobal warming is occurring faster than our efforts to \r\nunderstand, halt and stop it. The alarm bells continue \r\nto sound and our citizens continue to march, and we \r\ncannot claim to be ignorant about it. We have a duty \r\nto respond immediately to nature’s desperate cries for \r\nprotection, so that in turn it can protect us. There is \r\nno time to lose and no reason to procrastinate about \r\nthis, because time is no longer our ally. It is our enemy. \r\nOur generation’s response to this great challenge will \r\nundoubtedly be judged by our children, grandchildren \r\nand other generations to come. The threat of climate \r\nchange and the way we address it will define this and \r\nfuture centuries and requires a vast multilateral effort. \r\nWe are aware that we are dealing with a truly serious, \r\nurgent and growing threat that we can no longer ignore, \r\ndelay or downplay.\r\nNo nation is immune to that threat, but Chile \r\nis especially vulnerable. My country is a veritable \r\nobservatory and natural laboratory, as it contains very \r\ndiverse land, maritime, coastal and glacial ecosystems, \r\namong many others, as well as unique island ecosystems \r\nthat are home to more than 30,000 species of plants, \r\nanimals, fungi and bacteria. In addition, Chile is \r\ngeographically unique because of its natural barriers, \r\nthe Andes range to the east, the Pacific Ocean to the \r\nwest, the Atacama desert to the north and the Antarctic \r\nto the south, which means that we are home to species \r\nfound nowhere else in the world. For example, almost \r\n90 per cent of fish species — the highest percentage \r\nin the world — on Robinson Crusoe Island in the Juan \r\nFernández archipelago are endemic; in other words, \r\nthey are unique to that environment.\r\nHowever, that virtue is also our Achilles heel. Chile, \r\nas a natural observatory, is greatly exposed to the risks \r\nand threats of climate change and global warming. \r\nIn fact, seven of the nine major vulnerability factors \r\nlisted in the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change apply to Chile — low-lying coastal \r\nareas, arid and semi-arid areas, large forested areas, \r\nareas prone to natural disasters, areas prone to drought \r\nand desertification, urban areas with atmospheric \r\npollution problems, and mountainous ecosystems.\r\nThat compels us to seek urgent and effective \r\nsolutions in order to adapt to and address the threat of \r\nglobal warming. As President of Chile, I am especially \r\ncommitted to sustainable development, in other words, \r\nenvironmentally friendly development that respects \r\nnature. A threat that was once remote is now upon \r\nus, and we are currently witnessing the lethal impact \r\nof those changes and their possible future impact on \r\npresent and future generations. There is no time to lose. \r\nWe must take the bull by the horns and do whatever is \r\nnecessary to change the course of history.\r\nWhat has Chile done in that regard? First, we are \r\ncommitted to creating protected areas that preserve \r\ncrucial biodiversity. Chile has been a regional and world \r\nleader in creating protected areas since the beginning \r\nof the last century, starting with the Malleco National \r\nReserve. Today, there are 180 marine and land-protected \r\nareas in Chile covering more than 120 million hectares.\r\nWe are also firmly committed to conserving our \r\noceans, their biodiversity and the sustainable use of \r\ntheir resources. We have already protected more than \r\n13 per cent of our exclusive economic zone, which \r\nstretches along Chile’s approximately 4,200 kilometres \r\nof coastline. And we are on our way to achieving 40 per \r\ncent protection, with the largest marine protected area \r\nin Latin America, one of the largest in the world, on \r\nwondrous Easter Island, or Rapa Nui.\r\nIn addition, the energy path that we are following \r\ntowards a cleaner, safer, more cost-effective and more \r\ndiversified energy matrix that strongly promotes \r\ndecarbonization has enabled us to make significant \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n20/59 18-30067\r\nheadway in developing clean, renewable energy, \r\nparticularly volcanic energy — Chile has 25 per cent \r\nof the world’s active volcanoes — as well as wind and \r\nsolar energy, since Chile is home to a desert with the \r\nhighest solar radiation levels in the world. We are also \r\nmaking great advances in removing fossil fuels from our \r\ntransport system and moving towards electromobility, \r\nwith a more definitive solution that is more compatible \r\nwith those objectives.\r\nMoreover, we are addressing the threat to our planet \r\nposed by plastic. We understand how important it is for \r\nall Governments to act in time to prevent 12 billion \r\ntons — a figure we have almost reached — of plastic \r\nwaste from ending up in natural environments, meaning \r\nthat there would be more plastic bags than fish in our \r\noceans. I am very happy that the first piece of legislation \r\nto be adopted during my current term in office has \r\nbanned the use of plastic bags in Chilean shops. Chile \r\nis the first country in Latin America to restrict the free \r\ndistribution of any kind of single-use plastic bag. The \r\nfact is that one plastic bag takes seconds to produce \r\nand is used, on average, for 15 minutes on the journey \r\nback from the supermarket, but then takes 400 years to \r\nbiodegrade, which means that for a few minutes of use, \r\nnature and humankind must suffer the harmful effects \r\nof one plastic bag for more than 400 years.\r\nOnce and for all, we must address many of those \r\nproblems with a new attitude and abandon the idea \r\nthat the goals of economic growth and the protection \r\nof the environment are incompatible. The fact is that if \r\ngrowth is unsustainable, it will simply cease to exist. \r\nWe must also abandon our throwaway culture and \r\nreturn to embracing one of recycling.\r\nPollution has struck very dramatically and close to \r\nhome in my country, Chile. Over the past few weeks, \r\nthe two communes of Puchuncaví and Quintero, which \r\nhave long been overpolluted, experienced serious \r\nepisodes of environmental pollution, affecting the \r\nhealth of many citizens. In view of the seriousness of \r\nthe situation, I immediately visited the areas concerned \r\nto meet with the authorities and the communities and \r\nto see and experience, with my own eyes and senses, \r\nthe dramatic effects of that environmental disaster. \r\nDuring my visit, I made a promise to Chilean citizens \r\nto rewrite the future for those two communities and \r\nmany others. To that end, we are implementing a \r\nplan to resolve the emergency situation and protect \r\nour citizens’ health. We are also developing a long-\r\nterm solution to enable us to better protect the quality \r\nand health of our water, air and soil through ongoing \r\nmonitoring with the highest available technological \r\nstandards and the implementation of extraordinary \r\nemission standards for polluting companies, as well \r\nas a comprehensive pollution plan that will enable us \r\nto permanently resolve such situations and achieve a \r\ndefinitive solution, putting an end to the so-called \r\nsacrificial zones in our country.\r\nWe know that nature is not a gift inherited from our \r\nparents, and that we therefore cannot use it as we like. \r\nRather, it is a loan from our children, grandchildren and \r\nfuture generations. We must nurture it and return it to \r\nthem in better condition. That challenge must involve \r\nall stakeholders in society. Channelling collective and \r\nmultisectoral efforts requires the commitment of us all. \r\nThat is the aim of the framework law on climate change \r\nthat we are implementing in Chile and that by 2030 \r\nwill enable us to reduce our greenhouse-gas emissions \r\nby 30 per cent compared to the base year.\r\nTo do it, we must incorporate the climate-change \r\nperspective into all public policy and private-sector \r\ncommitments. We are doing just that by incorporating \r\nenvironmental and climate-change policies into our \r\nnational investment system and our evaluation systems \r\nfor public expenditure and environmental impact. \r\nIn addition, we are including those concerns and \r\ncommitments in both bilateral and multilateral trade \r\nagreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive \r\nAgreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which unites \r\n11 countries on both shores of the vast Pacific Ocean, \r\nas well as in the ways in which we are addressing the \r\nprocess of adding new members to the Pacific Alliance.\r\nWithout doubt, those developments have reduced \r\nour carbon emissions and will continue to significantly \r\nreduce them while strengthening our economy. The \r\nchallenge is extremely demanding and requires great \r\ndetermination and ambition. In that regard, we have \r\ntwo important allies, the first of which is technology. \r\nToday, the scientific imagination and innovation and \r\nthe scientific and technological advances that have \r\nemerged from the freedom and creativity of free \r\nmen and women have equipped us with new tools to \r\ncombat this relatively new and serious threat..We must \r\ntherefore continue to boost and foster our technology \r\nand scientific entrepreneurs so that they will join this \r\nfight and not repeat the errors of the past. In recent days \r\nwe learned of an initiative that can clean the rubbish and \r\nplastic out of our oceans more efficiently. In our efforts \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 21/59\r\nto fulfil our commitments, those are the technologies \r\nthat we are using in my country.\r\nMoreover, we have a multilateral system that \r\nenables us to act in a coordinated manner. That is \r\nprecisely the point of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. However, we are aware that bureaucracy often \r\nslows down United Nations efforts. We must therefore \r\nimprove coordination and be able to generate more \r\ndelivery and accountability, while also focusing more \r\non the results and less on the process. As a great United \r\nStates President once remarked, our generation is in a \r\nunique twofold situation. We are the first generation \r\nto feel the impact of climate change and also the last \r\ngeneration that can do something about it.\r\nI shall now turn to human rights — the third \r\nchallenge raised by the late Kofi Annan 20 years \r\nago in this Hall — and the challenge of freedom, \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law. Five years ago, from \r\nthis very rostrum (see A/68/PV.5), I was able to share \r\nthe lessons and teachings of Chileans 40 years after \r\nthe collapse of democracy in our country, and after its \r\nsubsequent recovery. The lessons we have learned have \r\nspecific relevance.\r\nThe first and most important lesson is that there are \r\nalways moral and legal norms that should be respected \r\nby everyone: combatants and non-combatants, civilians \r\nand soldiers, leaders and subordinates, with the result \r\nthat atrocity crimes such as torture, crimes against \r\nhumanity, terrorism, political assassination and forced \r\ndisappearances can never be justified in any context, \r\ntime, place or circumstance. Freedom, democracy, \r\npeace and civic friendship are much more fragile than \r\nwe tend to think, which means that we must never take \r\nthem for granted. They must always be valued, taught, \r\nfostered and protected, because they are like air. When \r\nwe have it, we take it for granted, but when we do not, \r\nit is often too late to get it back.\r\nIn Chile we are now a few days away from marking \r\n30 years since the referendum of 5 October 1988 \r\nthat paved the way for us to regain our freedom and \r\ndemocracy. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nrecall the two major transitions that our generation has \r\nhad to face in Chile. The first of them enabled us to \r\nregain our freedom and democracy, which we achieved \r\nin an intelligent and exemplary manner. Normally such \r\ntransitions take place amid political crisis, economic \r\nchaos and social violence, none of which happened in \r\nour country. We were able to restore our freedom and \r\ndemocracy in an admirable manner.\r\nHowever, that transition is now history. The new \r\ntransition, our transition, that is currently under way \r\nand depends on us consists in transforming Chile, once \r\nthe poorest of Spain’s Latin American colonies, into a \r\ndeveloped country, without poverty and with greater \r\nsocial justice and equal opportunities, in which we can \r\nall develop our talents and life plans and live fuller and \r\nhappier lives, by the end of the next decade. We must \r\ncomplete that transition with the same unity, generosity \r\nand intelligence with which we carried out the transition \r\nthat allowed us to regain our democracy.\r\nOn human rights, I want to clearly and strongly \r\nstate today that human rights, freedom and democracy \r\nknow no borders. I would therefore like to bring to \r\nthe General Assembly the voice of the Venezuelan \r\npeople, which President Maduro’s regime has silenced. \r\nVenezuela is a sister nation that for many long decades \r\nwas a democracy that brought great progress and well-\r\nbeing to its people, generously opening its borders to \r\nmany Latin Americans so that they could find shelter, \r\nwork and opportunity there that were not available in \r\ntheir own countries.\r\nUnfortunately, today Venezuela is governed by \r\na regime that respects none of its principles, neither \r\nfreedom nor democracy nor human rights. It is a society \r\nthat is being torn apart by a moral, political, social \r\nand humanitarian crisis — a moral crisis, because \r\nthe basic values of human rights are not respected; a \r\npolitical crisis, because there is no democracy, rule of \r\nlaw, separation of powers or freedom of expression, \r\nand there are hundreds of political prisoners; and an \r\neconomic crisis, because Venezuela, once the richest \r\ncountry in Latin America, now has less than half the \r\nproduction capacity it had in its heyday.\r\nIndeed, Venezuela is undergoing a tragedy. Its \r\ninhabitants are f leeing from a dismal and perilous \r\nexistence. Many, too many, are literally losing their lives \r\nfor lack of food and medicine. President Maduro, while \r\ndenying the situation, is not letting in the humanitarian \r\naid that many countries are willing to deliver. In recent \r\nyears, more than 2 million Venezuelans have had \r\nto leave their country as a result of the crisis I have \r\njust outlined. I ask myself how a President can be so \r\nambitious and callous that he is willing to cause his \r\nown people such pain and suffering in order to prevail \r\nand cling to power.\r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n22/59 18-30067\r\nHowever, Venezuela is not the only country in that \r\nsituation. The same is happening in countries such \r\nas Nicaragua, in which more than 400 people have \r\nalready died as a result of the violence fostered by the \r\nState and President Ortega’s Government. In fact, the \r\nInter-American Commission on Human Rights, which \r\nhas reported assassinations, extrajudicial executions, \r\nill-treatment, torture and arbitrary detentions in that \r\ncountry, was expelled from Nicaragua a month ago. \r\nThere are also similar occurrences in Cuba, where \r\nfor more than 60 years there has been no freedom, \r\ndemocracy or basic respect for human rights, as \r\nevidenced by its arbitrary detentions and, as in \r\nVenezuela and Nicaragua, its censorship of freedom of \r\nexpression, which is guaranteed under article 19 of the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\r\nChile does not recognize the legitimacy of the \r\nrecent presidential elections in Venezuela, because they \r\ndid not fulfil the basic requirements necessary for free, \r\ndemocratic and transparent elections, in accordance \r\nwith international standards. We will therefore not \r\nrecognize the legitimacy of the new Government that \r\nemerged from the election. Chile will continue to do all \r\nit can, in accordance with international law, to help the \r\nVenezuelan people to regain their freedom, democracy \r\nand human rights and emerge from the sad and tragic \r\ndisaster affecting the country.\r\nFor that to happen, we need the support of the \r\nmultilateral system, in particular the United Nations. \r\nWe believe that the Organization, through the \r\nSecurity Council, should address the democratic and \r\nhumanitarian crises affecting those countries. As I \r\nhave said before, in modern times, freedom, democracy \r\nand respect for human rights do not and should not \r\nrecognize borders. Chile will therefore use all the \r\nmechanisms available under international law and work \r\nwith all its strength and commitment to restore freedom, \r\ndemocracy and human rights in those countries.\r\nI would like to end my statement with a reflection \r\non the current state of the United Nations and the \r\nreforms and updates that many countries think the \r\nUnited Nations now urgently requires. The United \r\nNations, which has contributed to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security on countless occasions \r\nas the cornerstone of multilateralism, today has highly \r\nrestricted and limited powers. We have lost the ability \r\nto prevent crises and to strengthen the institutions of \r\nMember States with the aim of generating a true culture \r\nof democratic resilience that is capable of surviving \r\nbreakdowns, like those suffered in some countries in our \r\nregion. We therefore believe that the time has come for \r\nthe United Nations to modernize, as has been suggested \r\nby many Member States on various occasions, in order \r\nto be able to act more quickly and effectively in the face \r\nof the challenges of the modern age.\r\nThe structure of the United Nations, and especially \r\nits Security Council, is a legacy of the victors in the \r\nSecond World War, which ended more than 70 years \r\nago, and it does not meet the needs and challenges of \r\ncurrent times. In fact, we all know that some permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council exercise or threaten to \r\nuse their right to veto for reasons that are based more on \r\ntheir own interests or those of their allies than on their \r\nduty to preserve peace and security in every corner of \r\nour planet.\r\nThat behaviour has reduced and continues to \r\nreduce the effectiveness of a fundamental organ of the \r\nUnited Nations that not only holds enormous power but \r\nalso has a tremendous responsibility, that of preserving \r\npeace and security on our planet. In addition, the \r\ncurrent composition of the Security Council does not \r\nreflect today’s world and does not adequately represent \r\nentire continents, such as Africa or Latin America, or \r\ncountries such as Germany, India and Japan.\r\nI would therefore like to conclude by emphasizing \r\nthat it is not only development that should be sustainable, \r\nbut also peace. It is precisely at times like these that \r\nthe values we share as an international community \r\nshould guide and illuminate our actions and the path \r\nahead. People must not be united by free trade alone. \r\nWhat should guide us is the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity and respect for the basic values that led to the \r\nformation of the Organization, and it is therefore those \r\nsame values that must illuminate and guide the path to \r\nits future.\r\nOnly by strongly and coherently reviving those \r\nvalues will the United Nations be able to fulfil its \r\nresponsibilities and rise to the challenges of the new \r\nworld we live in. Together with the formidable threats \r\nthat we are confronted with, such as terrorism, global \r\nwarming and mass migration, we also have magnificent \r\nopportunities that are generated by the freedom, \r\nimagination and unlimited creativity of the free men \r\nand women of this world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 23/59\r\nPresident of the Republic of Chile for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Sebastián Piñera Echenique, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Julius Maada Bio, President of the \r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Sierra Leone.\r\nMr. Julius Maada Bio, President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Julius Maada \r\nBio, President of the Republic of Sierra Leone, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bio: It is a distinct honour for me to \r\naddress the General Assembly for the very first time as \r\nPresident of the Republic of Sierra Leone.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of \r\nSierra Leone, I would like to express our heartfelt \r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana and to the United Nations family \r\non the passing of Kofi Atta Annan, former Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations. He served humankind \r\nand the world with distinction, and in our country’s \r\nhour of need he helped to steer it out of a deep abyss \r\nof seemingly intractable war. May he rest in perfect \r\npeace. He always showed us what was possible and the \r\nbest in humankind.\r\nOur commitment to building a peaceful and \r\nmore secure world, as enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, as well as our commitment to the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \r\nand the ongoing reform processes of the United \r\nNations, perfectly resonates with the theme for this \r\nsession, “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. \r\nThe work of the United Nations should continue to \r\nbe guided by the values on which it was founded, \r\nincluding the promotion of peace, security, human \r\nrights, the equality of all nations, social progress and \r\nbetter living standards.\r\nIn April Sierra Leoneans registered their commitment \r\nto democratic governance with yet another peaceful \r\ntransfer of power from a political incumbent to the \r\nopposition. We acknowledge with humility the many \r\nmessages of commendation from various parts of \r\nthe world for our conduct of peaceful and credible \r\npresidential, parliamentary and local council elections, \r\nwhich led to my election as President of the Republic of \r\nSierra Leone.\r\nOn behalf of the people of Sierra Leone, let me \r\nsay that we sincerely appreciate the international \r\ncommunity’s invaluable contributions to facilitating and \r\nmonitoring our electoral process. We acknowledge the \r\nrole played by the United Nations and our development \r\npartners in supporting the successful conduct of \r\nthe elections. We are a successful model of a stable \r\ndemocracy, one that has evolved and matured over 20 \r\nyears from the chaos and lawlessness of civil conflict.\r\nHowever, stable democracies must also be \r\nsustainable. Sierra Leoneans voted for a change of \r\nGovernment and for a new direction and the right \r\ndirection. My Government is ready to maximize \r\nour country’s potential for development, because we \r\nbelieve that development sustains emerging, successful \r\nand stable democracies like ours. The international \r\ncommunity has invested hugely in facilitating and \r\nstabilizing Sierra Leone’s democracy, and it must \r\ncontinue to play its role in sustaining Sierra Leone’s \r\ndemocracy, in collaboration with the Government and \r\nthe people of Sierra Leone.\r\nIn addition to our firm commitment to good \r\ngovernance and the prudent and accountable \r\nmanagement of our nation’s resources, we are ready \r\nto foster a congenial environment that is conducive to \r\ncredible gross domestic product growth. We call on \r\nour bilateral partners to help us deliver on our people’s \r\nexpectations through the provision of development funds \r\nand technical assistance and the cultivation of valuable \r\ntrade links. We cordially invite all credible investors \r\nto an open and congenial investment environment, \r\nin which all their investments are guaranteed and \r\nprotected by our relevant laws. We have worked \r\nassiduously to remove barriers to investment, and I ask \r\nall such investors to help us sustain our democracy.\r\nThe Assembly made a historic pledge during the \r\n2005 World Summit to strengthen the United Nations \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n24/59 18-30067\r\nwith a view to enhancing its authority and effectiveness, \r\nas well as its capacity to address effectively, and in \r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter, the full range of the challenges of our time. \r\nA number of gains have been made, including the \r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nHuman Rights Council and the adoption of resolutions \r\non the responsibility to protect. Those are laudable \r\ngains, but the need for reform is also urgent and \r\nimperative. We should now endeavour to demonstrate \r\nthe political will to redress specifically the historical \r\ninjustice done to the African continent.\r\nThe present geopolitical realities compel us to work \r\nto comprehensively reform the Security Council in \r\norder to ensure equitable representation in every organ \r\nof the United Nations. Africa is the only continent \r\nwithout representation in the permanent category of \r\nthe Security Council, and is also underrepresented in \r\nthe non-permanent category. Africa’s demand for two \r\npermanent seats with all the rights and prerogatives \r\nof current members, including the right of veto, and \r\nfor two additional non-permanent seats, is a matter \r\nof common justice and the right to have an equal say \r\nin decision-making on issues that affect the African \r\nregion. It is time that we addressed without further \r\ndelay the long-standing injustice and imbalance that is \r\nbeing perpetuated in the present configuration of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nAfrica is committed to the ongoing reforms that will \r\nmake the United Nations fit for purpose in the twenty-\r\nfirst century. As the Coordinator of the African Union \r\nCommittee of Ten Heads of State and Government \r\non the reform of the United Nations, we reiterate \r\nour concern about this body’s continued inaction on \r\nadopting measures that will enable Africa to take its \r\nrightful place in the Council. Unless and until we are \r\nable to contend with the reform of the Security Council, \r\nthe most critical question of the day, the Organization \r\nwill remain seemingly constituted on undemocratic and \r\ndiscriminatory principles.\r\nI want to emphasize the urgent importance of \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council by \r\npointing out that 1.2 billion of the world’s 7.5 billion \r\npeople are African. Those 1.2 billion continue to \r\ncontribute their fair share to maintaining world peace \r\nand security. About 70 per cent of the decisions taken in \r\nthe Security Council ultimately affect those 1.2 billion \r\nAfricans. Those 1.2 billion people, who are affected by \r\nmore than 70 per cent of United Nations resolutions, are \r\ntherefore asking why they should be excluded from the \r\nSecurity Council, where they simply want their voices \r\nto be fully represented.\r\nMy Government’s blueprint document for moving \r\nour country forward, entitled “The New Direction”, \r\nfocuses on taking Sierra Leone beyond the phase of \r\npeacebuilding and consolidation to firmly establishing \r\na stable, peaceful, open and pluralistic democracy \r\nthat is a responsible and committed member of the \r\ninternational community of nations. At the domestic \r\nlevel, my Government has established priority areas, \r\nincluding job creation, access to quality education, \r\nyouth empowerment, the empowerment of women \r\nand the disabled, combating graft and corruption and \r\nfostering a culture of accountability and transparency, \r\nensuring effective and efficient public-service \r\ndelivery and strengthening civic responsibility and \r\nnational cohesion.\r\nGuided by both our specific situation and \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), our \r\nGovernment’s initiative and policy actions involve \r\nstrengthening our democratic institutions, opening up \r\ndemocratic spaces, promoting democratic dialogue and \r\ncreating a more just and equal society. We see those as \r\nprecursors to the sustainable growth of our economy \r\nand our development as a nation.\r\nAmong other things, my Government’s economic \r\nand development policies, as I stated earlier, create \r\na congenial environment for credible private-sector \r\ninvestment and entrepreneurship. We are eager to work \r\nwith and listen to the private sector. Our policies are \r\nenabling, and our investment framework is attractive. \r\nWe can ensure the full legal protection of all investments, \r\nand we can ensure predictable and profitable revenue \r\nstreams and returns on investments.\r\nSierra Leone is starting to adopt renewable \r\nenergy. We now need public and private investment \r\nfor commercial and industrial uses, such as powering \r\nhotels, agriculture and small-scale manufacturing. My \r\ncountry is endowed with sufficient renewable energy \r\nresources in solar irradiation, coastal and offshore \r\nwind and mini-hydro and bioenergy. My Government’s \r\ntarget of 60 per cent renewable energy capacity by 2030 \r\nis practicable, especially in terms of generating growth \r\nin rural areas.\r\nSierra Leone, like most developing countries, has \r\nbeen on the expensive and dirty liquid-fuel treadmill \r\nsince its independence. My Government is seeking \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 25/59\r\ninternational technical assistance and capacity-building \r\nfor migrating a percentage of the country’s power \r\ngeneration away from heavy liquid fuel to natural gas \r\nthat is trucked to site. In that regard, my Government \r\nis seeking collaboration with local companies and \r\nengineering companies from around the world.\r\nWe believe that investment in renewable energy \r\nsources and liquefied natural gas will help us to \r\nmeet SDG 7 by modernizing our energy-generation \r\nsystems, which will have a multiplier effect by helping \r\nour country to meet the SDGs for poverty alleviation \r\nthrough job creation and increased investments in \r\nhealth, water delivery and cities. We are determined \r\nto make Sierra Leone the renewable energy hub of the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States region. \r\nOur vision is positive for our world’s climate, for \r\nforeign and local investors and development and for \r\nour country.\r\nMy Government has a bold vision for science, \r\ntechnology and innovation. In that regard, I have \r\nestablished the first directorate of science, technology \r\nand innovation. We have set an ambitious and achievable \r\ntarget for 2025 of developing solid information and \r\ncommunication technologies infrastructure that will \r\nsupport graft-free governance and the delivery of \r\neffective, reliable, responsive and transparent services, \r\nranging from banking and business to education, \r\nagricultural extension, revenue collection, health-care \r\ndelivery, access to justice, governance, tourism, trade \r\nand the rule of law.\r\nWe have undertaken extensive reforms, in line \r\nwith the SDG 16+ Forum, to create a peaceful, just and \r\ninclusive Sierra Leone with resilient institutions. We \r\nare engaged in judiciary and criminal justice reform \r\nand, in collaboration with civil-society and partner \r\norganizations, we continue to build on gains in the \r\ndelivery of justice that take into account disparities in \r\naccess to justice.\r\nWe have launched a focused and sustained campaign \r\nagainst graft, waste and the misuse of public funds. Our \r\nrevenue authority has streamlined revenue collection \r\nand reduced tax evasion and theft. We have launched a \r\nfree quality education programme that provides access \r\nto basic and secondary education for girls and boys of \r\nschool age.\r\nWe are building, retooling and opening up our \r\ngovernance, health-care, financial and other institutions \r\nso as to empower our women and young people, the \r\naged and our elderly and disabled compatriots. We are \r\nalso reviewing discriminatory laws and practices, and \r\nwill engage communities in order to change traditional \r\nstructures that have excluded such persons. In \r\nparticular, our young people, like their counterparts all \r\nover the world, are energized and eager to make Sierra \r\nLeone a better place. Our development policies and \r\npriorities harness their vibrancy and direct it towards \r\ntargeted education and skills training, entrepreneurship \r\nand strong civic participation.\r\nWe are working on a comprehensive biometric \r\nidentification system, so that all citizens can fully \r\nparticipate in the economic and civic life of our nation. \r\nIn particular, we acknowledge the support of the United \r\nNations Development Programme, Kiva and the United \r\nNations Capital Development Fund in strengthening \r\nour national digital identification system. With their \r\nassistance we are modernizing our credit reference \r\nbureau, which will radically transform our financial \r\ninclusion landscape and the ease of doing business in \r\nour country.\r\nWe are fully committed to promoting a free \r\npress, rescinding adversarial public-order laws and \r\nprotecting and promoting the right of citizens to know \r\nand access information. We have instituted a national \r\ncivic-education commission to further ensure the \r\nunrestricted participation of every Sierra Leonean in \r\nour stable democracy. For all of these efforts, we need \r\na constructive yet intensive and sustained engagement \r\nwith our bilateral partners and partner institutions.\r\nMy Government is committed to increasing \r\nequitable access to quality health care for Sierra \r\nLeoneans. We call on our bilateral partner organizations \r\nand private investors to help us invest in and develop \r\nour critical institutional, technical and human-resource \r\ncapacity, as well as the infrastructure needed to ensure \r\nthe delivery of quality health care for Sierra Leoneans.\r\nWe recall with great appreciation the magnanimity \r\nof the world as we dealt with recent deadly epidemics \r\nsuch as the Ebola virus disease, and the sustained \r\ninterventions of our partners in helping us to battle \r\ntropical diseases, including malaria, cholera and \r\ntyphoid. We need more help in all those areas and in \r\nexpanding and maintaining all immunization levels at \r\n100 per cent. My Government has increased health-care \r\ninvestment, but that will not be enough. We call on the \r\ninternational community to enhance our institutional \r\nand technical capacity for preventive health care and for \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n26/59 18-30067\r\nmanaging public health and environmental sanitation \r\nissues, including waste management and storm-drain \r\nwater management in urban areas.\r\nSierra Leone welcomes the renewed commitment of \r\nthe United Nations to conflict prevention, as embodied \r\nin its Charter. The world needs a stronger United \r\nNations more than ever before, as well as consistent \r\nand effective multilateralism that collectively evaluates \r\nand cooperatively resolves humankind’s common \r\nchallenges, from trade to climate change and from world \r\nsecurity to our common humanity and our collective \r\nsocial and economic well-being. Our foreign policy \r\nshould be driven by the golden rules of impartiality and \r\ncooperation. That is the only way that humankind can \r\nrespond effectively, without hesitation, to the global \r\nchallenges that we all face today.\r\nWe acknowledge the continued relevance of the \r\nUnited Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, \r\nCombat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small \r\nArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and the \r\nInternational Instrument to Enable States to Identify \r\nand Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit \r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons, which constitute \r\nthe global framework for preventing, combating and \r\neradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons in all its aspects. We welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reform agenda on sustaining peace, including \r\nthe efforts to reform peacekeeping, which is one of the \r\nmost effective tools available to the United Nations for \r\npeace and security.\r\nMy Government will bolster Sierra Leone’s \r\nparticipation in the promotion and maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, as a troop- and \r\npolice-contributing country, and in supporting United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations, especially with the \r\ndeployment of formed units or contingents of both \r\nmilitary and police. Sierra Leone stands ready to \r\ncontinue contributing to world peace and security.\r\nWith a strong belief in a shared vision and a \r\ncommon destiny, Sierra Leone stands with the world \r\nin meeting global challenges. Sierra Leoneans also \r\nlook to the world for the help it can offer in helping to \r\nconsolidate Sierra Leone as an economically developed, \r\nopen, inclusive and pluralistic democracy. As we often \r\nsay, we are a country with a faith that wisdom inspires \r\nand one with a zeal that never tires. We are optimistic, \r\nbecause our country stands ready, on the threshold of a \r\nnew direction.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Sierra Leone for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Julius Maada Bio, President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the \r\nState of Palestine\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe State of Palestine.\r\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State \r\nof Palestine, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud \r\nAbbas, President of the State of Palestine, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Abbas (spoke in Arabic): Jerusalem is not \r\nfor sale and the rights of the Palestinian people are not \r\nfor bargaining. Peace be upon the General Assembly. \r\nWe will keep our faith in peace, we will maintain peace, \r\nand we will achieve our independent State with peace, \r\nbecause God is with us, our cause is just, our people \r\nhave sacrificed a great deal and Assembly members \r\nare supporters of peace. God Almighty is against those \r\nwho are unjust. Allah will suffice me, and He is the \r\nbest guardian.\r\nDuring last year’s general debate, I came before \r\nthe Assembly (see A/72/PV.8) appealing for freedom, \r\nindependence and justice for my oppressed people, \r\nwho have been suffering under the yoke of Israeli \r\noccupation for 51 years. I return to the Assembly today, \r\nas that colonial occupation continues to suffocate \r\nus, undermining our unwavering efforts to build the \r\ninstitutions of our cherished State, which the General \r\nAssembly recognized in the year 2011.\r\nThis year the Palestinian National Council, \r\nwhich is the Parliament of Palestine, convened and \r\nrenewed the legitimacy of our national institutions \r\nthrough the election of a new leadership for the \r\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the sole \r\nand legitimate representative of the Palestinian \r\npeople. The Parliament took important decisions that \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 27/59\r\ncommitted me to reconsidering the political, economic \r\nand security agreements that have been reached with \r\nthe Israeli Government, and to reviewing the future \r\nof the Palestinian National Authority, which has, \r\nunfortunately, been rendered powerless. In addition, \r\nthe Parliament asked me to suspend the Palestinian \r\nrecognition of the State of Israel until Israel in turn \r\nrecognizes the State of Palestine based on the 4 June \r\n1967 borders. Moreover, it requested that I approach \r\ninternational courts, including the International \r\nCriminal Court, to have them investigate the Israeli \r\nGovernment’s breaches of the treaties it has signed, \r\nand investigate the aggressions of the Israeli army and \r\nthe terrorist practices of settlers against our people, our \r\nland and our holy sites. The Assembly will note that \r\nevery single day, Israeli settlers, and even the Israeli \r\narmy, desecrate our holy sites, in particular the Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\r\nLast July, Israel adopted a racist law that crossed \r\nevery red line. It is called the Jewish nation-State law. It \r\ndenies the connection of the Palestinian people to their \r\nhistoric homeland and dismisses their right to self-\r\ndetermination, their history and the United Nations \r\nresolutions relevant to the Palestinian question. It also \r\ndenies the agreements concluded with Israel, which \r\nwill inevitably lead to the creation of a single racist, \r\napartheid State, thereby nullifying the possibility of a \r\ntwo-State solution. Israel practices racism but has now \r\ncrowned its practice with that new law.\r\nMr. Bessho (Japan), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe new law also discriminates against Arab \r\ncitizens of Israel, granting the right to self-determination \r\nin the State of Israel exclusively to Jews and thereby \r\nlegalizing discrimination against the Arab citizens, \r\nwho make up 20 per cent of the population of Israel. In \r\naddition, the law discriminates against other non-Jews \r\nwho have immigrated into Israel, stripping them of their \r\ncitizenship rights. At least 5 per cent of Israel’s current \r\npopulation are non-Jews, mostly Christian and Muslim \r\nimmigrants, many of whom emigrated from the former \r\nSoviet Union. Those people have also been stripped of \r\ntheir rights to citizenship.\r\nThe new law constitutes a gross political and legal \r\nviolation, as well as a real threat that reminds us of \r\nthe apartheid State that existed in South Africa. We \r\ntherefore strongly reject and condemn it. We further \r\ncall on the international community and the Assembly \r\nto take action to reject and condemn it as a racist and \r\nillegal law that is null and void, as the United Nations \r\ndid when it condemned the former apartheid State of \r\nSouth Africa in several resolutions, bearing in mind \r\nthat thousands of Jews and Israeli citizens have also \r\nrejected the new law and demonstrated against it. \r\nFifty-six of the Knesset’s 120 members have rejected \r\nit, because they deem it a law of racial discrimination. \r\nI therefore call on the United Nations to follow in the \r\nfootsteps of those Israeli citizens who have rejected it.\r\nThat racist law talks about the so-called land \r\nof Israel. Could Assembly members ask the Israeli \r\nGovernment what exactly the land of Israel is? What \r\nare the borders of the State of Israel? I challenge anyone \r\nto give me an answer and bring me a map that shows \r\nIsrael’s borders. That racist law constitutes another \r\nstigma for the State of Israel and for anyone who keeps \r\nsilent about it, as well as about other Israeli laws that \r\nlegitimize piracy, the confiscation of land and the \r\nseizure of the funds of the Palestinian people.\r\nWe have always engaged positively with the various \r\ninitiatives of the international community that seek to \r\nachieve peace between us and the Israelis, including \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative, which was recognized by the \r\nSecurity Council in resolution 1515 (2003).\r\nWe have also been dealing with the Administration \r\nof President Trump from the beginning of his tenure in \r\nthe same positive spirit, and we welcomed his promise \r\nto launch a peace initiative. I have met with him on \r\nnumerous occasions. While we eagerly awaited his \r\npeace initiative, we were shocked by the decisions and \r\nactions he took that completely contradict the role and \r\ncommitment of his Administration to the peace process. \r\nIn November 2017, his Administration made a decision \r\nto close the PLO office in Washington, D.C. He then \r\nannounced his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital \r\nof Israel and moved his country’s Embassy from Tel \r\nAviv to Jerusalem. He even boasts that he has taken the \r\nissues of Jerusalem, refugees, settlements and security \r\noff the negotiating table.\r\nAll such decisions threaten the Palestinian national \r\ncause and constitute a violation of international law \r\nand the relevant United Nations resolutions. The \r\nUnited States Administration went even further in \r\nits aggression by cutting assistance to the Palestinian \r\nNational Authority, the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\n(UNRWA) and Palestinian hospitals in occupied East \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n28/59 18-30067\r\nJerusalem. Then they talk about humanitarian aid, and \r\neven that they have already stopped.\r\nWith all of those decisions, the Administration has \r\nreneged on previous United States commitments and \r\nundermined the possibility of a two-State solution, \r\nwhile revealing the falsity of its claims of concern about \r\nthe humanitarian conditions of the Palestinian people. \r\nIt is very ironic that the United States Administration \r\nstill talks about what it calls the “deal of the century”. \r\nWhat is there left for the Administration to offer the \r\nPalestinian people? Humanitarian solutions alone? If \r\nit has removed Jerusalem, refugees, security and other \r\nissues from the negotiation table, what is left for a \r\npolitical solution in the Middle East?\r\nThe United States Congress continues to insist on \r\nviewing the PLO as a terrorist organization, although it \r\nis recognized as the sole and legitimate representative \r\nof the Palestinian people by the overwhelming majority \r\nof countries of the world, including Israel. However, the \r\nUnited States Congress continues to claim that the PLO \r\nis a terrorist organization, even though it is recognized \r\nby Israel, while the State of Palestine is cooperating \r\nwith a majority of countries of the world, including the \r\nUnited States, to combat terrorism. Why is there then \r\nsuch animosity towards the Palestinian people, who \r\nare suffering under the yoke of an occupation that is \r\nsupported by the United States?\r\nWe would like to tell that Administration that our \r\nposition is firm and clear for all to see. We challenge \r\nthem to find a single mistake that we have made during \r\nour long journey. However, the United States Congress \r\nsays that the PLO is a terrorist organization. Why? I do \r\nnot know. The Congress has decided and we must listen.\r\nFor years, we have affirmed to the United \r\nStates Administration our willingness to establish \r\na Palestinian-American committee to examine the \r\npolitical and legal status of the PLO, as a means of \r\ndemonstrating to the Administration that the PLO \r\nis committed to achieving peace and combating \r\nterrorism, as well as showing that the decision of the \r\nCongress regarding the PLO is arbitrary, unlawful and \r\nunjustified, while the Congress deliberately ignores \r\nthe official agreement between the PLO and the United \r\nStates Administration on combating terrorism, an \r\nagreement that we have also concluded with 83 other \r\ncountries. We have protocols with 83 countries under \r\nthe heading of combating terrorism, including the \r\nUnited States. However, the United States Congress \r\ncalls us terrorists.\r\nDespite all of that, I renew from this rostrum my call \r\nto President Trump to rescind his decisions and decrees \r\nregarding Jerusalem, refugees and settlements, which \r\ncontravene international law and the relevant United \r\nNations resolutions, as well as the understandings \r\nthat we have reached aimed at salvaging the peace \r\nprocess and achieving security and stability for future \r\ngenerations. Incidentally, here is an example of those \r\nunderstandings. There is a letter signed by the United \r\nStates Administration and ourselves concerning many \r\nissues, but the Administration now ignores all of them.\r\nConsistent with our commitment to peace and a \r\ntwo-State solution, and the negotiations that we never \r\nrejected leading to their achievement, I challenge \r\nanyone to cite a single instance in which we refused \r\nto come to the negotiation table. On the contrary, we \r\nhave been invited more than once by several countries \r\nin this very Hall to sit down with the Israelis and \r\nwith Mr. Netanyahu. Every single time, I accepted. \r\nI challenge anyone to tell me that I ever refused or \r\nthat he accepted even once. We have never refused \r\nthose negotiations, because we want to rescue the \r\npeace process. I appeared before the Security Council \r\non 20 February of this year (see S/PV.8183) and \r\npresented an initiative calling for the convening of an \r\ninternational peace conference based on the relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and internationally endorsed \r\nterms of reference. Such a conference should involve \r\nbroad international participation, including of regional \r\nand international stakeholders, led by the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council and the Quartet. We \r\nwill circulate to Members a document laying out the \r\ninitiative in its entirety and hope that the Assembly will \r\nadopt it.\r\nIn that regard, I reiterate that we are not at all \r\nagainst negotiations, and we have never once rejected \r\nthem. We will continue to extend our hand to achieve \r\npeace. We believe in peace as the only path to reach our \r\ncause, as I said at the beginning of my statement. We \r\ndo not believe in violence and terrorism. We miss no \r\nopportunity to reiterate that fact. What is required of us? \r\nNegotiations on the basis of international legitimacy? \r\nNone of the international legitimacy resolutions since \r\n1947 has been respected up to now, so what solutions \r\nare we talking about?\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 29/59\r\nPeace in our region cannot be realized without an \r\nindependent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital including all the holy sites. Some people try \r\nto outsmart us by asserting that our capital is in Abu \r\nDeis and other places surrounding Jerusalem. That \r\nis a manipulation of words. No. Our capital is East \r\nJerusalem, not “in East Jerusalem”. I would ask others \r\nnot to try to outsmart us by saying “Abu Deis” or “in \r\nEast Jerusalem” so that they can pick and choose an \r\narea here or there. No, it is East Jerusalem, which has \r\nbeen occupied since 1967, that is our capital.\r\nPeace is not possible otherwise, because there can be \r\nno peace in a State of temporary and unknown borders, \r\nlike the State of Israel with its unknown borders. They \r\ninvented the idea of a State with temporary borders \r\nand said: “We will give you a State but with unknown \r\nborders”. Subsequently, they said, “Let us talk”. No, we \r\nunconditionally want a State with very well-defined \r\nborders and rights. Only then can we coexist with \r\nthe Israelis.\r\nThere are 138 States in the Assembly that have \r\nrecognized the State of Palestine, recently joined \r\nby Colombia. That makes 139. I therefore call on \r\nthe countries of the world that have yet to recognize \r\nthe State of Palestine to make that long-overdue \r\nrecognition happen. I can no longer see a convincing \r\nreason justifying the continued delay in the recognition \r\nof the State of Palestine by certain countries. In that \r\nregard, I want to draw the Assembly’s attention to the \r\nfact that in 2019 the State of Palestine will chair the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. Ten minutes ago, I met His \r\nExcellency President Al Sisi of Egypt in a conference \r\nroom, and he announced that we have been freely \r\nelected by 134 countries to chair the Group of 77 and \r\nChina. Nevertheless, there are certain countries that \r\nsay, “We recognize both countries”. If so, why do they \r\nnot recognize Palestine? That is entirely unacceptable. \r\nWe tell those countries that if they recognize us, it does \r\nnot mean that we will not pursue negotiations. On the \r\ncontrary, that will bolster our international standing, \r\nand, together with their support, we will be able to \r\nparticipate in negotiations assisted by their recognition \r\nof the State of Palestine. That recognition should not be \r\nunilateral in the sense of recognizing one State only, \r\nwhile refusing to recognize the other. They have to \r\nrecognize both States.\r\nI would like to remind the Assembly once again \r\nthat Israel has not implemented a single one of the \r\nhundreds of General Assembly resolutions on this topic. \r\nThe General Assembly has adopted 705 resolutions on \r\nthe problem since 1947. And the Security Council has \r\nadopted 86 resolutions since 1948. Not a single resolution \r\nhas been implemented by Israel. Unfortunately, I have \r\nto say frankly that Israel is supported in that by the \r\nUnited States. The General Assembly gave us 139 \r\nvotes in favour, while 42 States abstained. Only eight \r\ncountries voted against. For how long will Israel be an \r\noutlaw, do whatever it wishes and act as a rebel backed \r\nby whomever it wants?\r\nWe are resisting the Israeli occupation by legitimate \r\nmeans that have been recognized by the United Nations \r\nand include primarily peaceful popular resistance. \r\nWe will use no other means, only peaceful popular \r\nresistance. Is that illegal? By contrast, Israeli settlers \r\nare using weapons against the Palestinian people. They \r\ndestroy cities, towns and villages with their weapons. \r\nI am not talking about the army and the police. I am \r\ntalking about the Israeli settlers. We reject and will \r\ncontinue to reject violence and the use of force. We will \r\nreject every type of weapon and will not accept the use \r\nof arms anywhere. We call on the world to pursue efforts \r\nto achieve disarmament, including of both nuclear and \r\ntraditional weapons.\r\nWe currently face a problem in Khan Al-Ahmar, \r\nwhere Israel is insistent on destroying a village that has \r\nbeen populated by Palestinians for more than 50 years. \r\nIf Israel destroys that village, it will be destroying \r\nthe unity of the West Bank, which will consequently \r\nbe divided into north and south. That is what Israel \r\nwants to do. Does the Assembly agree with that? There \r\nis also the continued aggression against the Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque. Does the Assembly remember the previous \r\nattacks on Al-Aqsa, which were stopped by peaceful \r\npopular resistance? We are now being told that the \r\nIsraeli Supreme Court will approve a decision to divide \r\nAl-Aqsa by time and space. We will definitely not \r\naccept that, and I am sure that people with courage, \r\ndignity and a desire for peace will not accept it either. \r\nIsrael should bear the brunt. Its senseless thuggery must \r\ncome to an end. Every day there is a new decision taken \r\nas though we do not exist.\r\nA United Nations resolution (resolution ES-\r\n10/20) was successfully adopted for our international \r\nprotection, because every day we are being attacked, \r\nand we are not capable of protecting ourselves. That \r\nresolution was adopted, but who will implement \r\nit? In all honesty, it is not sufficient for the General \r\nAssembly to adopt a resolution without implementing \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n30/59 18-30067\r\nit just like other resolutions. The General Assembly \r\nmust respect its own resolutions. We applauded that \r\nresolution, but it is not being implemented. Please, tell \r\nus how we can implement that resolution. That is the \r\nAssembly’s responsibility.\r\nWhile we welcome the economic and humanitarian \r\nsupport being provided through legitimate international \r\ninstitutions to our people in the West Bank and Gaza \r\nStrip, we reject the notion that such support can be \r\nconsidered a substitute for a political settlement. Our \r\ncause has many humanitarian aspects, but with a \r\npolitical settlement, that humanitarian aid would not \r\nbe needed. Do not try to fool us by saying that the \r\nAssembly is helping us.\r\nWe want the right to the self-determination of our \r\npeople, no more, no less. Any people, large or small, \r\nshould enjoy the right to self-determination. There are \r\n13 million Palestinians around the world. Why are we \r\nbeing denied the right to self-determination? It would \r\nharm no one. We want to establish an independent \r\nState that will live alongside the State of Israel. What is \r\nwrong with that? What crime we would be committing?\r\nWe are facing another problem. We continue \r\nto make genuine and serious efforts to put an end to \r\nthe current division in our governance and achieve \r\nreconciliation despite the many obstacles preventing \r\nus from attaining those aims. To this day, we still \r\nuphold our responsibilities towards our people in the \r\nGaza Strip.\r\nWe express our appreciation to our Arab brethren, \r\nparticularly our brother Arab Republic of Egypt, for \r\ntheir efforts to end the division, hoping that those efforts \r\nwill be successful. We entered into an agreement, with \r\nEgypt as a sponsor, on 12 October 2017. The agreement \r\nis very simple. The Palestinian Government will carry \r\nout its responsibilities, both in Gaza and in the West \r\nBank, and then we will establish our State on a basis of \r\nunified law, authority, regime and legitimate arms. We \r\nreject the notion of militias. However, that agreement \r\nhas not been accepted by the other party. Perhaps, over \r\nthe coming days, we will witness a final round of talks \r\nbefore taking the next steps. I would like to sum up by \r\nsaying the following.\r\nFirst, the Palestinian population numbers about \r\n13 million human beings, even if not everyone views \r\nthem as human beings. We are not superfluous people. \r\nA population is never superfluous, regardless of its size. \r\nWhy are we treated as a superfluous people that the \r\nworld should get rid of? That is totally unacceptable. \r\nYet we are patient and steadfast, and we believe in \r\npeace and in peaceful means. We want to be viewed as \r\nhumans. We are not superfluous.\r\nSecondly, we have entered into agreements with \r\nthe United States Administration, which has, however, \r\nreneged on all those agreements. We are committed \r\nto and will abide by our part of the agreements, but if \r\nthe United States Administration fails to honour them, \r\nthen we will not abide by them either. So an agreement \r\nshould be respected by all parties to it. I respect those \r\nagreements fully, but if the other side does not respect \r\nthem, I will not respect them or be committed to them \r\neither. The United States wishes to act as a mediator, \r\nand yet we see now that the United States cannot \r\nsingle-handedly act as a mediator. We have the Middle \r\nEast Quartet, which any country can join, whether from \r\nEurope, the Americas, Africa or even the Arab region. \r\nAny country may join the Quartet to act as a mediator \r\nbetween Palestine and Israel, but the United States \r\ncannot act as the sole mediator, because it is too biased \r\ntowards Israel.\r\nThirdly, there are also agreements with Israel, such \r\nas the Oslo Accords and the Paris Agreement. Those \r\nagreements have all been abrogated by Israel, and we \r\ncall on it to re-engage with them. If it does not, we \r\nwill certainly not uphold our commitments. We have \r\nalso concluded an agreement with Hamas, and our \r\nbrothers in Egypt recognize that we have upheld our \r\nside of the agreement. However, Hamas has failed to \r\nfulfil its obligations, which is why we will not bear \r\nany responsibility from now on for the failure of that \r\nagreement, if Hamas insists on rejecting it. I would \r\nlike to be perfectly clear that we will not bear any \r\nresponsibility while Hamas continues to refuse to abide \r\nby the agreement.\r\nDespite all the injustice we experience from the \r\nworld, we will never resort to violence or terrorism. We \r\nwill continue to combat violence and terrorism all over \r\nthe world. We will never accept aggression against any \r\ncountry, whether that country recognizes us or not and \r\nwhether it likes us or not.\r\nI would like to make a very important point. The \r\nUnited States Administration stated that the number \r\nof Palestinian refugees is only 40,000. How was that \r\nnumber calculated? It need only consult UNRWA to see \r\nthat the number it has calculated is wrong. It does not \r\nwant to consult UNRWA; rather, it wants to obliterate \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 31/59\r\nit, so as to end the refugee issue forever. UNRWA was \r\nestablished in 1949 in order to help the Palestinian \r\nrefugees until their issue is resolved. To this day, that \r\nissue has not been resolved. Of 13 million Palestinians, \r\nthere are still 6 million refugees — not 40,000, as claimed \r\nby the United States Administration. That number has \r\nbeen arrived at haphazardly by the Administration, just \r\nthe way it decided to abolish UNRWA and expected the \r\nworld to agree with it. No, that will never happen.\r\nLastly, I call on our people to remain patient and \r\nsteadfast and to continue to make sacrifices until we \r\nachieve independence and self-determination, with the \r\nestablishment of an independent State with Jerusalem \r\nas its capital, not merely “in Jerusalem”. Let them not \r\nfool us. I pay tribute to our righteous martyrs and our \r\ncourageous prisoners. Israel considers them criminals. \r\nWhy? Israel has thousands of people who have attacked \r\nall kinds of people and are considered heroes. Why is it \r\nthat the person who killed Yitzhak Rabin is considered \r\na hero, while our people are criminals?\r\nI send greetings to our heroic martyrs and prisoners. \r\nI would like to say to everyone that soon the dawn of \r\nfreedom and independence will shine and the dark \r\noccupation will come to an end, God willing.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the State of \r\nPalestine for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State \r\nof Palestine, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Donald Tusk, President of the \r\nEuropean Council\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\na statement by the President of the European Council.\r\nMr. Donald Tusk, President of the European \r\nCouncil, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Donald Tusk, President \r\nof the European Council, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Tusk (European Council): The European \r\nUnion is fighting intensely to preserve the rules-based \r\ninternational order, which is currently under great \r\nstrain with regard to trade, security, climate change and \r\nhuman rights. We say that not only as countries that \r\nstrongly support the United Nations, but as a continent \r\nthat cares deeply about respect, mutual understanding \r\nand solidarity among nations.\r\nAs leaders, we must equip the United Nations with \r\nthe means to successfully fulfil its mandate. More \r\nunity and collective actions are needed in the struggle \r\nagainst conflict, poverty and famine, terrorism and the \r\nmass displacement of people, as evident in Venezuela, \r\nSyria, Myanmar and many other places. To that end, \r\nthe European Union firmly supports the current effort \r\nto reform the United Nations. Those reforms are much \r\nneeded and overdue. Their urgency is clear, and their \r\nimplementation is essential.\r\nThe European Union is taking on more \r\nresponsibility for security matters. We have initiated \r\nambitious cooperation among our countries’ militaries. \r\nWe are ready to step up our help to our neighbours \r\nthrough crisis-management missions, capacity-building \r\nand peacekeeping in cooperation with others, including \r\nNATO, the African Union and the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. The European \r\nUnion also supports the Action for Peacekeeping \r\ninitiative and expects it to produce more effective and \r\nbetter resourced global security solutions.\r\nEurope has taken action against the increased use \r\nof disinformation and outside propaganda to interfere \r\nin open and democratic elections. The anonymity \r\nof cyberspace is used by external actors to cloak \r\nmalicious political interference. It is not just a problem \r\nfor Europe; many others here today have been similarly \r\naffected. The United Nations should help expose that \r\nphenomenon, attribute responsibility and increase \r\ndemocratic resilience.\r\nOne hundred years after the birth of Nelson \r\nMandela, we commemorate his triumph over apartheid \r\nin South Africa. I am very pleased that the occasion \r\ncoincides with deeper ties between the African Union \r\nand the European Union. The summit of our two Unions \r\nin Abidjan last November was key. Thanks to excellent \r\ncooperation between the African Union, the European \r\nUnion and the United Nations, we have so far helped \r\nmore than 30,000 people leave Libya through voluntary \r\nhumanitarian returns. We want to expand the work \r\nwith our partners in other areas. Education, investment \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n32/59 18-30067\r\nin development, climate change and free trade will \r\ntherefore be at the heart of our future relations.\r\nAfrica is a continent of great challenges, but also \r\none of equally great opportunities. Instability in Libya \r\nhas brought the world’s attention to the suffering caused \r\nby human smugglers and traffickers who take brutal \r\nadvantage of people and weaken the States in which they \r\noperate. The Security Council named some of the worst \r\nviolators in June. They and those like them should be \r\nsanctioned, apprehended and brought to justice. In the \r\nmeantime, the European Union will work diligently and \r\nin good faith with our North African partners on search \r\nand rescue efforts in the Mediterranean. Only collective \r\nresponsibility can offer effective solutions to global \r\nproblems such as migration and forced displacement. I \r\ntruly hope that the recent United Nations debates on the \r\nfuture management of migration and refugee protection \r\nrepresent a step in the right direction.\r\nThe European Union leads global resettlement \r\nefforts, including resettlements from Turkey, which, \r\nalong with Jordan and Lebanon, is hosting refugees \r\nwho have been displaced by the fighting in Syria. The \r\nSyrian people are suffering as the war continues. The \r\nmemorandum of understanding on Idlib must be fully \r\nimplemented in order to help to avoid a humanitarian \r\ncatastrophe. All parties must respect international \r\nhumanitarian law, ensure the protection of civilians and \r\nallow aid to reach those in need. A meaningful political \r\nprocess under the auspices of the United Nations is \r\nespecially needed in order to resolve the conflict.\r\nSustainable development and increasing \r\nintercontinental connectivity will bring countries, \r\npeople and societies closer together. Those priorities \r\nwill be crucial in our future relations with Africa and \r\nalso at next month’s Asia-Europe Meeting, which I will \r\nbe hosting in Brussels. They go hand in hand with the \r\nimplementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange and other international commitments. From \r\nfloods to fires, the impact of climate change becomes \r\nmore visible every year, and sadly, we now measure \r\nthe impact by the loss of human life. Although only \r\nslow progress is being made on our main task, which \r\nis implementing the Paris Agreement, the European \r\nUnion remains fully committed to it and has set it as a \r\npriority in its relations with our partners.\r\nOn the subject of the environment, I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to appeal to all leaders to \r\ntake action in order to protect the waters around the \r\nAntarctic. There is still time to save the natural habitat \r\nof many endangered species by establishing maritime \r\nsanctuaries in the Southern Ocean. Let me say it loud \r\nand clear. Those who can imagine our planet without \r\nwhales, penguins and other species will also have to \r\nimagine our planet without humans.\r\nNon-proliferation is another global challenge we \r\nface, but there the situation is looking better, thanks to \r\nmultilateral action on sanctions. A year ago, the situation \r\non the Korean peninsula was critical. Although much \r\ndepends on the attitude of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, we have seen that diplomacy can \r\nopen the way to more comprehensive solutions. A \r\nsimilar situation exists with Iran with regard to the \r\nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action. While addressing \r\nnuclear issues, that deal has also helped to create space \r\nfor dialogue on other matters of concern, such as Iran’s \r\nregional behaviour and ballistic-missile programmes. \r\nThe agreement is good for European, regional and \r\nglobal security. That is why the European Union is \r\ncommitted to maintaining it as long as Iran remains \r\nfully committed to it.\r\nI have mentioned the anniversary of Nelson \r\nMandela’s 100th birthday. In the next few hours, \r\nwe will also celebrate the seventy-fifth birthday of \r\nanother Nobel Peace Prize winner, a great Pole named \r\nLech Wałęsa. Both men are symbols of a beautiful \r\ncause — how to win without violence, forgive our \r\noppressors and overcome evil with good in public \r\nlife. Today, when so many people — including some \r\nhere in this Hall, and even the most powerful of \r\nworld leaders — are starting to give up on freedom, \r\nsolidarity and democracy, let us remember Mandela’s \r\nand Wałęsa’s message. Regardless ofhow difficult their \r\nsituation was, they never capitulated in their fight.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the European \r\nCouncil for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Donald Tusk, President of the European \r\nCouncil, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Charles Michel, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Belgium\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Belgium.\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 33/59\r\nMr. Charles Michel, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Belgium, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Charles Michel, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Belgium, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Michel (Belgium) (spoke in French): “The \r\nonly route that offers any hope of a better future for all \r\nhumanity is that of cooperation and partnership” (A/56/\r\nPV.7, p. 2). Those were words spoken from this rostrum \r\nby the late Kofi Annan 17 years ago, at the dawn of the \r\ntwenty-first century. This year, we commemorate the \r\ncentenary of the end of the First World War. Exacerbated \r\nrivalries, economic tensions and vengeful withdrawals \r\nled to misunderstanding, frustration and hard facts on \r\nthe ground. Unilateral actions and failed dialogue led to \r\nthe irreparable wiping out of sacrificed generations, as \r\nhalf of the twentieth century was crushed by the horror \r\nof two world wars and the shame of the Holocaust.\r\nIt took the foresight and courage of a generation \r\nto provide the outline of an international order based \r\non values  and rules. From the ashes of tragedy in the \r\nprevious century, the birth of the European Union and the \r\nUnited Nations has created hope for a better world. The \r\nEuropean Union has enjoyed a period of unprecedented \r\npeace and prosperity. Its concrete achievements include \r\na free economy based on fair competition, freedom \r\nof movement and the establishment of social and \r\nenvironmental standards.\r\nThe European Union is the result of a tireless \r\ndialogue that is sometimes complex and often \r\nrestrictive. That dialogue is based on an ambition that \r\ngoes far beyond simply adding to national interests. That \r\nambition is the promise of the founding fathers, namely, \r\nthe freedom and dignity of every citizen, the rule of \r\nlaw and democracy as a bulwark against arbitrariness \r\nin governance. Those are the pillars that have laid the \r\nfoundations for peace and security. The Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations declares the importance of dignity and \r\nrespect for every human being, regardless of where \r\nthey come from, the colour of their skin, their origin, \r\nphilosophical or religious beliefs or sexual orientation. \r\nOur universal values are the strongest and most reliable \r\nbenchmark for addressing each of the challenges that \r\nthe world faces.\r\nDemocracy and the rule of law are always the best \r\nguarantees of the realization of fundamental rights \r\nand freedoms, because the rule of law is the arbiter \r\nthat protects the weak from the strong. The rule of law \r\nmeans that we assume the consequences of our actions. \r\nThe rule of law is the rejection of impunity. The rule of \r\nlaw is also the guarantee that science and knowledge \r\nare better shared among us. Putting human beings at \r\nthe centre and establishing the rule of law as the basis \r\nfor international order is what should drive the engine \r\nof multilateralism.\r\nMultilateralism is not a hollow and meaningless \r\nconcept. On the contrary, it is a conviction, because \r\ndialogue is tireless, including with those with whom \r\nwe do not easily share the same points of view. That \r\ndialogue is key. Multilateralism is cooperation and \r\nnegotiation; it is the battle of ideas and arguments \r\nrather than weapons. Multilateralism is the rejection of \r\nviolence. It is up to us to be committed to a better, more \r\njust, safer and more sustainable world.\r\nWho here believes that bringing together the 193 \r\nnational sovereignties represented in this Organization \r\nwith each acting unilaterally could miraculously \r\nproduce a virtuous and effective response to our \r\ncommon challenges? That is an illusion. It is the same \r\nillusion as thinking that the invisible hand of the market \r\ncan naturally and miraculously lead to progress and \r\nshared well-being. Capitalism needs rules, and so does \r\nhumankind. Of course multilateralism requires patient \r\nefforts. Of course there may be failures. However, \r\nmultilateralism is the only way to eradicate poverty, \r\nneutralize terrorists and preserve the natural resources \r\nof our planet. My country regrets that international \r\nagreements, the result of tough and intense negotiations, \r\ncan be swiftly and unilaterally jettisoned. In just \r\na few months, the nuclear agreement with Iran, as \r\nwell as trade agreements and the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change, have all been cast aside by one of the \r\nsignatory parties.\r\nTrust and cooperation between sovereign nations \r\nimplies respect for the promises and commitments \r\nthat have been made. History has always shown that \r\nthe law of the survival of the fittest does not protect \r\nanyone; quite the opposite. The most lasting solutions \r\nare always those that are balanced and widely accepted. \r\nAs we know, Iran was on the brink of acquiring \r\nnuclear weapons and, as we know, the negotiations \r\non the problem were long and difficult in reaching a \r\ncompromise. It took reciprocal courage to overcome \r\ndeep mistrust and hostility, and we know that the \r\nagreement is not perfect, given that it does not cover \r\nIran’s ballistic programme. At the same time, the \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n34/59 18-30067\r\ninspections conducted by the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency confirm that Iran has been fulfilling its \r\ncommitments. Should the agreement be thrown aside \r\nowing to its imperfection? Should we not open a new \r\nchapter of multilateral negotiations to complement and \r\nimprove that agreement?\r\nUnilateral, brutal and unpredictable actions make \r\nthe world more dangerous. They result in imbalance and \r\nfrustration and serve as seeds of conflict. On the other \r\nhand, we are made stronger by dialogue and negotiation \r\nwith mutual respect. Dialogue helps us to deal with and \r\nresolve our disagreements and offers better results. For \r\n70 years, the United Nations has persistently worked \r\nto improve the world, based on a common foundation \r\nof fundamental values. It is our duty to identify the \r\nchallenges, develop strategies and, especially, to act. \r\nOur Organization has immeasurable potential, and in \r\nthat connection I would like to commend the intelligent, \r\nenergetic and tireless work of Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres.\r\nThroughout its history, my country has been \r\ncommitted to working for peace and building consensus. \r\nIn that strong conviction, Belgium has been elected as a \r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council for the \r\nnext two years. We will live up to the confidence placed \r\nin us. We will ensure that we foster dialogue with all \r\nactors. We want to promote a respectful and transparent \r\ndebate so as to inspire a greater spirit of trust among \r\nus. We will work for security, prosperity and respect \r\nfor our planet.\r\nCollective security is the ultimate requirement, \r\nand it is just common sense to seek to prevent conflict \r\nwhenever possible. That is why we support the \r\npermanent monitoring of all indicators of violence. \r\nWe are also in favour of setting up early-warning \r\nmechanisms, because serious violations of human rights \r\nshould never leave us indifferent. The manipulation or \r\nrigging of elections, violations of territorial integrity \r\nand threats of the use of force are always early-warning \r\nsigns of future conflict. The search for a peaceful and \r\npolitical solution must always be at the heart of our \r\napproach, and peacekeeping operations must always be \r\npart of a credible political framework.\r\nFinally, let us be honest with each other. The \r\npresence of Blue Helmets on the ground must not \r\nbecome a smokescreen for political resignation, either \r\nin conflict zones or at the regional or international \r\nlevel. Every peace mission must be regularly evaluated \r\nagainst the yardstick of its contribution to realizing the \r\npolitical goal in the noble sense of that term. During our \r\ntime as a member of the Security Council, we would \r\nalso like to focus on protecting the most vulnerable in \r\narmed conflicts. In our view, the protection of civilians, \r\nespecially children, as well as ensuring dignity and \r\nrespect for women and the safety of schools, hospitals \r\nand humanitarian channels, are the essential priorities. \r\nWe cannot tolerate the intolerable. Those who flout, \r\noften cynically, those fundamental principles of \r\ninternational humanitarian law must be punished. The \r\nfight against impunity must also seek to create the \r\nconditions for living together in peace after the conflict. \r\nLiving together in peace and harmony is an existential \r\nissue in the Near East and Middle East. The tragedies \r\nthat we are witnessing in Syria, Libya and Yemen \r\nremind us of the long road still to be travelled. We \r\ncannot allow regions to become arenas for the cruel and \r\ndeplorable battles of warring nations, with no regard \r\nfor the humanitarian tragedies that subsequently ensue.\r\nTwenty-five years after the signing of the Oslo \r\nAccords, the peace process in the Middle East remains \r\nat a standstill. The excitement generated by some \r\ndevelopments, which often contradict international law, \r\nonly creates further obstacles and difficulties and dims \r\nhopes for peace. We maintain our support for the two-\r\nState solution, with the two States living side-by-side in \r\npeace and security, with Jerusalem as a shared capital.\r\nThe proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons \r\nand weapons of mass destruction poses a serious threat \r\nto the future of humankind. We will remain fully \r\nengaged in non-proliferation efforts.\r\nWe want a more prosperous world, with more shared \r\ndevelopment and the freedom to be entrepreneurial \r\nand to innovate, create and trade. The development \r\nof science and knowledge and the rejection of \r\nobscurantism are always the basis for development \r\nand the improvement of living conditions. The digital \r\neconomy and the artificial-intelligence revolution bring \r\nwith them fears and uncertainties, but above all they \r\noffer new opportunities for a better world, if those \r\nadvances are designed to serve everyone.\r\nWe must also ensure that we, always and \r\neverywhere, encourage efforts to promote good \r\ngovernance, transparency and the fight against \r\ncorruption. For centuries, trade has promoted peace \r\namong peoples. Trade develops mutual understanding, \r\nrespect for cultures and traditions, sharing and the \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 35/59\r\nexchange of experiences. Trade leads to prosperity. \r\nProsperity leads to peace. Freedom of trade must be \r\nbased on healthy and fair competition and a shared \r\nlevel playing field, with ambitious and reciprocal \r\nsocial and environmental standards. In that respect, \r\nthe recent trade agreement between the European \r\nUnion and Canada, concluded despite much resistance, \r\nincluding in my own country, offers such guarantees. I \r\nam delighted with the impressive and rapidly achieved \r\nresults, with jobs and investment at its heart, leading \r\nto better social protection and therefore more freedom.\r\nBefore 2050, the African continent is expected to \r\nhave a population of 2.5 billion. One in four human \r\nbeings will therefore be African. For a long time, my \r\ncountry has been advocating for a new, more global, \r\ndynamic and ambitious partnership with the African \r\ncontinent. We know how much potential there is in \r\nAfrica. Energy, agriculture, infrastructure and digital \r\ntechnology offer areas of opportunity for the future. I \r\nwant to make a strong appeal here for a sacred Africa-\r\nEurope alliance — a strong and sustainable alliance for \r\nthe development of both continents in the service of our \r\npeoples, an alliance for investment, trade and jobs in \r\nAfrica and Europe.\r\nI say to our African friends that it is up to us, that \r\nwe should turn the page on the antagonisms of the past. \r\nLet us heal ancient wounds. Let us forge a partnership \r\nfree of nostalgia or guilt. And above all, let us dare to \r\nrenounce charity, which eases the conscience but also \r\nentails a dose of humiliation. Let us draw up a peer-\r\nto-peer strategy based on the shared values of the rule \r\nof law, democracy and respect for our fellow citizens. \r\nIn ten years, we can, if we wish, build an unequalled \r\nand unprecedented area of prosperity. I advocate a \r\nvery ambitious free-trade agreement, from continent \r\nto continent, a global and reciprocal partnership, a \r\nwin-win situation for all.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development sets \r\nout the path for a better and fairer world, and everything \r\nis there — poverty eradication, access to health and \r\neducation, gender equality and the fight against global \r\nwarming. The only possible option is the general \r\nmobilization and ownership of this joint programme. \r\nAll of us, at all levels, let us roll up our sleeves, decide \r\nand act, because the countdown is on. There is urgency \r\nabout this, and the results are fundamental.\r\nClimate change is not constrained by borders. \r\nNatural resources are limited and the number of people \r\non Earth is constantly increasing. The stubbornness of \r\nsome in denying the reality of climate change is of the \r\nsame order as the stubbornness of those who in the past \r\ndenied that the Earth was round. Prosperity must be \r\nsustainable. It can no longer be based on a frenetic and \r\nselfish exploitation of our precious natural resources. \r\nOceans, biodiversity, air quality and health are precious \r\nassets that must be cherished and respected.\r\nNatural disasters are falling on us one after another \r\nand are ever more spectacular, ever more deadly. Just a \r\nfew weeks ago in India, in Kerala, unprecedented f loods \r\nforever shattered the fate of 450 people, displacing a \r\nmillion others who had been displaced and are now \r\nhomeless. The harmful effects of climate change are \r\ngoing to cause or aggravate conflicts. In West Africa, \r\nfor example, access to water is leading to increasing \r\ntensions between herders and farmers, with the risk of \r\nescalation on the basis of ethnicity and identity. Faced \r\nwith that existential challenge for our children, our \r\nresponsibility is shared. Alone, we can do nothing. \r\nTogether, we can do anything.\r\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change must \r\nbe implemented. We must, of course, give up certain \r\nhabits. We need to change our behaviours. But it will \r\nbe worth doing, because the future of humankind is at \r\nstake here.\r\nThroughout history, human beings have always \r\nmigrated. Our host country here is a great example. \r\nMen and women from elsewhere, seeking to discover \r\na new world, have built a free and prosperous \r\nnation. This year, we recorded the highest number of \r\nmigrations ever. It is not a question of being for or \r\nagainst an unavoidable phenomenon. The issue is about \r\nwhether we can manage it in an orderly way so as to \r\nreduce fears, tensions and conflicts. We must first pull \r\nmigration out of the claws of smugglers and traffickers \r\nin human beings, the abject slavers of modern times. \r\nWe must also reject the trap of deliberate confusion \r\nfomented by populists on all sides, whether from the \r\nfar left or the far right.\r\nMy country intends to continue to fully assume \r\nits responsibility to humankind. During the past three \r\nyears, we have granted international protection to \r\nnearly 45,000 people, and that is many more than in the \r\npast. I am also in favour of an effective policy of return \r\nfor those who do not meet the conditions set forth at the \r\ninternational level.\r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n36/59 18-30067\r\nFinally, it needs to be said that the time has come \r\nto pursue legal and orderly forms of international \r\nmobility, for example, to enable students to get an \r\neducation and then return home, or for other economic \r\nreasons. In December, in Marrakech, my country \r\nwill sign the global pact on migration, because that \r\ndocument is a step in the right direction. It clarifies \r\nthe various concepts and could be a lever for the future \r\nand for a more organized and controlled management \r\nof international mobility. Indeed, we can say that \r\nextremists on all sides and human traffickers are in \r\nthe same boat. The former instrumentalize and fuel the \r\nmigration issue for electoral and political purposes, the \r\nlatter for low financial purposes.\r\nIn conclusion, peace is our most precious asset. \r\nHistory has always shown that peace requires courage \r\nand vigilance at all times, and that no continent or \r\ncountry is immune to the poison of the fear of others, \r\nor of hatred or selfishness. We all come from different \r\nbackgrounds, with our histories, our cultures, our \r\ntraditions, but also with our emotions, which stem \r\nfrom the roots of our past. The demands of memory \r\nmust serve our lucidity. The demands of memory must \r\nrally our energy so that it can rise to the challenges \r\nof this century. Those challenges know no borders. \r\nDevelopment, the fight against terrorism, climate \r\nchange, are all problems that no country, regardless of \r\nits economic or political power, will be able to overcome \r\nby itself.\r\nBeyond our many differences, we will always share \r\na common feature, our humanity. Every human being, \r\nby the simple fact of his or her birth, must be free. That \r\nbeing’s dignity must be recognized and respected. It is a \r\npivotal value, and the fundamental condition for making \r\nthe world progress unflaggingly towards greater hope \r\nand optimism. Our method is based on our faith in a \r\ncommitted, creative, invigorating multilateralism. We \r\nreject all forms of inertia and resignation, because we \r\nbelieve that the best is within us.\r\n“Law and order rather than violence; tolerance rather \r\nthan selfishness; knowledge rather than obscurantism; \r\nrespect for others rather than hatred or fear”: that is my \r\ncountry’s credo. Belgium is a loyal, solid and reliable \r\npartner. We will spare no effort to make the world a \r\nsafer, more sustainable and, above all, more just place.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Belgium for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Charles Michel, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Belgium, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister \r\nfor the Economy, Minister for Communications, \r\nand Minister for Regional Cooperation of the \r\nState of Israel\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, Minister for the Economy, Minister \r\nfor Communications, and Minister for Regional \r\nCooperation of the State of Israel.\r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Minister for the Economy, \r\nMinister for Communications, and Minister for \r\nRegional Cooperation of the State of Israel, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, \r\nPrime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister \r\nfor the Economy, Minister for Communications, and \r\nMinister for Regional Cooperation of the State of Israel, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Netanyahu (Israel): When I spoke here three \r\nyears ago (see A/70/PV.22), Israel stood alone among \r\nthe nations. Of the nearly 200 countries that sit in this \r\nHall, only Israel openly opposed the nuclear deal with \r\nIran. We opposed it because it threatens our future, \r\neven our very survival. We opposed it because the deal \r\npaved Iran’s path to a nuclear arsenal. By lifting the \r\nsanctions, it has fuelled Iran’s campaign of carnage and \r\nconquest throughout the Middle East. We opposed it \r\nbecause the deal was based on a fundamental lie, that \r\nIran is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons.\r\nIsrael exposed that lie earlier this year. In February \r\n2018, Israel conducted a daring raid on Iran’s secret \r\natomic archive. We obtained more than 100,000 \r\ndocuments and videos that had been stashed in vaults in \r\nan innocent-looking building in the heart of Tehran. In \r\nMay, I presented a short summary of what we obtained \r\nto the international media. I provided hard evidence of \r\nIran’s plans to build nuclear weapons and its plans to \r\ndeceive the international community. Israel shared that \r\ninformation and even more damning evidence that we \r\nfound with members of the five plus one group and with \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 37/59\r\nMonths have passed, and the IAEA has still not \r\ntaken any action. It has not posed a single question to \r\nIran. It has not demanded to inspect a single new site \r\ndiscovered in that secret archive. Given that inaction, \r\nI have decided, therefore, to reveal today something \r\nelse that we have shared with the IAEA and with a few \r\nintelligence agencies. What I am about to say has not \r\nbeen shared publicly before. Today I am disclosing for \r\nthe first time that Iran has another secret facility in \r\nTehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive \r\namounts of equipment and materiel from Iran’s secret \r\nnuclear-weapon programme.\r\nIn May, we exposed the site of Iran’s secret atomic \r\narchive. It is in the Shorabad district of Tehran. Today \r\nI am revealing the site of a second facility, Iran’s secret \r\natomic warehouse, which is located in the Torquzabad \r\ndistrict of Tehran, just three miles away from the \r\narchive. Let me show exactly what the secret atomic \r\nwarehouse looks like. From this image, it looks just \r\nlike the atomic archive, another innocent-looking \r\ncompound. For listeners at home using Google Earth, \r\nthis no-longer-secret atomic warehouse is on Mehr \r\nAlley. The coordinates are on the image. Anyone can \r\ntry to get there. And for those who try to get there, it \r\nis a hundred meters from the Kalishoi, a rug-cleaning \r\noperation. By the way, I hear they do a fantastic job of \r\ncleaning rugs there. But by now they may be radioactive \r\nrags. That is the second secret site.\r\nNow countries with satellite capabilities may notice \r\nsome increased activity on Mehr Alley in the days and \r\nweeks ahead. The people they will see scurrying back \r\nand forth are Iranian officials desperately trying to \r\nfinish the job of cleaning up that site. Since we raided \r\nthe atomic archive, they have been busy cleaning out \r\nthe atomic warehouse. Just last month, they removed \r\n15 kilogrammes of radioactive materiel. What did they \r\ndo with it? They had to get those 15 kilogrammes of \r\nradioactive materiel out of the site, so they took it out \r\nand spread it around Tehran in an effort to hide the \r\nevidence. The residents of Tehran, now endangered, \r\nmay want to know that they can get a Geiger counter on \r\nAmazon for only $29.99. At today’s exchange rate, that \r\nis just 4 million Iranian rials. But we will get to that \r\nlater. I will talk about the Iranian economy in a minute.\r\nThey took that radioactive material and spread it \r\naround Tehran. The Iranian officials cleaning out the \r\nsite still have a lot of work to do, because they had at \r\nleast 15 gigantic ship containers full of nuclear-related \r\nequipment and materiel stored there. Since each of \r\nthose containers can hold 20 tons of materiel, the site \r\nmust have contained as much as 300 tons of nuclear-\r\nrelated equipment and materiel, all in that very place.\r\nWe now have to ask ourselves a question. Why did \r\nIran keep a secret atomic archive and a secret atomic \r\nwarehouse? After all, when South Africa and Libya \r\ngave up their nuclear programmes, the first thing they \r\ndid was to destroy both the archives and the materiel \r\nand equipment. The answer to the question is simple. \r\nThe reason Iran did not destroy its atomic archive and \r\nits atomic warehouse is because it has not abandoned \r\nits goal to develop nuclear weapons. In fact, it planned \r\nto use both of those sites in a few years when the time \r\nwas right to break out the atom bomb. Delegations may \r\nrest assured that that will not happen. It will not happen \r\nbecause what Iran hides Israel will find.\r\nI have a message for the Head of the IAEA, \r\nMr. Yukiya Amano. I believe he is a good man. I \r\nbelieve he wants to do the right thing. I therefore ask \r\nhim to do the right thing now. The IAEA should inspect \r\nthat atomic warehouse immediately, before the Iranians \r\nfinish clearing it out. Do delegations remember the time \r\nwhen we were promised that inspections could take \r\nplace anytime, anywhere? Well, how about inspections \r\nof Mehr Alley right now? And while Mr. Amano is at \r\nit, he should inspect the other sites that we told him \r\nabout. Once and for all, he should tell the world the \r\ntruth about Iran.\r\nI also have a message today for the tyrants of \r\nTehran. Israel knows what they are doing, and Israel \r\nknows where they are doing it. Israel will never let a \r\nregime that calls for our destruction develop nuclear \r\nweapons — not now, not in 10 years, not ever. And \r\nIsrael will do whatever it must do to defend itself against \r\nIran’s aggression. We will continue to act against it in \r\nSyria. We will act against it in Lebanon. We will act \r\nagainst it in Iraq. We will act against it whenever and \r\nwherever we must. We must act to defend our State and \r\nto defend our people.\r\nThree years ago, a few weeks after the nuclear deal \r\nwas completed, I asked this question from this very \r\npodium: does anyone seriously believe that f looding \r\nIran’s radical theocracy with weapons and cash will \r\ncurb its appetite for aggression? But many of the deal’s \r\nsupporters believed just that. They believed that Iran’s \r\nregime would become more moderate, more peaceful. \r\nThey believed that Iran would use the billions of dollars \r\nit received in sanctions relief to improve the lives of \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n38/59 18-30067\r\nits people — solving the water problem, the trucking \r\nproblem, the electricity problem and improving \r\nhospitals and schools. That is what they believed. \r\nPerhaps some people here today also believed that.\r\nWell, it did not happen. Instead, Iran used the \r\nmoney to fuel its vast war machine. Just this past year, \r\nIran has attacked Kurds in Iraq, slaughtered Sunnis in \r\nSyria, armed Hizbullah in Lebanon, financed Hamas in \r\nGaza, fired missiles into Saudi Arabia and threatened \r\nthe freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz \r\nand the Strait of Bab El-Mandeb. That is some peace, \r\nsome moderation.\r\nIf people think that Iran’s aggression has been \r\nconfined to the Middle East, they need to think \r\nagain. Last month, two Iranian agents were arrested \r\nfor plotting terror attacks here in the United States, \r\nand several weeks ago, Iranian agents were arrested \r\nfor plotting terror attacks in the heart of Europe. Yet \r\nwhile the United States is confronting Iran with new \r\nsanctions, Europe and others are appeasing Iran by \r\ntrying to help it bypass those new sanctions.\r\nNow, I have just used a tough word, a very \r\nstrong word: appeasement. I use it reluctantly. But \r\nunfortunately that is exactly what we are seeing again \r\nin Europe. We need to think about that. The same \r\nweek that Iran was caught red-handed trying to murder \r\nEuropean citizens, European leaders were rolling out \r\nthe red carpet for President Rouhani, promising to give \r\nIran even more money. As the son of a historian, I have \r\nto ask — and I ask it not merely as a historian’s son, \r\nbut as a Jew, a citizen of the world and someone who \r\nhas lived through the twentieth century — have these \r\nEuropean leaders learned nothing from history? Will \r\nthey ever wake up?\r\nWe in Israel do not need a wake-up call, because \r\nIran threatens us every day. Despite the best of \r\nhopes — and there were many hopes around the \r\nnuclear deal — that deal did not push war further away. \r\nIt brought it ever closer to our borders. In Syria, Iran \r\nis trying to establish permanent military bases against \r\nus and has already launched missiles and drones into \r\nour territory. In Gaza, Iran is arming terror groups to \r\nlaunch rocket attacks on our cities and terror attacks on \r\nour civilians. In Lebanon, Iran is directing Hizbullah \r\nin the building of secret sites for converting inaccurate \r\nprojectiles into precision-guided missiles that can hit \r\ntargets deep inside Israel with an accuracy of within \r\n10 metres.\r\nThe Assembly needs to listen to this. Hizbullah is \r\ndeliberately using the innocent people of Beirut as human \r\nshields. It has placed three of these missile-conversion \r\nsites alongside Beirut’s international airport. I can show \r\na picture that is worth a thousand missiles. In it, we can \r\nsee Beirut’s international airport, the first missile site, \r\nwhich is in the Ouzai neighbourhood, on the water’s \r\nedge, a few blocks away from the runway. There is also \r\na second site, which is underneath a soccer stadium, \r\ntwo blocks away, and a third site, which is adjacent to \r\nthe airport itself, right next to it.\r\nI therefore have a message for Hizbullah today. \r\nIsrael also knows what it is doing. Israel knows where \r\nit is doing it. And Israel will not let it get away with it. \r\nJust as supporters of the nuclear deal were wrong about \r\nwhat would happen when sanctions were removed, \r\nthey were dead wrong about what would happen when \r\nsanctions were restored. They argued that United States \r\nsanctions alone would have little economic impact on \r\nIran. That is what they said. It is hard to believe.\r\nLet us take a look at what has happened to \r\nIran’s economy now that President Trump has forced \r\ncompanies to choose between doing business with \r\nIran and doing business with the United States, whose \r\ngross domestic product is 50 times the size of Iran’s \r\ngross domestic product. A year ago, Iran’s economy \r\nwas booming. Now it is collapsing. Iran’s currency is \r\nplummeting. Inflation and unemployment are soaring. \r\nBritish airlines, German banks, French oil companies, \r\nJapanese oil importers and many others are scrambling \r\nto get out. If that is little economic impact, we can \r\nimagine what will happen with the next batch of United \r\nStates sanctions, which will be imposed in November.\r\nThe deal’s supporters were also wrong when they \r\nargued — and it is hard to believe that they argued this, \r\ndespite the fact that I have had many arguments with \r\nthem — that restoring sanctions would rally the Iranian \r\npeople around the regime. While they are definitely \r\nrallying, their rallying is definitely not around the \r\nregime. They are rallying against the regime. They are \r\nnot chanting “Death to America”. They are chanting \r\n“Death to the dictator”. They are not chanting “Export \r\nthe Islamic Revolution”. They are chanting “Leave \r\nSyria”, “Leave Lebanon”, “Leave Gaza”, and “Take \r\ncare of us in Iran”.\r\nI listen to those protests. I talk to Iranian people. I \r\nshow videos and get so many responses — from Iranians. \r\nAt first, I thought they were Iranian exiles — in the \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 39/59\r\nsafety of London or Paris or Los Angeles. No, these \r\nare Iranians from Iran, embracing Israel, criticizing \r\ntheir regime — that is an understatement — with their \r\nnames. Shortly after the protests broke out, I asked my \r\nintelligence people, “What is going on?”\r\nThose protests are an indicator of something \r\nextraordinary that has been taking place there. \r\nThrough those protests, the Iranian people are showing \r\nunbelievable courage. The protests are now embracing \r\nthe whole of Iran — from the urban centres to distant \r\nvillages, from the striking merchants in the bazaars to \r\nthe young women uncovering their hair. The people \r\nof Iran are bravely standing up to a regime that has \r\nbrutally repressed them for four decades and that has \r\nsquandered — and still squanders — their money in \r\nbloody wars across the Middle East.\r\nThis is what I say to Europe’s leaders and to \r\nothers. Instead of coddling Iran’s dictators, join the \r\nUnited States and Israel and most of the Arab world \r\nin supporting new sanctions against a regime that \r\nendangers all of us across the world.\r\nIsrael is deeply grateful to President Trump for his \r\nbold decision to withdraw from the disastrous nuclear \r\ndeal with Iran. A great many of our Arab neighbours \r\nare also grateful. And everyone who cares about the \r\npeace and security of the world should also be grateful.\r\nBut I have an important confession to make. It \r\nmay be surprising, but I have to admit that the Iran \r\ndeal has had one positive consequence, an unintended \r\nbut positive consequence. By empowering Iran, it has \r\nbrought Israel and many Arab States closer than they \r\nhave ever been before, in an intimacy and friendship \r\nthat I have not seen in my lifetime and that would have \r\nbeen unimaginable a few years ago.\r\nWhen friendships are formed around a threat or a \r\nchallenge, opportunities are quickly seen, not just for \r\nsecurity but for how to bring a better life to our peoples, \r\nwhich is what Israel can and wants to contribute to. \r\nIsrael deeply values those new friendships, and I hope \r\nthe day will soon arrive when Israel will be able to \r\nexpand peace, a formal peace, beyond Egypt and Jordan \r\nto other Arab neighbours, including the Palestinians. I \r\nlook forward to working with President Trump and his \r\npeace team to achieve that goal.\r\nI also want to take the opportunity now, here at \r\nthe United Nations, a place I know something about \r\nbecause many years ago I served here as Ambassador \r\nfor many years, to express Israel’s appreciation to \r\nPresident Trump and Ambassador Haley for the \r\nunwavering support they have provided to Israel at \r\nthe United Nations. They have unequivocally backed \r\nIsrael’s right to defend itself. They rightly pulled out \r\nof a history-denying UNESCO and a morally bankrupt \r\nHuman Rights Council. I think that more resolutions \r\nabout Israel than about the rest of the world combined \r\nhave been introduced in those bodies, and tenfold the \r\nnumber of resolutions on Iran, Syria or any other State. \r\nIt is not even fair to say “tenfold”, because there are no \r\nmultiples of zero.\r\nPresident Trump and Ambassador Haley also \r\nstopped funding an unreformed United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \r\nEast, an organization that perpetuates the Palestinian \r\nrefugee problem instead of solving it. Day after day, the \r\nTrump Administration has stood up to what has long \r\nbeen a specialty here at the United Nations, slandering \r\nIsrael. Even though the shameful resolution 3379 \r\n(XXX) comparing Zionism to racism was repealed 25 \r\nyears ago, I am sorry to say that its foul stench still \r\nclings to these halls.\r\nIsrael airlifted Ethiopian Jews to freedom and a \r\nnew life in Israel, in the Jewish State. Yet here at the \r\nUnited Nations Israel is absurdly accused of racism. \r\nIsrael’s Arab citizens vote in our elections, serve in our \r\nParliament, preside over our courts and have exactly \r\nthe same individual rights as all other Israeli citizens. \r\nYet here at the United Nations Israel is shamefully \r\naccused of apartheid. Today there are at least five times \r\nas many Palestinians as there were in 1948, the year of \r\nIsrael’s founding. Yet here at the United Nations Israel \r\nis outrageously accused of ethnic cleansing. Do those \r\nhere know what that is? It is the same old anti-Semitism \r\nwith a brand-new face. That is all it is.\r\nOnce it was the Jewish people who were slandered \r\nand held to a different standard; today it is the Jewish \r\nState that is slandered and held to a different standard. \r\nHere is an example. Take the outlandish attacks that \r\nhave been levelled against Israel after our Knesset, our \r\nParliament, recently adopted a law declaring Israel the \r\nnation-State of the Jewish people. Nevertheless, Israel \r\nis a free country. People can oppose that law, and people \r\nhave done so. People can call for different wording in \r\nthis or that clause, or add or delete a clause. People can \r\ndo that.\r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n40/59 18-30067\r\nBut when Israel is called racist for making \r\nHebrew its official language and the Star of David \r\nits national f lag, when Israel is labelled an apartheid \r\nState for declaring itself the nation-State of the Jewish \r\npeople — that is downright preposterous. And does the \r\nAssembly know why? Because represented in the Hall \r\ntoday are more than 100 countries that have only one \r\nofficial language, even though many other languages \r\nare commonly spoken within those countries. There \r\nare more than 50 countries here that have crosses or \r\ncrescents on their f lags, even though they have many \r\nnon-Muslims and non-Christians living in their \r\nmidst. And there are dozens of countries that define \r\nthemselves as nation-States of a particular people, even \r\nthough there are many ethnic and national minorities \r\nwithin their borders. None of those countries have \r\nbeen denigrated or libelled for celebrating their unique \r\nnational identity. Only Israel is denigrated. Only Israel \r\nis libelled. What is unique about the Jewish people is \r\nnot that we have a nation-State. What is unique is that \r\nmany still oppose our having a nation-State.\r\nMoments ago, President Abbas outrageously said \r\nthat Israel’s nation-State law proves that Israel is a \r\nracist, apartheid State. President Abbas should know \r\nbetter. He wrote a dissertation denying the Holocaust. \r\nHis Palestinian National Authority imposes death \r\nsentences on Palestinians for selling land to Jews. Let \r\nme repeat that. If a Jew buys an apartment or a piece \r\nof land anywhere in the Palestinian territories, the \r\nPalestinian who sold him that land is executed. That \r\nis what the law says. President Abbas proudly pays \r\nPalestinian terrorists who murder Jews. In fact, the \r\nmore they slay, the more he pays. That is in their law \r\ntoo. Then how can he condemn Israel’s morality and \r\ncall Israel racist?\r\nThat is not the way to peace. That is not the way \r\nto achieve the peace that we all want and need and to \r\nwhich Israel remains committed. This body should not \r\nbe applauding the Head of a regime that pays terrorists. \r\nThe United Nations should condemn such a despicable \r\npolicy. And the United Nations, which brokered an \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian ceasefire in 2014, should demand \r\nthat Hamas release our fallen soldiers Oron Shaul and \r\nHadar Goldin. The latter was kidnapped when Hamas \r\nviolated that very ceasefire. Hamas should also release \r\nthe two Israeli citizens whom it holds captive, Avera \r\nMengistu and Hisham Al-Sayed.\r\nEvery time I stand here I feel as I do today. I \r\nam privileged to stand here as the Prime Minister \r\nof the State of Israel, a Jewish and democratic State. \r\nSome believe that Israel cannot be both Jewish and \r\ndemocratic. That is false. Israel is both, and Israel will \r\nalways remain both. Ever since Abraham and Sarah \r\nmade their journey to the promised land, nearly 4,000 \r\nyears ago, the land of Israel has been our homeland. \r\nIt is the place where Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob, Leah \r\nand Rachel carried out their eternal covenant with \r\nGod. It is where Joshua made us a sovereign nation, \r\nwhere David ruled and Isaiah preached, where the \r\nMaccabees fought and where Masada fell. It is the place \r\nfrom which we were exiled and to which we returned, \r\nrebuilding our ancient and eternal capital, Jerusalem. \r\nThe nation-State of Israel is the only place where the \r\nJewish people proudly exercise our collective right of \r\nself-determination. That right was recognized nearly a \r\ncentury ago by the League of Nations, and more than 70 \r\nyears ago by the United Nations when it supported the \r\nestablishment of a Jewish State. That is what resolution \r\n181 (II) said, “a Jewish State”.\r\nAt the same time, Israel is a vibrant democracy, \r\nwhere all its citizens, Jews and non-Jews alike, enjoy \r\nequal individual rights, and those rights are guaranteed \r\nby law. In Israel, whether a person is a Jew or an \r\nArab, a Christian or a Muslim, a Druze or a Bedouin \r\nor anything else, that person’s individual rights are \r\nexactly the same and will always remain the same. \r\nIn the Middle East that is not obvious. Now that is an \r\nunderstatement. In the Middle East, where women are \r\noften treated as property, minorities are persecuted and \r\ngays are hanged, Israel stands out as a shining example \r\nof freedom and progress.\r\nI could not be more proud to represent my country, \r\nIsrael. I am proud that we have made Israel a global \r\ntechnological Power of breathtaking creativity in \r\ninformation technology and precision agriculture. Is \r\nthe Assembly aware that we target the fertilizer and the \r\nwater down to the individual plant — not to a field, \r\nnot to part of a field, but down to the plant? I am proud \r\nof those geniuses that have brought those unbelievable \r\ndevelopments in water management, cybersecurity, \r\nautonomous vehicles, digital health, medical devices \r\nand so many other fields that are improving the lives of \r\nbillions of people around the world. I am proud of Israel’s \r\nbrilliant scholars, innovative entrepreneurs, talented \r\nartists, devoted teachers and compassionate doctors, \r\nand of our search-and-rescue teams who save lives \r\nfrom Haiti to Mexico, from Nepal to the Philippines. I \r\nam also proud of Israel’s courageous soldiers, the men \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 41/59\r\nand women who bravely defend our homeland while \r\nupholding the highest values. Most of all, I am proud of \r\nthe people of Israel, who draw extraordinary strength \r\nfrom the deep wellsprings of our heritage, who possess \r\nan unbreakable spirit and who are as determined as \r\never to build a secure and magnificent future for the \r\none and only Jewish State.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Malta\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Malta.\r\nMr. Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Malta, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Joseph Muscat, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Malta, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Muscat (Malta): This summer we lost a great \r\nman, Kofi Annan. He stood for the need for Member \r\nStates to be united in our approach if we wish to achieve \r\nthe goals of the United Nations. That is why I am here \r\naddressing the General Assembly today, because I \r\nbelieve that global problems require global solutions. \r\nAdvocating a global approach does not mean loving \r\nyour country less than others. It means that working \r\ntogether makes it less likely that a might-is-right \r\ndoctrine will prevail. Furthermore, better solutions can \r\nbe found together, rather than alone.\r\nIn order to find solutions we must remain \r\ncommitted to communicating and understanding one \r\nanother. Whatever challenges we need to address and \r\nhowever different each nation’s views and perspectives \r\nare, we have a better chance at solving them as a \r\nunited force, rather than divided or on our own. Malta, \r\nbeing a member of both the European Union and the \r\nCommonwealth, knows only too well that no single \r\nnation, big or small, can tackle global problems alone.\r\nThe trend of nations drifting towards reactions \r\nbased only on their own borders is a worrying one. Some, \r\nunfortunately, are wanting to solve global issues with \r\nlocal solutions, which, as many here recognize, can at \r\nbest give the illusion of working for a limited period of \r\ntime, and at worst lead to almost immediate implosion.\r\nWe must, of course, respect the sovereignty of all \r\nnations, and we have no right to stand here before the \r\nAssembly hoping to judge others. But those who are \r\nclosing themselves off from debate believe falsely that \r\nthey can escape certain issues. We are seeing divisions \r\nnot just among global leaders or nations, but within our \r\nown societies, neighbourhoods and even families. Local \r\nsolutions breed global problems, which then manifest \r\nthemselves with devastating results, from the use of \r\nplastic products that are polluting our seas to the point \r\nthat they are killing our sea life, to mass migrations \r\nand the effect of displacement on both migrants and \r\nhost societies, where there are vulnerable people on \r\nboth sides.\r\nI mention those examples because both of them have \r\nhit us particularly hard in Malta and in the Mediterranean \r\nSea. The latter is visible to all. We are in the centre of the \r\nMediterranean Sea, in the middle of the route between \r\nNorth Africa, Libya and mainland Europe, the centre of \r\na journey that thousands of people have undertaken in \r\nrecent years. We have been grappling with complexities \r\nthat have existed for years — much longer than has \r\nbeen recognized on a priority basis by the international \r\ncommunity — and that have dominated media headlines \r\nin Europe and beyond. Although crossings through the \r\ncentral Mediterranean have decreased in the past year, \r\nthe concerns of our populations have grown. And many \r\nfeel the international community has failed to provide \r\nsolutions for them. That has given rise to movements \r\nthat preach simplistic solutions to complex problems.\r\nWhat can surely be stopped, if we have a unified \r\napproach, are the criminal gangs profiting from \r\nsmuggling human beings. With a global strategy \r\nthat can deliver incisive blows to migrant smugglers, \r\nwe can disrupt their online recruitment efforts, their \r\npayment methods and their supply of sea vessels. Most \r\nimportant, working together, we can stop the people \r\nprofiting from a practice that has often resulted in the \r\ndeaths of so many innocent people.\r\nMalta is a small State that has one of the highest \r\nrates of economic growth in Europe and in the world, \r\nbut that also ranks among the highest worldwide in \r\nterms of the number of asylum applications per capita. \r\nDespite that, our humanitarian response is still fully in \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n42/59 18-30067\r\nline with our international commitments. That is also \r\ntrue for Malta’s embarkation policy, which has been \r\nconsistent and clear. And we expect others, not only \r\nStates but also the non-State actors involved, to abide \r\nby international rules.\r\nIn recent weeks — because of the actions of a few \r\nwho have not abided by the relevant conventions — Malta \r\nhad to bring together like-minded nations with a \r\nhumanitarian conscience to offer a place of safety for \r\nstranded migrants. We had no legal obligation to do so, \r\nbut we did it in a spirit of seeking unified solutions. And \r\nit proved that when solidarity works, complex issues \r\ncan often have simple solutions. Although I am under \r\nno illusion and know that this was just a temporary \r\nrespite in a much bigger problem, such actions could \r\nprovide a foundation for long-term solutions, if all \r\nEuropean Union member States could come together \r\nin a solution resembling a Bretton Woods-style \r\ninstitutional arrangement for addressing and managing \r\nmigration with international support.\r\nThe soon to be adopted global compact on \r\nmigration, which aims to establish a new global \r\nmigration governance architecture on the principle of \r\nshared international responsibilities and solidarity, is a \r\nwelcome move in the right direction. But it is a milestone \r\non the road rather than the end of the road. We must \r\nnow walk the talk by engaging in operational action.\r\nNarratives that use inflated or false facts and \r\nthrive on a nation’s fear of openness have led to painful \r\noutcomes in history, not only producing the obvious \r\neffects but also affecting the dynamics of international \r\nrelationships, which overflow into other issues with \r\ndevastating results. The current surge in nationalism \r\nand tighter border controls threatens to do just that, \r\nwith the potential for obstructing democratic decisions \r\nfuelling extremism of all kinds.\r\nHowever, let us take some comfort in knowing that \r\nin the 73 years of the existence of the United Nations, \r\nthe going has always been tough. In fact, those who \r\nhave stood where I am standing today have faced \r\nmuch worse crises, from wars and famines to injustice \r\nand killer diseases. But through unified approaches, \r\nsolutions were found and nations survived. Each time \r\nwe came together we emerged stronger as an institution, \r\nas a global community. We currently live in a world \r\nwith fewer wars and more dialogue and cooperation \r\nthan ever before.\r\nBut our work is not done, and it probably never \r\nwill be. Although fewer people live in extreme poverty, \r\nthat scourge has not been eradicated. We have found \r\nsolutions to many life-threatening diseases, yet cures \r\nare still needed for others. Injustice remains, and \r\nclimate change could be the greatest threat to life in our \r\nhistory. As we solve one issue, another replaces it. That \r\nis life. However, the important thing is that we continue \r\nto strive and work towards the greater good. But we can \r\nonly do that together.\r\nOne way forward that Malta advocates is the \r\nharnessing of new technologies, which offer endless \r\npossibilities. We are currently in exciting technological \r\ntimes. With the lightning pace of current technological \r\nadvances, each incredible piece of innovation could \r\nhold a new solution to problems that may have persisted \r\nfor decades — from advanced robotics and artificial \r\nintelligence to 3D printing and the Internet of things.\r\nClearly, the fast and obvious transition to the \r\ndigital economy and society poses challenges, which \r\nhave to do with the very nature of concepts that we \r\nbelieved would stay as they were forever. One of them \r\nis the nature of work — how we envisage it, how we \r\ncompensate it, how we maximize its efficiency and how \r\nthe State creates new safety nets. That is a conversation \r\nthat has just started globally, but that will shape public \r\ndebate during our lifetime.\r\nWe can take the antagonistic view that technological \r\nprogress is bad for us, that it will lead to new types of \r\npoverty, that it will strip people of their rights or even \r\ntake decisions out of our hands. While such concerns \r\nmay serve the needs of some politicians in the short \r\nterm, and even appeal to well-meaning people who are \r\nafraid that progress will cost them their jobs or even \r\nmore, such an approach is as myopic as advocating in \r\nthe past that horse-drawn carts should not be replaced \r\nby motor vehicles.\r\nWhether we are talking about immigration or \r\ntechnology, we do not arrive at solutions by closing \r\ndoors. The digital economy should be seen as an \r\nopportunity, but we must realize that we cannot do \r\nthe best job of harnessing its opportunities without \r\nevolving the current social contracts we have in place. \r\nThose who will be able to pair the digital economy with \r\na new State, the digital State, will be best poised to \r\nhave a future-proof society in which change does not \r\ngalvanize extremes but helps to ensure further decades \r\nof sensible, mainstream policymaking and prosperity.\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 43/59\r\nMr. Beleffi (San Marino), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThen there are the other big questions for which \r\nthe dawn of the digital age requires answers. Can we \r\nsolve diplomatic negotiations that are at a stalemate by \r\napplying algorithms that can avoid war? Can we disarm \r\nterrorists by using the latest technologies? Is it possible \r\nto know immediately which remote parts of our planet \r\nneed international humanitarian assistance? Could we \r\ncreate new organs for people so that no one on a waiting \r\nlist dies for lack of a donor? Can we look forward to the \r\nday when humankind can be told that there is a cure for \r\nall cancers?\r\nOnly time will tell. But it is the accessibility of \r\nadvanced technologies that will lead to solutions, \r\nhopefully for the whole world. I believe passionately \r\nthat technology can revolutionize and improve systems. \r\nThat is why we have launched Malta as the blockchain \r\nisland by being the first jurisdiction worldwide to \r\nregulate that new technology, which previously existed \r\nin a legal vacuum. Blockchain makes cryptocurrencies, \r\nthe inevitable future of money, more transparent, since \r\nit helps to separate good business from bad.\r\nBut such distributed-ledger technologies can do \r\nmuch more. They can provide solutions to health-\r\ncare systems in which patients have real ownership \r\nof their medical records. Emissions-trading systems \r\ncan be taken to the next level. We can help to verify \r\nthat humanitarian assistance is reaching its intended \r\ndestination. We can make sure that people are not \r\ndeprived of their legitimate property because of \r\ncompromised data. Corporations will be able to become \r\nmore accountable to their shareholders. States will \r\nhave to move from hoarding information on citizens \r\nto regulating an environment where citizens trust the \r\nhandling of their data.\r\nThose are just a few of the ways in which we can \r\ncounter regressive and reactionary politics. This forum \r\nshows that we stand to gain through dialogue and \r\ncooperation, which will always triumph over division \r\nand self-absorption because in unity we can have hope.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Malta for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Malta, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mamuka Bakhtadze, Prime \r\nMinister of Georgia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Georgia.\r\nMr. Mamuka Bakhtadze, Prime Minister of \r\nGeorgia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Mamuka Bakhtadze, \r\nPrime Minister of Georgia, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Bakhtadze (Georgia) (spoke in Georgian: \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): It is a great \r\nhonour to address the General Assembly in my native \r\ntongue, Georgian, one of the most ancient languages of \r\nworld civilization and an integral part of it.\r\nToday is 27 September, an extremely troubling and \r\npainful date in my country’s history. Twenty-five years \r\nago today, the occupation of a historical part of Georgia \r\nstarted, turning into an extremely severe challenge for \r\nGeorgia’s newly established statehood. Ten years ago, \r\nthe Russian Federation launched yet another large-scale \r\nmilitary aggression against my country, which resulted \r\nin the full-scale occupation of Georgia’s two historic \r\nand integral regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali.\r\nTen years after that military aggression, our \r\nterritories remain occupied. As a result of ethnic \r\ncleansing, 10 per cent of our population is still forcefully \r\ndisplaced, while the rights of hundreds of thousands \r\nof our citizens are being disregarded. The situation \r\nin Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali regions is dire and \r\nalarming. The situation in the occupied territories is a \r\nhumanitarian disaster of the worst kind. The growing \r\nmilitarization of those regions is in full swing, and \r\ndepopulation is increasing by the minute. Because of the \r\ngrave humanitarian, socioeconomic and human rights \r\nsituation, the population in the occupied regions has \r\ndropped by a factor of four or five since the occupation \r\nbegan. Razor wire and other artificial barriers split \r\nfamilies and violate fundamental human rights. Those \r\nwho live along the occupation lines are even prevented \r\nfrom visiting houses of prayer and the graves of their \r\nancestors. Our citizens are forbidden to educate their \r\nchildren in their native language. Abductions, torture \r\nand murder continue. Archil Tatunashvili, Giga \r\nOtkhozoria and 18-year-old Davit Basharuli are recent \r\nvictims of such atrocities. Because of those and many \r\nother cruel offences, the Otkhozoria-Tatunashvili list \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n44/59 18-30067\r\nwas created in order to record the names of those who \r\nhave committed such egregious crimes. We believe \r\nthat those on the list must be held accountable through \r\napplicable international law.\r\nThe occupation and blatant disregard of the rule of \r\nlaw has created serious challenges to the stability and \r\nsecurity of Georgia and the wider region. Owing to the \r\nexisting conflicts in the South Caucasus, even a minor \r\nincident may escalate into uncontainable unrest with \r\nsubsequent serious consequences. The international \r\ncommunity’s firm support for the peaceful resolution \r\nof the Russia-Georgia conflict is critically important. \r\nThe international community must stand together \r\nand strong in support of the principle of the sovereign \r\nequality of States and the inviolability of their \r\ninternationally recognized borders, because only by \r\nobserving the fundamental norms of international law \r\nand protecting human rights can we ensure peace and \r\nsecurity throughout the world.\r\nRussia has yet to fulfil its international obligations \r\nand respect the 2008 ceasefire agreement reached \r\nthrough the mediation of the European Union (EU). We, \r\non the other hand, have fulfilled that agreement down \r\nto the smallest detail and have assumed the legally \r\nbinding obligation not to use force. That affirms our \r\nirreversible policy of seeking an exclusively peaceful \r\nresolution of the conflict. I therefore urge the Russian \r\nFederation to fulfil the international obligations that \r\nit has signed and withdraw its occupation forces from \r\nGeorgia’s territory. \r\nWe are actively trying to use the format of the \r\nGeneva international discussions, but our attempts \r\nat the negotiation table have met with unfounded and \r\nabsolutely unacceptable resistance from Russia. I would \r\nlike to reiterate that we attach special importance to the \r\nrole of the United Nations in the Geneva talks, which the \r\nUnited Nations co-chairs along with the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe and the EU.\r\nIn the twenty-first century, as people, nations and \r\ncultures strive for greater integration and development, \r\nthe installation of artificial barriers and barbed wire are \r\nabsolutely unacceptable. We want to break the deadlock \r\nin the relations between Russia and Georgia, but that \r\ncan be accomplished only through respect for Georgia’s \r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty and the principles \r\nof international law. Despite the injustice that we have \r\nsuffered, our only response to these challenges has \r\nbeen to continue our quest for peace and Georgia’s \r\ndevelopment. We have proposed a new peace initiative \r\ndesigned to overcome the humanitarian disaster in the \r\noccupied territories and create new opportunities for \r\nour citizens there. With that initiative, we are fighting \r\nto stop the process of depopulation in the occupied \r\nterritories and ensure respect for people’s fundamental \r\nhuman rights. We call that initiative “A Step to a Better \r\nFuture”, and it seeks precisely to provide the populations \r\nin the occupied territories with access to health care \r\nand educational services and to create opportunities for \r\nincome-generating activities for them so that they can \r\nfeed their families and ensure their physical survival.\r\nToday, from this rostrum, I would like to address \r\nour Abkhaz and Ossetian compatriots. Georgia’s every \r\nsuccess is their success. We share a common historical \r\npast, which must pave the way for our future, which I \r\nam convinced will bring us peace and prosperity. It is \r\nthe Georgian authorities’ duty to protect and guarantee \r\nthe rights of every citizen, and we are irreversibly \r\ncommitted to fulfilling that duty. They should enjoy all \r\nthe benefits put in place by Georgia, whether regarding \r\nhuman rights, education, health care or visa-free travel \r\nto Europe. I would particularly like to address young \r\npeople there. Together, through joint efforts and pursuing \r\nopportunities, we can achieve success and prosperity. I \r\nwant the youth to know that it is only in unity with them \r\nthat we see our future. And I would once again like to \r\nurge Russia not to undermine or compromise our peace \r\ninitiatives and to make it possible for the citizens in the \r\noccupied territories to lead a decent life.\r\nWith its rich culture and ancient history, Georgia \r\nhas always stood with the world’s civilized nations and \r\ncontributed to the development of European and global \r\ncivilizations. Accordingly, we remain engaged in the \r\nfight against the challenges facing humankind. Today, \r\nunfortunately, that list is quite long. It includes conflicts, \r\nterrorism, migration and forced displacement, climate \r\nchange, poverty and grave human rights violations. \r\nAddressing those issues requires enormous efforts and \r\nstrong political will on the part of the United Nations \r\nand each Member State. Each and every one of us must \r\nconfront those challenges in order to make the world \r\na better place. We strongly believe that the pursuit of \r\nnational interests in the modern world should be based \r\non mutual respect and should in no way be carried \r\nout at the expense of others. It is in that context that \r\nI would like to echo the theme of this year’s session \r\nof the General Assembly and reaffirm that we are \r\ncommitted to making our contribution to our shared \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 45/59\r\ngoal of peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, \r\nand to strengthening the role of the United Nations by \r\nhelping it to make progress in achieving its goals.\r\nIn establishing a democratic republic, a century \r\nago, Georgia made its civilizational choice to define \r\nthe future of our nation. We belong in the common \r\nEuropean family. That choice remains unchanged and is \r\nyet another strong argument confirming our European \r\nidentity. Georgia, with its values and contributions, has \r\nalways been an organic part of Europe,  as shown by its \r\nsuccessful cooperation with the EU. \r\nWhen Georgia declared independence, a century \r\nago, its Constitution was built on the very values and \r\nprinciples that remain relevant and progressive even \r\ntoday. Suffice it to say that a century ago the multiparty \r\nGeorgian Parliament included five women, an \r\nachievement rarely found even among the established \r\ndemocracies of that time. This year my country is \r\ncelebrating the 100th anniversary of that event, the \r\ndeclaration of our democratic republic. Georgia \r\nregained its independence 27 years ago and embarked \r\non a path to building a modern democratic State. It \r\nmay not seem like a long time in historical terms, but \r\nour young democracy has faced numerous trials and \r\ntribulations over that period. Today’s Georgia is the \r\nheir and successor to the values enshrined a century \r\nago.\r\nGeorgia’s progress in recent years in terms of \r\ndemocratic consolidation, respect for human rights and \r\nstrengthening the rule of law is the unequivocal result \r\nof its fundamental reforms. Our strong Parliament, \r\nnon-partisan President, independent judiciary and \r\neffective Government are the outcome of our successful \r\nconstitutional reform, and the country is therefore \r\nswitching to a European parliamentary model of \r\ngovernance. For us, the country’s development fully \r\nfocuses on free human beings and on human capital \r\ncreated by those free human beings. Our ambitious \r\neducation reforms and modernization of the education \r\nsystem will be yet another breakthrough on the path \r\nto overcoming the challenges that we face today. Only \r\neducated, motivated, confident young people can \r\nbring about progress, eliminate poverty and ensure \r\nthat Georgia joins the developed and innovative \r\neconomies. A small, f lexible and effective Government \r\nis counterbalanced by strong public and institutional \r\nmechanisms of control and civil society, which \r\nperfectly reflects our commitments under Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 16.\r\nGeorgia’s election last year as Chair of the Open \r\nGovernment Partnership was a recognition of our \r\ncountry’s achievements, bearing witness to the \r\neffectiveness of the efforts that have brought our society \r\nconcrete results. Protecting fundamental human rights \r\nand dignity is our top priority. In that regard, Georgia \r\nhas emerged as the region’s leading reformer in recent \r\nyears. Especially noteworthy is the fact that we have \r\novercome a major challenge in the penitentiary system \r\nthat we inherited. Most notably, we have made visible \r\nprogress with regard to the respect for human rights \r\nin prisons. We have implemented important judicial \r\nreforms, which we intend to continue by launching the \r\nnext wave of reforms. One of the main achievements \r\nof our political action has been to establish media \r\nfreedom and media pluralism. In 2018, Georgia further \r\nimproved its position in the World Press Freedom \r\nIndex, and we have exceptional achievements in the \r\narea of Internet freedom.\r\nCivil society plays a definitive role in the process \r\nof building democracy. Without a strong civil \r\nsociety, especially in a young democracy, a country’s \r\nharmonious development is unimaginable. We want an \r\nindependent, strong, and active civil society to develop \r\nin our country. Under our sustainable development \r\npolicy, we have prioritized green policies and a green \r\neconomy. At the same time, we are developing a \r\ndigital economy poised to advance the country to a \r\nqualitatively new level. Our economic strategy relies \r\non inclusive economic development and economic \r\ngrowth, which are being reflected in the well-being of \r\neach citizen. We have been successfully implementing \r\nthat strategy, aimed at transforming Georgia into the \r\nregion’s economic, tourism, logistics and educational \r\nhub, as evidenced by our leading positions in reputable \r\ninternational rankings.\r\nOur country’s unique geography and strategic \r\nlocation between Europe and Asia have positioned \r\nGeorgia for centuries as an attractive meeting place \r\nfor civilizations and cultural dialogue. We continue to \r\nfulfil that function, and we are implementing ambitious \r\nand crucial new projects to that end. A few years \r\nago, we addressed the world from this rostrum and \r\noffered to host the Silk Road Forum in Georgia. We \r\nhave not only made the Forum a reality but have also \r\nreclaimed Georgia’s historical role in the wider Silk \r\nRoad region. Today, however, I would like to propose a \r\nnew initiative and offer to facilitate the Tbilisi Forum, \r\nfocusing on transforming the Black Sea region and the \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n46/59 18-30067\r\nCaucasus, which are currently areas of confrontation \r\nand challenges, into a space for peace, cooperation, \r\nand development.\r\nGeorgia’s every achievement, its democratic and \r\neconomic development and leading regional position in \r\nvarious areas are the result specifically of our European \r\nand Euro-Atlantic choice, which is enshrined in the \r\nConstitution and the relevant parliamentary resolutions. \r\nNATO-Georgia relations have become very dynamic \r\nand comprehensive. Georgia is a NATO-aspirant \r\ncountry and an enhanced opportunities partner, as well \r\nas the largest per capita contributor of troops to the \r\nUnited Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan, thereby \r\ncontributing to the architecture of global security.\r\nEveryone here is aware of the disturbing threat posed \r\nby transnational terrorism, which is much larger and \r\nmore overwhelming today than ever before. Terrorism \r\nis the twenty-first century’s common enemy. In the fight \r\nagainst that shared threat, Georgia has always stood, \r\nand will continue to stand, shoulder to shoulder with the \r\ninternational community. Unfortunately, many valiant \r\nGeorgian soldiers have fallen in the global fight. We all \r\nagree that combating terrorism, along with preventing \r\nand responding adequately to that scourge, is possible \r\nonly through joint efforts and shared responsibilities. I \r\nam convinced that we will defeat it.\r\nGeorgia’s pain is not a problem facing one country \r\nalone. In 2008, the world perceived the aggression \r\nagainst Georgia as a problem in the relations between \r\njust two countries. The way things continued to \r\nunfold, however, showed that at the time the world \r\nwas unprepared to adequately assess and respond to \r\nthat aggression. Unfortunately, the United Nations \r\nproved ineffective in the face of that challenge. Today, \r\nthe global security system is eroding before our very \r\neyes. Today’s world needs a stronger United Nations, \r\nand the international community needs institutions \r\ncapable of properly evaluating and responding to \r\ntoday’s challenges and preventing the risks that are \r\nundermining global security.\r\nAs Members know, the debates on reforming the \r\nUnited Nations began in the 1990s, although we must \r\nadmit that we cannot see any serious success in that \r\ndirection so far. That is why the issue of reforming \r\nthe United Nations remains relevant, and I believe \r\nthat it requires immediate action. As the world faces \r\nthe challenges of a new era with problems yet to \r\nbe identified, we all have the task of reacting to and \r\njointly overcoming global challenges in order to ensure \r\na peaceful and better world for future generations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nGeorgia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mamuka Bakhtadze, Prime Minister of \r\nGeorgia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Prime \r\nMinister of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Socialist \r\nRepublic of Viet Nam.\r\nMr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Prime Minister of the \r\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc, \r\nPrime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc (spoke in Vietnamese; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I am very \r\nhonoured to deliver this statement during the general \r\ndebate of the General Assembly at the beginning of its \r\nseventy-third session, whose theme has been chosen \r\nas “Making the United Nations relevant to all people: \r\nglobal leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”.\r\nI should like to congratulate Ms. Espinosa Garcés \r\non her election as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-third session. I believe that this session \r\nwill be a great success under her leadership. I would \r\nalso like to express my appreciation for the very \r\nimportant initiatives that Secretary-General Guterres \r\nhas championed since taking office.\r\nMay I also, on behalf of the Government and \r\npeople of Viet Nam, express my sincere gratitude to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the minute of silence observed in \r\nmemory of the late President of the Socialist Republic \r\nof Viet Nam, who recently passed.\r\nHumankind has still not forgotten the scourge of \r\nthe two World Wars of the twentieth century. However, \r\nsince the birth of the United Nations in 1945, world \r\nwars have become a thing of the past. The foundations \r\nof peace on our planet have continued to be reinforced \r\nthanks to the efforts of the United Nations, the largest \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 47/59\r\nmultilateral organization where the largest number \r\nof countries meet. Over the past 70 years, the United \r\nNations has played an enormous role through its tireless \r\nefforts to preserve peace, prevent conflicts and wars and \r\nrealize the purposes and principles of the Organization \r\nas codified in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nWe have seen significant achievements in recent \r\nyears in global cooperation and development, ranging \r\nfrom the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons \r\nto reforms of the United Nations, the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals in 2015 and the \r\nadoption and implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nThe United Nations has also been vital in efforts \r\nto address global issues, including reducing poverty, \r\nprotecting women and children, promoting human \r\nrights, improving health care, culture and education, \r\npreserving the environment and responding to climate \r\nchange. Today the United Nations has truly become \r\na symbol of global solidarity, the embodiment of \r\nhumankind and progress and the place where our \r\naspirations for a world of peace, prosperity and equality \r\nare realized.\r\nViet Nam has been a companion to the United \r\nNations and contributed to the noble goals pursued by \r\nthe Organization over the past 70 years. We are a staunch \r\nsupporter of the central role of the United Nations in \r\nthe multilateral international system and have actively \r\njoined in efforts to realize its fundamental cooperation \r\npillars — the maintenance of global peace and security, \r\ndevelopment cooperation and the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights.\r\nOnce a poor, underdeveloped country with a food \r\ndeficit, over the past 20 years Viet Nam has recorded \r\naverage annual gross domestic product growth of more \r\nthan 6 per cent to become one of the world’s largest food \r\nexporters. Since 2010, we have been a middle-income \r\ndeveloping country, and the living standards of our \r\nnearly 100 million citizens have improved dramatically. \r\nBy actively engaging in international integration, \r\nViet Nam enjoys free trading relations with nearly 60 \r\nmajor countries and partners in the world through its \r\nmembership of 16 free trade agreements.\r\nMost recently, we successfully hosted the Asia-\r\nPacific Economic Cooperation throughout 2017, the \r\n132nd Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\nin 2015, the 2018 World Economic Forum on the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\nand the sixth Greater Mekong Subregion Cooperation \r\nSummit in 2018. We are also working towards the \r\nASEAN Community Vision 2025, which aims to \r\nstrengthen ASEAN centrality in the evolving regional \r\narchitecture. Viet Nam has also taken the initiative \r\nand taken part in many important United Nations \r\nmechanisms, contributing responsibly in many \r\ndifferent areas.\r\nViet Nam is also making greater efforts to promote \r\njustice and sustainable development, foster equality \r\nand support for disadvantaged groups, protect the \r\nenvironment and ensure rights for all citizens, while \r\nupholding a spirit of dialogue and cooperation in \r\nthe area of human rights. We have always attached \r\nimportance to preserving cultural and natural heritage \r\nand national identity. We are one of the few countries \r\nto have accomplished many of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals ahead of schedule, particularly for \r\npoverty reduction.\r\nWe have made it our consistent policy to uphold \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law with regard to the \r\nsettlement of international disputes through peaceful \r\nmeans. That includes in the South China Sea, where \r\nthere are issues that should be addressed on the basis of \r\nthe 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea and the need to safeguard maritime security and \r\nsafety and the freedom of navigation and overflight.\r\nCooperation and assistance from the international \r\ncommunity, including the United Nations, has been \r\nextremely valuable for Viet Nam in its efforts to achieve \r\nsustainable development, international integration and \r\npoverty reduction. On this occasion, I would like, on \r\nbehalf of the Vietnamese Government and people, to \r\nexpress my sincere gratitude to the United Nations and \r\nall countries and international organizations that have \r\nlent their active and effective assistance to Viet Nam.\r\nOur planet is experiencing rapid change, propelled \r\nby the scientific and technological breakthroughs of the \r\nfourth industrial revolution as well as the irreversible \r\ntrend of globalization. That opens up a range of new \r\nopportunities to guide humankind into a new era of \r\neconomic growth unprecedented in the history of our \r\ncivilization, further bolstering the main global currents \r\nof peace, cooperation and development.\r\nYet the world is also facing immense new \r\nchallenges. World peace has yet to be guaranteed, \r\nalthough the situation on the Korean peninsula has \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n48/59 18-30067\r\nseen new progress. In the Middle East, Africa and \r\nelsewhere, conflict, or the threat of conflict, is ongoing, \r\nand immigration remains a pressing matter for many \r\ncountries. Power politics, the use or threat of force and \r\nthe rise of unilateral measures continue to pose threats \r\nto international peace and stability. Injustice and \r\ninequality remain in many parts of the world. Risks and \r\ninstabilities are ever-present in global development. The \r\neffects of climate change and environmental pollution \r\nare widespread. Poverty is still a major challenge, \r\nwith nearly 750 million people still living in extreme \r\npoverty, among whom are many children suffering \r\nfrom hunger and deprivation without access to health \r\ncare or proper education.\r\nNo single nation, regardless of its might or wealth, \r\ncan single-handedly address those enormous global \r\nchallenges. They require the common efforts and \r\ncollaboration of all nations. I would like to suggest that \r\na concept of dual responsibility should be universally \r\nupheld. Each nation should take additional responsibility \r\nfor addressing global issues, and each individual should \r\ntake additional responsibility as a global citizen.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, I share Secretary-General \r\nGuterres’s view that the role of the United Nations \r\nhas become all the more important in the creation \r\nof new foundations for more effectively addressing \r\nglobal challenges. We must continue highlighting the \r\nrole of the United Nations and join hands for a world \r\nof peace, equality and sustainable development. In \r\nthat process, it is my hope that the major Powers and \r\ndeveloped countries will take meaningful action to play \r\nan exemplary role in maintaining peace and fostering \r\ndevelopment. The General Assembly should be the \r\nheart of cooperation among countries and peoples for \r\npeace, equality and sustainable development.\r\nIn that connection, we support lifting the unilateral \r\nembargo on Cuba, so that nation can exercise its freedom \r\nto participate equitably and fairly in economic and \r\ntrading relations in accordance with international law.\r\nPeace, freedom and prosperity have always been \r\nthe desire and aspiration of all peoples. In the age of the \r\nfourth industrial revolution, humankind’s progress is \r\nmeasured not only by feats of technological advancement \r\nbut first and foremost by peace and prosperity. Even \r\nthe smallest opportunity for peace must be cherished \r\nand nurtured. From its long struggle for freedom and \r\nindependence, Viet Nam has a profound understanding \r\nof the value of peace, equality, self-determination, the \r\nright to the pursuit of happiness and the democratic \r\nvalues extolled by the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThe voices of small nations and the aspirations of the \r\ndisadvantaged must be respected, heard and shared. \r\nThat is the foundation for a sustainable and inclusive \r\ndevelopment that leaves no one behind. That is the \r\nfoundation for social stability, which is needed to ensure \r\nthe rights of every person and harness their creativity.\r\nToday it is vital that the United Nations engage \r\nin strong and comprehensive reforms, improving its \r\neffectiveness, democracy and transparency, so as to \r\nbetter fulfil its indispensable role in leading efforts to \r\naddress global challenges. As quoted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his opening remarks (see A/73/PV.6), the \r\nlate Secretary-General Kofi Annan once said:\r\n“[W]e share a common destiny. We can master it \r\nonly if we face it together. And that, my friends, is \r\nwhy we have the United Nations.” (see SG/SM/7262)\r\nThat is also the reason why, immediately after the \r\nestablishment of the Vietnamese State on 2 September \r\n1945, the beloved late President of the Vietnamese \r\npeople, Ho Chi Minh, submitted a request for \r\nmembership of the United Nations in January 1946.\r\nI ask now what we want the United Nations to \r\nbe. In answering that question, we must applaud the \r\nreform proposals that Secretary-General Guterres \r\nhas initiated, particularly on repositioning the United \r\nNations development system. I propose that the United \r\nNations strengthen cooperation with the various regions \r\nof the world, particularly in terms of United Nations-\r\nASEAN high-level cooperation mechanisms, which \r\nfurther highlight the role of the United Nations within \r\nASEAN and vice versa.\r\nViet Nam takes pride in being an active member \r\nof the United Nations. Ours is a foreign policy of \r\nindependence, self-reliance, peace, cooperation and \r\ndevelopment, and multilateralism and diversification \r\nin our foreign relations, as well as active and engaged \r\ninternational integration. With that policy, we hope to \r\nmake greater contributions to the creation of multilateral \r\nmechanisms and the fulfilment of the common \r\nresponsibilities of the international community. For \r\ninstance, Viet Nam has dispatched a level-2 field \r\nhospital to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan.\r\nMore recently, Viet Nam has submitted its \r\ncandidacy for non-permanent membership of the \r\nSecurity Council for the 2020-2021 term. I would like \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 49/59\r\nto express my heartfelt gratitude to the 53 countries of \r\nthe Asia-Pacific States Group for endorsing Viet Nam \r\nas the sole candidate of the Group, and to many others \r\nfor their extensive support for our candidature so far. In \r\nthis most prestigious forum, I would like, on behalf of \r\nthe Vietnamese Government and people, to call for, and \r\nvery much hope to receive, the support of all Member \r\nStates. Viet Nam is committed to being an active and \r\nresponsible member of the international community \r\nand the United Nations.\r\nWe have every reason to believe that given \r\nour global partnership, solidarity and high level of \r\ncommitment, the Sustainable Development Goals and \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will \r\nsucceed, showing that we can live up to the aspirations \r\nof all humankind for a world of peace, equality and \r\nsustainable development. In that spirit, may the \r\nseventy-third session of the General Assembly be a \r\nresounding success.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Prime Minister of the \r\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Andrew Holness, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Defence, Economic \r\nGrowth and Job Creation of Jamaica\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister \r\nof Defence, Economic Growth and Job Creation \r\nof Jamaica.\r\nMr. Andrew Holness, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nof Defence, Economic Growth and Job Creation of \r\nJamaica, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Andrew Holness, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Defence, Economic Growth \r\nand Job Creation of Jamaica, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Holness (Jamaica): I warmly congratulate \r\nMs. Espinosa Garcés on her election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. \r\nOf the four women who have served as President \r\nover the years, she is the first from Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean. Jamaica is especially pleased that \r\nthis honour has been conferred on such an eminent \r\nappointee from our region. We also share her desire \r\nto see a better gender balance in the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly in the years ahead. She can be \r\nassured of Jamaica’s full support during her tenure.\r\nThe chosen theme for this session resonates well \r\nwith us. It is imperative that we make the United \r\nNations relevant to all people through global leadership \r\nand shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies.\r\nThis year it has been a decade since the global \r\neconomic and financial crisis manifested itself in \r\n2008. We are greatly encouraged by reports from \r\ninternational development partners that global growth \r\nhas improved and unemployment has declined to its \r\nlowest since the crisis. We are, however, mindful that \r\namong developing economies, including small island \r\ndeveloping States such as mine, growth prospects are \r\nbecoming more uneven.\r\nWe remain vulnerable to a gamut of social, \r\neconomic, environmental, financial and trade-related \r\nhazards, from within and beyond our borders. In \r\nthat context, Jamaica’s quest to achieve inclusive and \r\nsustainable economic growth and meaningful job \r\ncreation has encountered challenges. Ten years on, \r\nwe still face the vagaries of an uncertain and at times \r\nvolatile global economic environment. Together with \r\npersistent challenges linked to climate change and \r\nmore frequent intense weather events, those problems \r\nall impact the pace of our development.\r\nNotwithstanding the multiple challenges that \r\nconfront us individually or collectively, Jamaica is \r\ndeveloping the social and political consensus it needs \r\nto pursue policies that will secure our economic \r\nindependence. In the past decade, we have engaged \r\nin deep structural reform of our economy, reduced \r\nour debt profile from its previous very high level, \r\ntransformed our energy sector and increased our social \r\nsupport for the most vulnerable. What has been the \r\nresult? Our sovereign ratings and outlook have moved \r\nfrom negative to positive.\r\nJamaica is not sitting and waiting for the world \r\nto save it. As a small island developing State with \r\nnumerous challenges, we are taking our destiny into \r\nour own hands. Ultimately, we believe that economic \r\nindependence will secure our resilience. Nevertheless, \r\nwe continue to strengthen traditional partnerships and \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n50/59 18-30067\r\nbuild new ones with like-minded countries around \r\nthe world that see the global benefits generated when \r\ncountries big and small, rich and poor, work together to \r\nsolve issues too big for any of us to solve alone.\r\nThis year, Jamaica was pleased to be invited to \r\nrepresent the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \r\nat outreach sessions of the Group of Seven and the \r\nSummit of the BRICS group of Brazil, Russia, India, \r\nChina and South Africa. We have also represented \r\nCARICOM throughout the year at meetings of the \r\nGroup of 20 under the Argentine presidency. Those \r\nforums represent extremely influential groupings of \r\ncountries. Jamaica believes that such groupings provide \r\na unique opportunity, working alongside international \r\ndevelopment partners, to address the problems faced by \r\nweaker economies across the globe. Jamaica therefore \r\nwelcomes the opportunity to share perspectives with \r\nour stronger economic partners to ensure that they \r\ngain an understanding of the risks that we face in our \r\nregion of small developing States, most of which are \r\nisland States.\r\nJamaica stands ready to continue working on how \r\nwe can transform global thinking and together find \r\neffective solutions within a fair, rules-based multilateral \r\nsystem that is supportive of policies that seek to \r\nensure the emergence and empowerment of small and \r\ndeveloping States, truly leaving no country — and no \r\none — behind.\r\nOur concerted action must embody effective \r\nstrategies to bolster the global financial system through \r\na robust global campaign to identify funding for the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and resilience and adaptation measures \r\nto address the devastating effects of climate change \r\nand natural disasters. Jamaica and our CARICOM \r\nbrothers and sisters do not have the luxury of engaging \r\nin a philosophical debate on whether or not climate \r\nchange is real. The issue is existential for us. Major \r\nstorms are no longer uncommon; they have given way \r\nto superstorms. They are stronger and more frequent. \r\nEvery year, the Caribbean region, running right up \r\nto the south-eastern coast of the United States of \r\nAmerica, lives in fear for five months — five months of \r\nhoping that the devastation that was wreaked on North \r\nCarolina, Antigua and Barbuda, Texas and Grenada is \r\nnot visited upon them this year.\r\nHave Member States seen what has happened to \r\nDominica? The disaster wreaked by those superstorms \r\nis the closest thing that we can imagine or compare \r\nto a nuclear event. After four hours of one hurricane, \r\nDominica lost most of its gross domestic product (GDP). \r\nThe people of that small island are still recovering today.\r\nAs the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nimplementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction 2015-2030 (A/73/268) confirms, last \r\nyear we witnessed the costliest North Atlantic hurricane \r\nseason yet, with losses estimated at $229 billion. \r\nFurthermore, the economic cost of climate-related \r\ndisasters globally was $320 billion.\r\nWith special reference to the issue of climate change, \r\nI was particularly honoured by the invitation from \r\nSecretary-General Guterres to join him and President \r\nMacron of France in leading a special initiative to \r\nmobilize funds committed at the Copenhagen Summit \r\nin 2009 to the amount of $100 billion per year until \r\n2020. We are only two years away from the deadline \r\nbut as of today we are nowhere near the target. We must \r\ntherefore galvanize an effective mobilization campaign. \r\nAgainst that background, my delegation looks forward \r\nto the climate change summit to be convened by the \r\nSecretary-General in 2019. More specifically, I am \r\nalso personally committed to working assiduously to \r\nstrengthen momentum aimed at securing the promised \r\nresources to address climate-related issues, which \r\naffect all of us.\r\nMany of the structural factors that impede \r\nour ability to narrow the persistent income gap \r\nbetween developing and advanced economies can be \r\naddressed through the successful implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nits 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Global \r\nestimates of the scale of the SDGs financing gap run on \r\nthe order of from $5 trillion to $7 trillion per annum. \r\nMeaningful progress in that regard will require us to tap \r\ninto various sources of funding. I cannot overstate the \r\nimportance of including innovative ways of mobilizing \r\nprivate-sector financing.\r\nIn addition, several small island developing \r\nStates like Jamaica are deemed to have graduated to \r\nmiddle-income status primarily by virtue of their GDP \r\nper capita. Many of them, however, are highly indebted \r\nand vulnerable. High debt ratios constrain our ability to \r\nsecure domestic fiscal resources at a reasonable cost for \r\nthe implementation of national development goals. The \r\nreality is that even though many have made progress \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 51/59\r\nin reducing levels of extreme poverty, several of our \r\nbroader development efforts have stalled.\r\nWe therefore highly commend the work of the \r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, which has affirmed the importance of \r\ncomplementing the per-capita income criterion by \r\naddressing structural gaps that retard development \r\nprospects for middle-income countries. Accordingly, \r\nI am reiterating my call for international financial \r\ninstitutions to address that persistent problem known \r\nas the middle-income trap. We believe that a special \r\ninitiative for highly indebted middle-income countries \r\ncould provide the framework for the type of support \r\nthat those countries require. It is our great hope that the \r\nUnited Nations high-level meeting on middle-income \r\ncountries, scheduled for later this year, will give its \r\nfullest consideration to those matters and to ways \r\nin which the United Nations system can provide \r\nbetter support.\r\nIn the interim, Jamaica continues to work with \r\npartners like Canada to provide a platform where \r\ncountries can engage directly with actors in the private \r\nsector, development finance institutions and regulators. \r\nOur goal is to forge collaborative partnerships between \r\nUnited Nations Member States and the private sector \r\nin order to determine practical, solution-oriented ways \r\nof securing new and long-term capital investment, \r\nutilizing a mix of public, private and blended financing \r\nto implement the SDGs.\r\nEven as we diligently seek financing for sustainable \r\ndevelopment, we are mindful that we live in a world \r\nwhere international peace and security are under \r\ncontinued threat. The world has witnessed several \r\nterrorist attacks and is grappling with a range of conflicts \r\nthat appear intractable. The Secretary-General has \r\ntherefore appropriately emphasized conflict prevention \r\nas well as promoting a new disarmament agenda. As \r\nhe has often said, we must confront issues concerning \r\npeace and security along a peace continuum, from \r\nprevention, conflict resolution and peacekeeping to \r\npeacebuilding and sustainable long-term development.\r\nJamaica is especially interested in the efforts to \r\nbuild a secure environment by combating the illicit \r\ntraffic and trade in small arms and light weapons. We \r\nhave made significant national institutional changes, \r\nundertaken policy enhancements and adopted legislative \r\namendments in the areas of security and justice in our \r\nown country. We now look forward to working with \r\nother Member States, the United Nations system and \r\npartners at all levels to ensure that the progress we have \r\nmade is sustainable.\r\nSocieties function best when an inclusive global \r\nenvironment is created where no one feels left behind. \r\nThe implementation of the SDGs must be people-centred. \r\nEmbargoes and other financial and economic barriers \r\nmust not become tools aimed at preventing people such \r\nas our neighbours the citizens of the Republic of Cuba \r\nfrom attaining their rightful development goals. Jamaica \r\ncontinues to call for a lifting of the embargoes on that \r\ncountry. We also believe that it is important to support \r\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special \r\nEnvoys in pursuing the political processes related to \r\nsituations such as those in the Western Sahara, Syria \r\nand Myanmar.\r\nAs we prepare to commemorate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, let us continue to be mindful of the many \r\namong us who consistently face discrimination in \r\nvarious forms. Jamaica has been at the forefront of \r\ninternational human rights efforts, having been the first \r\ncountry to incorporate human rights into its foreign-\r\npolicy strategy, a principle that we guard fiercely. We \r\nwill never lose sight of the responsibility to promote \r\nand protect the interests of the vulnerable. We are \r\nespecially keen to ensure that our women, children, \r\npersons living with disabilities, our elderly and young \r\npeople can make meaningful contributions to a safe and \r\nprosperous society and reap its benefits. Jamaica will \r\nshortly become a member of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, which is currently presided over by Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines. Our term of office will \r\ncoincide with what promises to be a momentous year \r\nfor that body. We are committed to advancing the work \r\nof the Council, including during its High-level Political \r\nForum on Sustainable Development.\r\nSocieties are not sustainable without healthy \r\ncitizens. As a region that has been severely affected \r\nby non-communicable diseases, we in the Caribbean \r\nare actively promoting and implementing measures to \r\nreverse that trend by encouraging health and wellness. \r\nI felt truly energized as I joined my CARICOM \r\ncolleagues this morning in launching Caribbean \r\nMoves, a region-wide initiative aimed at raising \r\nawareness and increasing physical activity among our \r\nyoung people, as well as those who are not so young. \r\nWe look forward to building on the outcomes of the \r\nhigh-level meeting that has been convened this week on \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n52/59 18-30067\r\nnon-communicable diseases. Jamaica will also support \r\nongoing actions to combat tuberculosis and promote \r\nuniversal health coverage.\r\nThe President of the General Assembly has \r\nchallenged us to ensure that the United Nations remains \r\na beacon of hope for each citizen across the globe. To \r\nthat end, the United Nations must be responsive to an \r\never-changing and unpredictable world if it is to remain \r\nrelevant and effective. The Secretary-General is correct \r\nin stating in his report on the work of the Organization \r\nthat\r\n“one of the most valuable assets of the United \r\nNations is its capacity to operate as a convener of \r\npeople, a proponent of ideas, a catalyst for action \r\nand a driver of solutions.” (A/73/1, para. 1)\r\nFor that reason, we remain steadfast in our support \r\nof efforts to reform the United Nations. We commend \r\nthe Secretary-General’s actions in pressing for reform \r\nof the peace and security architecture and the United \r\nNations development system and its management and \r\noperational structure. Of course, we are ever-mindful \r\nof the words of our recently departed former Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, a stalwart of multilateral \r\ndiplomacy, that no reform of the United Nations will be \r\ncomplete without reform of the Security Council.\r\nOur global alliance comprises 193 sovereign \r\nStates, but there is no denying the fact that we are all \r\ninterdependent. A joint and multifaceted response is \r\nrequired to surmount the myriad hurdles ahead of us, \r\nfor it is only through collaboration that we can build our \r\nsocieties and secure our common future. Our legacy \r\nmust be one that uplifts and inspires. Let that therefore \r\nbe our mandate for the seventy-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister of Defence, Economic Growth and Job \r\nCreation of Jamaica for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Andrew Holness, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nof Defence, Economic Growth and Job Creation of \r\nJamaica, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Ms. Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, \r\nand National Security and Intelligence of New \r\nZealand\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nArts, Culture and Heritage, and National Security and \r\nIntelligence of New Zealand.\r\nMs. Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Arts, Culture and Heritage, and National \r\nSecurity and Intelligence of New Zealand, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Ms. Jacinda Ardern, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, \r\nand National Security and Intelligence of New Zealand, \r\nand inviting her to address the Assembly.\r\nMs. Ardern (New Zealand): E nga mana nul o \r\nnga whenua o te ao/Tena koutou katoa/Nei ra te reo \r\nmihl maioha o Aotearoa/Tena tatau i nga kaupapa \r\nkorero/Ka arahina e tatau/Me te ngakau pono/Me te \r\nkotahitanga o te tangata.\r\nMy opening remarks were in Te Reo Maori, the \r\nlanguage of the indigenous people of Aotearoa New \r\nZealand. As is tradition, I acknowledged those who are \r\nhere, why we are here and the importance of our work. \r\nIt seems a fitting place to start.\r\nAs a leader attending my first General Assembly, \r\nI am struck by the power and potential that resides \r\nhere. In New Zealand we have always been acutely \r\naware of that. We are a remote nation at the bottom \r\nof the South Pacific. It takes three hours to reach our \r\nnearest neighbours by plane, and anywhere that takes \r\nless than 12 hours is considered close. I have no doubt, \r\nthough, that our geographic isolation has contributed to \r\nour values.\r\nWe are a self-deprecating people. We are not \r\nones for status. We will celebrate the local people \r\nwho volunteer at their sports clubs as much as we \r\nwill celebrate successful entrepreneurs. Our empathy \r\nand strong sense of justice are matched only by our \r\npragmatism. We are, after all, a country made up of \r\ntwo main islands, one simply named North and the \r\nother South. For all of that, our isolation has not made \r\nus insular. In fact, our engagement with the world has \r\nhelped shape who we are.\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 53/59\r\nI am a child of the 1980s, a period in New Zealand’s \r\nhistory where we did not just observe international \r\nevents, we challenged them. Whether it was apartheid \r\nin South Africa or nuclear testing in the Pacific, I grew \r\nup learning about my country and who we were by the \r\nway that we reacted to international events. Whether it \r\nwas taking to the streets or changing our laws, we have \r\nseen ourselves as members of a community, one that we \r\nhave a duty to use our voice within.\r\nI am an incredibly proud New Zealander, but much \r\nof that pride has come from being a strong and active \r\nmember of our international community, not in spite \r\nof it. At the heart of that international community has \r\nbeen this place. Emerging from a catastrophic war, we \r\nhave collectively established — through convention, \r\ncharters and rules — a set of international norms and \r\nhuman rights. All of these are an acknowledgement \r\nthat we are not isolated, that Governments do have \r\nobligations to their people and to one another and that \r\nour actions have a global effect.\r\nIn 1945, New Zealand’s Prime Minister Peter \r\nFraser said that the Charter of the United Nations \r\noffered perhaps a last opportunity to work in unison to \r\nrealize the hope in the hearts of all of us, for a peace \r\nthat would be real, lasting and worthy of human dignity. \r\nNone of those founding principles should be consigned \r\nto the history books. In fact, given the challenges \r\nwe face today and how truly global they are in their \r\nnature and impact, the need for collective action and \r\nmultilateralism has never been clearer. And yet, for \r\nall of that, the debate and dialogue we hear globally \r\nis not centred on the relevance and importance of our \r\ninternational institutions. Instead, we find ourselves \r\nhaving to defend their very existence. That surely \r\nleaves us all with the questions of how we got here and \r\nhow we get out.\r\nIf anything unites us politically in this place right \r\nnow it is this: globalization has had a massive impact \r\non our nations and the people we serve. While that \r\nimpact has been positive for many, for others it has not. \r\nThe transitions our economies have made have often \r\nbeen jarring and the consequences harsh. Alongside \r\nunprecedented global economic growth, we are still \r\nseeing a growing sense of isolation, dislocation and \r\ninsecurity and the erosion of hope. As politicians and \r\nGovernments, we all have choices in how we respond \r\nto those challenges. We can use the environment to \r\nblame nameless and faceless others, feed the sense of \r\ninsecurity and retreat into greater levels of isolationism, \r\nor we can acknowledge the problems we have and seek \r\nto fix them.\r\nIn New Zealand, going it alone is not an option. \r\nAside from our history, we are also a trading nation, \r\nand proudly so, but even without those founding \r\nprinciples, there are not just questions of nationhood \r\nto consider. There are generational demands on us too. \r\nIt should hardly come as a surprise that we have seen \r\na global trend of young people showing dissatisfaction \r\nwith our political systems and calling on us to do things \r\ndifferently. Why would they not, when they themselves \r\nhave had to adapt so rapidly to a changing world?\r\nWithin a few short decades, we now have a generation \r\nthat will grow up more connected than ever before. \r\nDigital transformation will determine whether the jobs \r\nthey are training for will even exist in two decades. In \r\neducation or the job market, they will not just compete \r\nwith their neighbours but their neighbouring countries. \r\nThis generation is a borderless one, at least in a virtual \r\nsense, and its members increasingly see themselves as \r\nglobal citizens. As their reality changes, they expect \r\nthat ours will too, that we will see and understand our \r\ncollective impact and that we will change the way we \r\nuse our power.\r\nIf we are looking for an example of where the \r\nnext generation is calling on us to make that change, \r\nwe need look no further than climate change. Two \r\nweeks ago, Pacific Island leaders gathered together at \r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum. It was at that meeting, in \r\nthe small island nation of Nauru, that climate change \r\nwas declared the single biggest threat to security in \r\nthe Pacific. Please, just think about that for a moment. \r\nOf all the challenges we debate and discuss, rising sea \r\nlevels present the single biggest threat to our region.\r\nFor those who live in the South Pacific, the impacts \r\nof climate change are not academic, or even arguable. \r\nThey are watching the sea levels rise, the extreme \r\nweather events increase and the impact that has on \r\ntheir water supply and food crops. We can talk all we \r\nlike about the science and what it means and what \r\ntemperature rises we need to limit in order to survive, \r\nbut there is a grinding reality in hearing people from \r\na Pacific island talk about where the sea was when \r\nthey were children and the potential loss of their entire \r\nvillage now that they are adults.\r\nOur action in the wake of that global challenge \r\nremains optional, but the impact of inaction does \r\nnot. Nations like Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands or \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n54/59 18-30067\r\nKiribati — small countries that have contributed the \r\nleast to global climate change — are suffering, and will \r\nsuffer, the full force of a warming planet. If my Pacific \r\nneighbours do not have the option of opting out of the \r\neffects of climate change, why should we be able to opt \r\nout of taking action to stop it? Any disintegration of \r\nmultilateralism and any undermining of climate-related \r\ntargets and agreements are not interesting footnotes in \r\ngeopolitical history. They are catastrophic.\r\nIn New Zealand we are determined to play our \r\npart. We will not issue any further offshore oil and gas \r\nexploration permits. We have set a goal of 100 per cent \r\nrenewable energy generation by 2035, established a \r\ngreen infrastructure fund to encourage innovation and \r\nrolled out an initiative to plant 1 billion trees over the \r\nnext 10 years. Those plans are unashamedly ambitious. \r\nThe threat that climate change poses demands it. But \r\nwe represent less than 0.2 per cent of global emissions. \r\nThat is why, as a global community, not since the \r\ninception of the United Nations has there been a greater \r\nexample than climate change of the importance of \r\ncollective action and multilateralism. It should be a \r\nrallying cry for all of us.\r\nYet there is a hesitance that we can ill afford and a \r\ncalculation of personal cost and self-interest. But that \r\nis not the only challenge where domestic self-interest \r\nis the first response and where an international or \r\ncollective approach has been diluted at best, or rejected \r\nat worst. But it would be both unfair and naive to \r\nargue that retreating to our own borders and interests \r\nhas meant turning our backs on a perfect system. The \r\ninternational institutions that we have committed to \r\nhave not been perfect. But they can be fixed.\r\nThat is why the challenge I want to issue today \r\nis this: together, we must rebuild and recommit to \r\nmultilateralism. We must redouble our efforts to \r\nwork as a global community. We must rediscover our \r\nshared belief in the value, rather than the harm, of \r\nconnectedness. We must demonstrate that collective \r\ninternational action not only works but is in all of our \r\nbest interests. We must show the next generation that \r\nwe are listening and have heard them.\r\nBut if we are truly going to take on a reform \r\nagenda, we must acknowledge the failings that have led \r\nus to this crossroads. International trade, for instance, \r\nhas helped bring millions of people out of poverty \r\naround the world. But some have felt their standard of \r\nliving slide. We in New Zealand have ourselves seen \r\nthe hesitancy around trade agreements within our \r\nown population. The correct response is not to repeat \r\nthe mistakes of the past and be seduced by the false \r\npromises of protectionism. Rather, we must all work to \r\nensure that the benefits of trade are distributed fairly \r\nacross our societies.\r\nWe cannot rely on international institutions to do \r\nthat, in the same way that we cannot blame them if they \r\nhave not delivered those benefits. It is incumbent on us \r\nto build productive, sustainable and inclusive economies \r\nand demonstrate to our peoples that, when done right, \r\ninternational economic integration can make us all \r\nbetter off. If we want to ensure that everyone is better \r\noff, surely we should start with the most vulnerable.\r\nWe in New Zealand have set ourselves an \r\nambitious goal. We want to be the best place in the \r\nworld to be a child. It is hardly the stuff of hard and \r\nfast measures — after all, how are play and a feeling \r\nof security and happiness measured? But we can \r\nmeasure material deprivation and poverty, and so we \r\nwill. Moreover, we are making it a law that we report on \r\nthose numbers every single year alongside our budgets. \r\nWhat better way is there to hold ourselves to account, \r\nand what better group to do that for than children?\r\nBut if we are focused on nurturing that next \r\ngeneration, we equally have to worry about what it \r\nis that we are handing down to them, including our \r\nenvironment. In the Maori language there is a word \r\nthat captures the importance of that role, kaitiakitanga, \r\nwhich means guardianship. That is the idea that we have \r\nbeen entrusted with our environment and have a duty \r\nto care for it. For us, that has meant taking action to \r\naddress degradation, such as setting standards to make \r\nour rivers swimmable, reducing waste and phasing out \r\nsingle-use plastic bags, right through to eradicating \r\npredators and protecting our biodiversity. The race to \r\ngrow our economies and increase wealth makes us all \r\nthe poorer if it comes at the cost of our environment. \r\nWe in New Zealand are determined to prove that it does \r\nnot have to be that way. But those are all actions and \r\ninitiatives that we can take domestically that ease the \r\nblame and pressure on our international institutions. \r\nThat does not mean they do not need fixing.\r\nAt the heart of the multilateral system, the United \r\nNations must lead the way. We strongly support the \r\nSecretary-General’s reform efforts to make the United \r\nNations more responsive, effective and modernized so \r\nthat it is capable of dealing with today’s challenges. \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 55/59\r\nWe encourage him to be ambitious, and we stand \r\nwith him in that ambition. But ultimately it is up to \r\nus, the Member States, to drive change here at the \r\nUnited Nations. That includes reforming the Security \r\nCouncil. If we want the Council to fulfil its purpose \r\nof maintaining international peace and security, its \r\npractices must be updated so that it is not hamstrung by \r\nthe use of the veto.\r\nNew thinking will also be needed if we are to \r\nachieve the vision encapsulated in the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). In New Zealand we have \r\nsought to embed the principles behind the SDGs in \r\na new living-standards framework that is guiding \r\npolicymaking and the management of our resources. We \r\nremain absolutely committed to supporting the rollout \r\nof the SDGs alongside international partners through \r\na significant increase in our official development \r\nassistance budget.\r\nBut revitalizing our international rules-based \r\nsystem is not just about the mechanics of how we work \r\ntogether. It also means renewing our commitment to \r\nour values. The Charter of the United Nations recalls \r\nthat the Organization was formed to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, which after two \r\nworld wars had brought untold sorrow to humankind. If \r\nwe forget that history and the principles that drove the \r\ncreation of the United Nations, we will be doomed to \r\nrepeat the mistakes of the past.\r\nIn an increasingly uncertain world it is more \r\nimportant than ever that we remember the core values \r\non which the United Nations was built — that all people \r\nare equal, that all are entitled to have their dignity and \r\nhuman rights respected and that we must strive to \r\npromote social progress and better standards of life in \r\nlarger freedom. We must consistently hold ourselves to \r\naccount on each one.\r\nIn addition to renewing that commitment, though, \r\nwe must acknowledge where accountability must \r\ncontinue, and that is especially the case when it comes \r\nto equality. So many gains have been made, and each \r\nis worthy of celebration. In New Zealand we have just \r\nmarked the 125th year since women were granted the \r\nright to vote. We were the first country in the world to \r\ndo so. As a girl I never grew up believing that my gender \r\nwould stand in the way of my achieving whatever I \r\nwanted in life. I am, after all, not the first but the third \r\nfemale Prime Minister of New Zealand.\r\nBut for all of that, we still have a gender pay gap \r\nand an overrepresentation of women in low-paid work \r\nand as victims of domestic violence. And we are not \r\nalone. It seems surprising that in this modern age we \r\nshould have to recommit to gender equality, but we \r\ndo. I for one will never celebrate the gains we have \r\nmade for women domestically while internationally \r\nother women and girls experience a lack of the most \r\nbasic opportunities and dignity. #MeToo must become \r\n#WeToo. We are all in this together.\r\nI accept that the list of demands, whether domestic \r\nor international, on all of us is long. We are operating \r\nin challenging times. We face what we in New Zealand \r\nwould call wicked problems, ones that are intertwined \r\nand interrelated. Perhaps then it is time to step back \r\nfrom the chaos and ask what we want. It is in that space \r\nthat we will find simplicity, the simplicity of peace, \r\nprosperity and fairness.\r\nIf I could distil it into one concept that we are \r\npursuing in New Zealand it is simple and it is this: \r\nkindness. In the face of isolationism, protectionism \r\nand racism, the simple concept of looking outwardly \r\nand beyond ourselves and of kindness and collectivism \r\nmight be just as good a starting point as any. Let us \r\ntherefore start here, with the institutions that have \r\nserved us well in times of need and will do so again.\r\nIn the meantime, I can assure everyone here that \r\nNew Zealand remains committed to continuing to do its \r\npart in building and sustaining international peace and \r\nsecurity; promoting and defending an open, inclusive \r\nand rules-based international order based on universal \r\nvalues; and being pragmatic, empathetic, strong and \r\nkind. The next generation, after all, deserves no less.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, and National \r\nSecurity and Intelligence of New Zealand for the \r\nstatement she has just made.\r\nMs. Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Arts, Culture and Heritage, and National \r\nSecurity and Intelligence of New Zealand, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n56/59 18-30067\r\nAddress by Mr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Finance, the Public \r\nService, National Security, Legal Affairs and \r\nGrenadines Affairs of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nFinance, the Public Service, National Security, Legal \r\nAffairs and Grenadines Affairs of Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines.\r\nMr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nFinance, the Public Service, National Security, \r\nLegal Affairs and Grenadines Affairs of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Finance, the Public Service, \r\nNational Security, Legal Affairs and Grenadines Affairs \r\nof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nOne decade ago, the world was convulsed by a cataclysmic \r\ncollapse of its economic order. The devastating global \r\neconomic and financial crisis began in the boardrooms \r\nof greedy banks and spread worldwide, with a rapidity \r\nthat exposed the shortcomings of an unethical and \r\nunregulated international financial architecture. The \r\nadverse socioeconomic impact of the crisis has been \r\nvast and far-reaching, especially for the countries least \r\nresponsible for the genesis of the crisis.\r\nRegrettably, the seemingly self-evident lessons \r\nof that economic and financial catastrophe have been \r\ndistorted and manipulated to disastrous effect. While \r\nthe financial architecture has been quietly reassembled, \r\nwith little more than ineffectual cosmetic changes, \r\nthe post-crisis socioeconomic and political landscape \r\nhas been radically reordered. Economic difficulties \r\nhave caused most of the major nations to look inward, \r\neschewing the most noble and beneficial aspects of \r\nglobal cooperation. Craven demagogues, clothed in \r\npopulist robes, have emerged to exploit economic \r\nhardship and fan the f lames of division, hatred and \r\nisolation. In all corners of the globe, the jarring rise of \r\nilliberal intolerance can be causally connected to the \r\neconomic crisis and its continuing impact.\r\nSolidarity has been sacrificed on the altar of political \r\nexpediency, illustrating the enduring prescience of the \r\nlate Kofi Annan’s observation that when economic \r\nconditions are difficult, people tend to be less generous \r\nand protect themselves. The question of solidarity \r\ndoes not mean much to them at that time. We have \r\nretreated from the ethos of integration, cooperation \r\nand consensus-building that not only animated the \r\npre-crisis decade but is absolutely necessary to solve \r\nthe global problems that confront us.\r\nIn a technologically connected, increasingly \r\neducated and rapidly shrinking global village, any \r\nbelated attempt to put the genies of multilateralism \r\nand globalization back into their respective bottles is a \r\ndangerous folly. Walls cannot replace bridges, isolation \r\ncannot replace cooperation and clenched fists cannot \r\nshake hands.\r\nThe United Nations is not without its many \r\nsystemic f laws, and the ascendancy of its unprincipled \r\nantithesis demands that we address those f laws \r\nurgently. However, after seven decades, the United \r\nNations remains the world’s only institution with the \r\ncapacity and authority to enable global cooperation for \r\nour collective ennoblement.\r\nThe well-chosen theme for this general debate \r\nspeaks to the relevance of the United Nations, global \r\nleadership and shared responsibility. It centres on \r\na recommitment to the bedrock foundations of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations: sovereign equality, \r\nnon-interference and non-intervention, international \r\npeace and security, respect for international law and \r\ncollective cooperation in solving global problems. It is \r\nprecisely when times are most tumultuous and when \r\ndamaging changes are upon us that principles must be \r\nmost unwavering and fundamental truths must be most \r\nvigorously upheld.\r\nThe principles of non-intervention and \r\nnon-interference are of particular importance to small \r\nisland developing States. Lacking military might or \r\neconomic wealth, and constrained within narrow \r\nborders, we owe our existence as nation States to a \r\nglobal recognition and respect for the principle that \r\nno other nation — large or small, rich or poor, near or \r\nfar — should be allowed to interfere in our sovereign \r\naffairs or intervene in matters properly resident in our \r\ndomestic jurisdiction. Without strict adherence to those \r\ntenets, small States’ existence dangles precariously \r\non the threads of great-Power intrigue or changing \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 57/59\r\nperceptions of our strategic significance. Without those \r\nprinciples, our international order reverts to barbarism, \r\nin which the strong are doing what they can and the weak \r\nmerely suffering what they must. That is unacceptable.\r\nBecause of our undeniable reliance on that \r\ncornerstone of international law, small States are \r\namong its staunchest defenders. Every violation of the \r\nprinciple of non-intervention, wherever it may occur, is \r\nan indirect assault on our own survival. That principle \r\nis immutable, and no amount of heavy-handed coercion \r\nor ham-fisted inducements will cause us to abandon \r\nour overarching existential interests in pursuit of short-\r\nterm appeasement. Our shared history of struggle \r\nagainst colonial oppression and exploitation informs \r\nnot only our continuing pursuit of reparative justice for \r\nthe victims of native genocide and slavery, but places \r\nus in implacable opposition to any actions by those \r\nwho seek illegally to impose their will on independent \r\nnations and peoples.\r\nAs such, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines stands \r\nfirmly against the continued interventionist assaults on \r\nthe sovereignty of our neighbours in the Republic of \r\nCuba and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The \r\nanachronistic economic blockade of Cuba is both illegal \r\nand unproductive. The time has long since passed for \r\nits complete repeal. We regret deeply that the f ledgling \r\nrapprochement between the United States and Cuba \r\nhas stalled, and we call for a resumption of mutually \r\nrespectful dialogue between our two friends.\r\nIn Venezuela, the democratically elected Government \r\nhas been subjected to an unacceptable, coordinated \r\nand intense external economic assault that indirectly \r\nhas also had a debilitating effect on small Caribbean \r\nnations, which have had generous arrangements of \r\nsolidarity, through the PetroCaribe agreements, for \r\nexample. To be sure, Venezuela has enormous internal \r\nsociopolitical challenges, but unwarranted and illegal \r\nintervention is certainly counterproductive to the \r\npeople’s ongoing quest for peace, democracy and liberty. \r\nVenezuela needs a peace and reconciliation mission, \r\nnot a campaign of sanctions, subversion and threats \r\nof armed intervention. Constructive dialogue between \r\nand among the contending parties and personalities is \r\nurgently required.\r\nThe peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nhave repeatedly reaffirmed that our region is a zone of \r\npeace. Our peoples are not the pawns and playthings of \r\nany nation. Our America and our Caribbean defiantly \r\naffirm that. It is a noise in our blood, an echo in \r\nour bones.\r\nNo international organization is better suited than \r\nthe United Nations to fulfilling its foundational Charter \r\nmandate of achieving international cooperation in \r\nsolving international problems of an economic, social, \r\ncultural or humanitarian nature. Today, climate change \r\nis indisputably the defining, multifaceted existential \r\nproblem that we are collectively confronting. \r\nHowever, the prospects for an effective international \r\nsolution to climate change are rapidly receding. Our \r\ncarefully calibrated climate accords are teetering \r\non the brink of irrelevance, wounded not only by \r\nhigh-profile withdrawals but also by cynical and \r\nfoolhardy non-compliance with voluntary mitigation \r\npledges that major emitters have loudly declared but \r\nquietly disregarded.\r\nThe result of this ignoble hand-wringing and \r\npolitical procrastination is that the world continues to \r\nburn while its leaders fiddle. In the space of three years, \r\nour sister island of Dominica was twice devastated, by \r\nTropical Storm Erika and Hurricane Irma, with Tropical \r\nStorm Isaac striking that island a glancing blow only \r\nweeks ago. As I speak, the threat of a storm hangs over \r\nmy country. Beyond the headlines, the story of climate \r\nchange is grimly told in daily experiences of f loods, \r\ndroughts, landslides, coastal erosion and lost lives and \r\nlivelihoods across our region.\r\nWe can wait no longer. The constellation of \r\nchallenges, externally caused, that faces our small \r\nStates demands a focused global response that \r\nrecognizes an undoubted small State exceptionalism in \r\ntheory and in practice. The many-sided concept of small \r\nState exceptionalism ought to be placed at the centre \r\nof global discourse in order to prompt appropriate \r\ncollective action.\r\nThe rising seas and intensifying storms pose an \r\nexistential threat to small island developing States in \r\nparticular. Major emitters that fail to set and honour \r\nambitious mitigation pledges are committing a direct \r\nact of hostility against small island developing States, \r\nand we ought to resist their recklessness in acting \r\nagainst our interests.\r\nSimilarly, the financing of climate resilience and \r\nadaptation measures by our development partners \r\ncannot be shoehorned into the same glacially slow, \r\nlabyrinthine bureaucratic processes that have stymied \r\nother cooperation initiatives. Our friends and partners \r\nA/73/PV.10 27/09/2018\r\n58/59 18-30067\r\nmust recognize the fierce urgency of that unfamiliar and \r\nunprecedented climate threat and take decisive political \r\nand development action to arrest this extraordinary \r\nexistential problem. Climate change cannot be handled \r\nby business-as-usual practices, however tried and true. \r\nOur global climate accords have birthed entities with \r\nthe ostensible objectives of funnelling and delivering \r\nurgently needed mitigation and adaptation financing \r\nto the most vulnerable States. However, those entities \r\nplace the promised support at the centre of an \r\nimpenetrable web of unwieldy rules and processes that \r\nserve only to frustrate those most desperately in need \r\nof life-saving cooperation.\r\nSimilarly, the international commitment to the \r\nSustainable Development Goals falters on the paucity \r\nof tangible global effort to ensure their achievement \r\nand timeline. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals have been adopted \r\nand embedded within our national development plans. \r\nDespite limited resources, we have created both a \r\nzero-hunger trust fund and a disaster contingency \r\nfund, innovative and unique responses to our own \r\nsustainable development needs. We have mainstreamed \r\nand prioritized goals related to clean energy, economic \r\ngrowth, sustainability, climate action and biodiversity. \r\nWe have chalked up home-grown progress in tandem \r\nwith the self less solidarity of some of our regional and \r\nglobal friends and allies, but much more must be done.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines continues to \r\nseek new avenues for people-centred development \r\nand economic growth amid rapidly changing realities. \r\nThe spectre of trade wars poses an immense threat \r\nto our development aspirations, as does the continual \r\ntightening of the procedural noose around the throat \r\nof our banking and financial-services industries. The \r\nprospect of de-risking and the loss of correspondent \r\nbanking relationships is not an individual banking or \r\nbusiness decision but a clear and present threat to the \r\neconomic viability of many small States. The modern \r\nmanipulation of States’ access to global banking and \r\nfinance mechanisms, whether informed by politics, \r\nstigma or indifference, is a f lagrant violation of the \r\ninternationally recognized right to development. It \r\nis imperialism of a most insidious kind, imposed \r\nfacelessly from a distance. The United Nations must \r\nurgently confront that grave and gathering menace in a \r\ncoordinated and action-oriented manner.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is also making \r\nincreasingly innovative forays into capitalizing on \r\nthe vast potential of the blue economy, tourism, niche \r\nagricultural products and our historical knowledge in \r\nthe medical cannabis industry. We seek the cooperation \r\nof our friends and partners in supporting such initiatives.\r\nThe faith of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in \r\nthe principles and potential of the United Nations is \r\nmanifest in its active participation in all aspects of \r\nthis organ. In recent years, we have demonstrated that \r\nsmall size is no impediment to impactful contributions \r\non the world stage. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\nhas played a leadership role in the post-financial crisis \r\nresponse of the United Nations, the revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly, Security Council reform, the \r\nadvancement of the law of the sea, small-arms control, \r\nambitious measures to combat climate change and the \r\nglobal response to non-communicable diseases. Most \r\nrecently, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines chaired \r\nthe Administrative and Budgetary Committee of the \r\nUnited Nations and currently serves as President of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nIn a similar manner, we feel the responsibility to \r\nbring our unique perspectives to bear on the work of \r\nthe Security Council. The perspectives of small States, \r\nincluding small island developing States, have been \r\nhistorically the least heard in the Security Council. As \r\nthreats to international peace and security have evolved \r\nin diverse ways, so too has the need increased for a \r\ndiversity of viewpoints on the Security Council. Small \r\nisland States have largely and spectacularly solved the \r\nchallenge of forging peaceful, harmonious societies \r\namid many of the social, ethnic, political, historical \r\nand cultural fissures that traditionally lie at the root of \r\nmany breaches of international peace and security. We \r\nhave confronted those challenges not with a surfeit of \r\nweapons or dollars, but with mutual respect, dialogue \r\nand an understanding that unique situations require \r\nnot static ideological solutions, but f lexibility and \r\ninnovation geared towards the specificities of the issue \r\nat hand.\r\nThe need for more of that type of practical, \r\nprincipled pragmatism on the Security Council is self-\r\nevident. It is why the candidacy of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines has been endorsed by the States members \r\nof the Caribbean Community and why Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines continues to call for reform of the \r\nmembership of the Security Council to reflect modern \r\nrealities and challenges.\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.10\r\n18-30067 59/59\r\nOur pragmatism affords us the opportunity to \r\nsee the world as it is, unencumbered by historical or \r\nideological blinders. The United Nations, which justly \r\ncounts States with populations as small as 10,000 people \r\namong its Members, somehow continues to remain \r\nblind to the 23 million residents of Taiwan. There is \r\nsimply no principled basis to deny Taiwan the right to \r\nparticipate in the work of the specialized agencies of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe relevance of this institution is rooted in \r\nits responsiveness to the needs and challenges of \r\nthe peoples we collectively represent. We can and \r\nmust do more to address those needs in direct and \r\ntransformative ways. We must ever more diligently \r\nwork to match noble intent with decisive action in \r\npursuit of our Charter objectives. Accordingly, we urge \r\nthe practical resolution of the pain and suffering of the \r\nPalestinians, the people of Yemen and those aff licted \r\nby the evil of terrorism, whether State-sponsored or \r\nnot. Similarly, the madness of the spread of weapons \r\nof mass destruction and the threat of their use is a \r\nstanding affront to humanity, peace and security, and \r\ntherefore demands our continued collective response. \r\nOur international agenda for corrective action also \r\nincludes trafficking in persons, illegal drugs and small \r\narms, refugees from ravaged lands, violence against \r\nwomen and children, the growing scarcity of water \r\nand food in many nations, the war against chronic \r\nnon-communicable diseases, the rising tide of religious \r\nintolerance in certain places and the reunification of \r\nfamilies arising from abductions of yesteryear.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nWe live amid frantic attempts in diverse quarters \r\nto rekindle the dying embers of xenophobia and \r\nunilateralism in pursuit of a past glory stuffed with \r\nmythology. But this noble institution is the keeper of \r\na different f lame. Our bedrock principles stand as an \r\nopen rebuke to those who traffic in base triumphalism \r\nand pursue actions that are fueled by both short \r\nmemories and short-sightedness. Ours is a f lame of \r\nrespect for sovereignty, diversity of views, dialogue, \r\npeace and development. In changing times, and amid \r\nnew challenges, the principles that fuel that f lame \r\nmust be zealously defended. As keepers of that f lame \r\nand as holders of those principles in trust for future \r\ngenerations, we cannot falter and be found wanting \r\nin the face of reactionary assaults. Another way is \r\npossible, and that way, that path, is lit by the timeless \r\nprinciples that continue to animate and invigorate the \r\nbest efforts of the United Nations. Long may those \r\nprinciples continue to guide our collective journey of \r\npeace, prosperity and people-centred development.\r\nWhat, then, is required of us? The answer is as \r\ntimeless as it is wise. What is required of is to do justly, \r\nto love mercy and to work humbly with our God.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, \r\nMinister for Finance, the Public Service, National \r\nSecurity, Legal Affairs and Grenadines Affairs of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nFinance, the Public Service, National Security, \r\nLegal Affairs and Grenadines Affairs of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.05 p.m.\r\n"
