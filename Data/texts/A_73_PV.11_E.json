"United Nations A/73/PV.11\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n11th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 27 September 2018, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 4.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Peter Christian, President and \r\nHead of Government of the Federated States \r\nof Micronesia\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Federated States of Micronesia.\r\nMr. Peter Christian, President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Federated States of Micronesia, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Peter Christian, \r\nPresident and Head of Government of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Christian: The two speakers whom the \r\nAssembly heard this afternoon immediately before \r\nme have said it all for me and my country (see A/73/\r\nPV.10). The fact is that I do not have to say a word here, \r\nbecause they said it so well. But I am bound by duty \r\nto my country to say a few words in order to justify \r\nthe cost of my trip to New York. I know that everyone \r\nis tired, and I know that it is afternoon, but I ask the \r\nAssembly to bear with me.\r\nThe Organization needs good leadership, and I am \r\nsure that you will take us in the right direction, Madam \r\nPresident. I offer my congratulations to you and to the \r\npeople of Ecuador on your election to lead us during \r\nthis session of the General Assembly.\r\nAs I said before, New Zealand has spoken eloquently \r\nabout the fate of the Pacific island countries in the face \r\nof the imminent threat of climate change.\r\nWhen the armed conflicts that dominated the world \r\nin the first four decades of the previous century ended, \r\nthe world slipped into another war, the Cold War. It was \r\na period of suspicion and deceit, an era deeply rooted \r\nin clandestine engagement that reminds us of what \r\nWinston Churchill once said: “[T]ruth is so precious \r\nshe should always be attended by a bodyguard of \r\nlies.” That resonates with us today, given the various \r\napplications of that term. We see the fight continuing \r\ntoday, but it is now waged between the bigger and richer \r\nnations, armed with the might of wealth and guided by \r\nthe principle and the notion that might makes right. The \r\nsmaller economies are now aligned and marginalized, \r\nonce again becoming the spoils of what is now an \r\neconomic war fostering new, economic colonies. As in \r\nall wars, many people become innocent victims and are \r\noften filed away simply as collateral damage or spoils of \r\nwar, becoming the possessions of the victors and allies.\r\nWe are opening another session of the General \r\nAssembly with our world facing record and serious \r\nchallenges. And yet, we dared to ask ourselves this \r\nmorning whether Pluto was a planet. How is that \r\nrelevant to what we face today in the world? Perhaps \r\nPluto can wait.\r\nOur aim today must be to improve upon the United \r\nNations as the forum in which we work to prevent all \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

We must seek curative measures \r\nto slow and, if possible, stop the economic war, \r\nhopefully with the goal of accelerating efforts to close \r\nthe gap of economic imbalance. We must also avoid \r\ndeliberate procrastination motivated by geopolitical \r\ngreed for dominance and economic imperialism. Such \r\na state only brings pain and misery to those whose only \r\nfault is to be in the way. We must recommend what the \r\nfuture should hold for us.\r\nWe the Members of the United Nations must adopt \r\na more progressive attitude towards taking charge of \r\nour own affairs and making sure that we are directly \r\ninvolved in matters that touch and impact our lives. \r\nThe existential threat of climate change is becoming \r\nmore real with every hurricane, wildfire, heatwave and \r\ncentimetre of sea-level rise. Those are the realities that \r\nmany of us are seeing and experiencing. Islands within \r\nthe Federated States, islands in Marshall Islands, and \r\nislands in Tuvalu and Kiribati will be among the first to \r\nliterally disappear.\r\nIn 2009, Micronesia proposed a fast-action strategy \r\nusing the Montreal Protocol to explicitly cut climate \r\nemissions so as to avoid a warming of 1.5°C by the end \r\nof the century. While it may sound like a small figure, \r\nit is 50 per cent more than the warming that we are \r\nexperiencing today. In order to achieve that goal, we \r\nurge all countries that have not yet done so to ratify the \r\nKigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. I ask all \r\nmy friends, leaders of their countries, from the bottom \r\nof my heart to accelerate the process to join the Montreal \r\nProtocol so that we can begin the implementation of \r\nwhat needs to be done in order to save this planet.\r\nOn our current trajectory, many more islands will \r\nbe lost, many homes will be destroyed and many people \r\nwill be displaced. But we can still avoid the worst \r\nclimate impacts if we recognize the need for speed \r\nand take fast action. The Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange may have shortcomings, but believe me, it is \r\nthe best platform for achieving our goal. We believe \r\nthat, no matter how difficult or sensitive the issues \r\nassociated with climate change, we need everyone on \r\nboard. My country is disappointed that some countries \r\nare considering withdrawing from the Agreement, and \r\nwe call on them to reconsider.\r\nMicronesia is a large ocean State blessed with \r\nabundant marine resources. A key concern for \r\nMicronesia — and all small island developing States — is \r\nrightly focused on ensuring a healthy, productive and \r\nresilient ocean. The resources of the ocean are the \r\nbedrock of the Micronesian nations and livelihoods. A \r\nsizeable percentage of our economies comes from our \r\nocean-based activities, whether fisheries, tourism or \r\nmaritime transport.\r\nMicronesia is committed to the Pacific Islands \r\nForum leaders’ declaration aimed at safeguarding \r\nthe ocean and its resources. I join my fellow Pacific \r\nleaders as we commit to eliminating marine litter \r\nand recommend the urgent implementation of the \r\nPacific marine litter action plan. For Micronesia, our \r\nfisheries are critical to the socioeconomic well-being \r\nof our people.\r\nWhile we welcome the recent decision by the \r\nInternational Law Commission to place the topic “Sea-\r\nLevel Rise in Relation to International Law” on its long-\r\nterm programme of work, may I strongly recommend \r\nthat the subject be placed on the Commission’s active \r\nprogramme of work, given the direct implications \r\nof sea-level rise on maritime baselines and \r\nmaritime boundaries.\r\nThe wish for peace is global; it should have no \r\nboundaries. Micronesia is encouraged by the peace \r\nreached by Eritrea and Ethiopia, and we wish the people \r\nof those countries the very best. I think that it is time \r\nthat we congratulate those countries on achieving that \r\nwonderful result. We also hope that other countries that \r\nare engaged in conflicts achieve similar resolutions, \r\nand soon.\r\nIn our region of the world, we have a stake in the \r\nongoing peace negotiations between the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. \r\nWe recognize and encourage the continuing efforts to \r\nbring peace and stability to the Korean peninsula. A \r\nlasting peace on the peninsula translates into a more \r\nsecure and stable Pacific region.\r\nElsewhere in the world, we cannot ignore the pain \r\nand suffering of the  many people caught in pockets of \r\narmed conflict. As world leaders, we have fallen short \r\nin our efforts to fulfil our responsibilities. It is deeply \r\ntroubling to see those who wield tremendous power fail \r\nto take bold and decisive actions to end such serious \r\natrocities. We wonder if, for some unknown reason, \r\nsuch conflicts might be good for those powerful States, \r\neither politically or even economically — what a shame \r\nif they were to think so.\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 3/61\r\nThe United Nations needs to be relevant and able \r\nand willing to deal with emerging threats. We find it \r\ndeeply troubling that the threat posed by climate change \r\nto our existence has not received the Security Council’s \r\nconsideration. The Pacific small island developing \r\nStates have made a proposal for consideration by the \r\nCouncil. While the proposal itself will not immediately \r\nsave our islands, it is nevertheless a step in the right \r\ndirection. I happen to feel that if Micronesia were a \r\nmember of the Security Council, we would do a lot better \r\nthan some of the current ones. Micronesia believes that \r\na Security Council, as conceived in this century, needs \r\nto become more efficient, more representative and \r\nmore responsive and must show greater leadership in \r\nits response to today’s challenges.\r\nMicronesia welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\nobjective to reposition the United Nations development \r\nsystem in order to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. The United Nations \r\ndevelopment system has impact and influence when \r\nit is focused. It is of the utmost importance that its \r\noperational activities for development take into account \r\nthe need to build, promote and strengthen the capacities \r\nof small island developing countries.\r\nFor Micronesia, the role of the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system — and particularly the United \r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) — to \r\nsupport and enhance the capacity of island countries \r\nto implement the 2030 Agenda must not be overlooked. \r\nHowever, that requires the scaling up of the UNDP \r\npresence, particularly in our North Pacific, where that \r\npresence can make a real difference and be a crucial \r\nfactor in our development efforts.\r\nIn closing, the United Nations represents the best \r\nhope for humankind, and we, the Member States, must \r\nensure that it remains so.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nand Head of Government of the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Peter Christian, President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Federated States of Micronesia, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. José Mário Vaz, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau.\r\nMr. José Mário Vaz, President of the Republic of \r\nGuinea-Bissau, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. José Mário \r\nVaz, President of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vaz (spoke in Portuguese; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): First of all, I would like to \r\nsay a few words to Her Excellency Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés and congratulate her on her election \r\nas the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session. I assure you, Madam President, that \r\nyou can count on the full cooperation of my country, \r\nGuinea-Bissau, in performing your important duties. I \r\nwould also like to thank your predecessor, Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák, for his excellent work during his term. \r\nFurthermore, I would like to highlight the work \r\nof our current Secretary-General, Mr. António \r\nGuterres, in particular his innovative leadership of \r\nthe Secretariat and the new momentum that he has \r\ninstilled in the Organization to better face global \r\nchallenges and strengthen multilateralism. His vision \r\nof the Organization’s unifying role in affirming and \r\napplying the principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and the collective responsibility of \r\nevery Member State for the establishment of lasting \r\nglobal peace strengthen our conviction that, under his \r\nleadership, the United Nations will be better prepared \r\nfor and more capable of contributing to the advent of a \r\nmore just and equitable world in the coming years.\r\nOn 24 September we celebrated the 100th birthday \r\nof President Nelson Mandela — Madiba — and had the \r\nopportunity to reflect on the life and accomplishments \r\nof that great humanist (see A/73/PV.5). The late former \r\nSouth African President was an example of courage, \r\nabnegation and tolerance. Mandela fought for freedom, \r\njustice, democracy and a society in which all people \r\nmight live together as equals in harmony. That is a \r\ngreat lesson that will continue to serve as a source of \r\ninspiration for us and future generations.\r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n4/61 18-30073\r\nIn his latest report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/73/1), the Secretary-General reminds us that, for \r\nmany peoples, peace remains a difficult goal to achieve. \r\nAs our much-missed former Secretary-General, the late \r\nKofi Annan, said, peace is a suspended dream. Many \r\nconflicts persist around the world, and many people \r\ncontinue to suffer the destruction brought on by war, \r\nMany have been killed, including children. Millions \r\nof people have been forced to abandon their homes \r\nand their cities, leaving behind their families and the \r\npossessions they acquired through a lifetime of work, \r\nin search of asylum. We cannot remain indifferent to \r\nthe suffering and despair of the thousands of people, \r\nincluding children, seeking protection and asylum, \r\nparticularly in Europe.\r\nThe situation in Palestine, as well as in Yemen and \r\nSyria, continues to be a source of great concern for the \r\ninternational community. On the African continent, \r\ninternal tensions caused by the activities of terrorist \r\ngroups persist, particularly in the Sahel, spreading fear \r\namong populations and preventing their Governments \r\nfrom focusing on development and on creating the best \r\npossible living conditions for their citizens.\r\nClimate change has caused an increasing number of \r\nsevere droughts and f loods in many parts of the world. \r\nMany island countries face the risk of disappearing, \r\nowing to rising sea levels. Those challenges require \r\ngreater efforts, new attitudes and increasingly \r\nresponsible behaviour on the part of all of us. Above all, \r\nwe must rigorously meet the commitments stipulated in \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\r\nI believe that we all have an obligation under the \r\nCharter, to which we all subscribe, and that we must \r\nrespect it regardless of the circumstances, because the \r\nprinciples enshrined therein are the foundation and basis \r\nfor a rules-based world order. Specifically, the principle \r\nof the peaceful resolution of disputes, non-interference \r\nin the internal affairs of States and multilateralism are \r\nthe cornerstone for building international peace and \r\nsecurity. We live in a global village in which we all are \r\nresponsible not only for what happens within our own \r\nterritories, but, given the interdependence of countries, \r\none country’s national policies may gravely affect many \r\nother countries. That requires shared responsibility. \r\nIn that regard, I would be remiss if I did not address \r\nthe issue of Security Council reform, particularly with \r\nregard to the increased representation of the African \r\ncontinent, which would enhance the legitimacy of that \r\nprincipal United Nations organ.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to briefly \r\nupdate the Assembly on the current political situation \r\nin Guinea-Bissau, as well as the results achieved. \r\nLast April, in Lomé, Togo, within the framework of \r\nan extraordinary summit convened by the Heads of \r\nState and Government of the Economic Community \r\nof West African States, we reached an important \r\ndecision aimed at permanently overcoming the political \r\nand constitutional impasse that has prevailed in my \r\ncountry for more than three years. As Head of State \r\nand in order to build peace and stability in my country \r\nand the subregion, I have sought to implement the \r\nrecommendations that resulted from the summit, namely, \r\nthe appointment of a consensus Prime Minister and the \r\nscheduling of a date for holding legislative elections, \r\nnamely, 18 November. Those recommendations have \r\nbeen fully implemented, with the following results: the \r\nformation of a Government of inclusion in accordance \r\nwith the Conakry Agreement; the reopening of our \r\nNational People’s Assembly; the extension of the terms \r\nof Assembly members; the election of the members of \r\nthe National Electoral Commission; and the approval \r\nof the Government programme and the general \r\nState budget.\r\nRecent political, social, and economic events bear \r\nwitness to the fact that the people of Guinea-Bissau, \r\ntogether with our armed forces, said “no” to instability \r\nand embarked upon a path of peace and development. The \r\nprocess for the holding of our elections on 18 November \r\nis under way, and we began registering voters on \r\n19 September, despite delays due to technical and \r\nfinancial issues. Please note that, for the first time in the \r\nhistory of our democracy, a legislative session has been \r\ncompleted without any interruptions caused by coups \r\nd’état or other incidents. Accordingly, on 30 August, \r\nthe Security Council noted (see S/PV.8337) the positive \r\ndevelopments concerning the political stability in our \r\ncountry. I also note that in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (S/2018/771), as in his previous reports, we \r\nwere commended on the republican attitudes of the \r\narmed forces, which have displayed a notable sense of \r\ncivic duty in recent years. In the name of justice and \r\nnational harmony, I take this opportunity to appeal to \r\nthe international community and to the members of the \r\nSecurity Council, of which sanctions are the exclusive \r\nprerogative, to lift the sanctions imposed on officials of \r\nour armed forces. That long-anticipated decision would \r\ncertainly help consolidate our democratic institutions \r\nand bring about lasting peace in our country.\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 5/61\r\nPeace is essential for successful development, \r\nbut peace is not just the absence of armed conflict. \r\nThere can be no peace when a large portion, if not the \r\nmajority, of the population, particularly women and \r\nyouth, are not sufficiently valued; when their education \r\nis considered less important; when their contribution to \r\nthe economic growth of our country is not recognized \r\nor fairly compensated; or when women are not on par \r\nwith men in positions of influence and are ignored as \r\nthe pillar of society. We recently took significant steps \r\nin my country towards ensuring equal representation \r\nfor men and women. The Parliament of Guinea-\r\nBissau adopted a law that guarantees a minimum \r\nrepresentation quota of 36 per cent for women in high-\r\nprofile positions, particularly in the National People’s \r\nAssembly and the Government. As President of the \r\nRepublic and guarantor of national equity and unity, \r\nI am particularly pleased by and grateful for those \r\nnational advances.\r\nI would like to conclude my remarks by reaffirming \r\nGuinea-Bissau’s commitment to the principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to \r\nthe important, unique and irreplaceable role played by \r\nthe Organization. We must join forces to better manage \r\nglobalization, eradicate poverty and hunger, and \r\ncombat major endemic diseases, as well as to ensure \r\neducation and the provision of potable water for all in \r\norder to implement the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nby 2030. Let us stand in solidarity and demonstrate our \r\ncompassion for those who are f leeing persecution, war \r\nand misery, particularly migrants and refugees who are \r\nvictims of political crises and natural catastrophes and \r\nare desperately knocking on our doors. In a solidary \r\nand brotherly world, we will be in a better position to \r\nbuild a better future for future generations.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nGuinea-Bissau for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. José Mário Vaz, President of the Republic of \r\nGuinea-Bissau, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Azali Assoumani, President of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The General \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Union of the Comoros.\r\nMr. Azali Assoumani, President of the Union \r\nof the Comoros, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Excellency Mr. Azali Assoumani, \r\nPresident of the Union of the Comoros, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Assoumani (spoke in French): First, \r\nI extend my warm congratulations to you, Madam \r\nPresident, on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session. Your \r\nelection as the fourth woman to be elected to lead the \r\nAssembly represents a further step towards the better \r\nrepresentation of women within our Organization, and \r\nI am convinced that the breadth of your well-grounded \r\nexperience will benefit our work and provide the energy \r\nneeded to move forward more effectively towards the \r\nachievement of our goals. I am exceptionally pleased \r\nthat my Government has made the advancement of \r\nwomen one of its priorities. I would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to commend and thank your predecessor \r\nupon the completion of his term; he deserves my \r\ndelegation’s gratitude for his remarkable commitment \r\nduring the previous session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe year 2018 has seen upheavals, transitions, \r\nchanges and many instances of disorder in manifold \r\nforms, in the face of which we must continue to show \r\nour resolve and unity. Whether climatic, economic, \r\nsocial, political, migratory, health-related or other \r\nin nature, those events must further mobilize the \r\ninternational community, which must become more \r\nsolidary, committed and determined than ever. The \r\ncurrent international context is increasingly demanding \r\nand requires that we react virtually immediately. The \r\ninvolvement of us all is therefore essential, given that \r\nall those situations can compromise peace and stability. \r\nThat is what genuinely confers upon the United Nations \r\nits universality.\r\nThe theme chosen for the seventy-third \r\nsession — “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies” — will \r\nmake sense only if we translate our words into action. \r\nToday there is a need for shared responsibility. In \r\norder to meet all the challenges we face, we must \r\nbegin by making the Organization more equitable and \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n6/61 18-30073\r\neffective by providing it with the resources necessary \r\nto accomplish its mission.\r\nTo that end, the much-desired reforms, \r\nparticularly within the main organs of the United \r\nNations — which, when delayed, give rise to a sense \r\nof injustice and frustration among the regions that \r\nfeel least represented —  must be concrete in order \r\nto reflect, as closely and in the most balanced way \r\npossible, the current geopolitical realities, especially \r\nthe recognition of the African continent. In that regard, \r\nthe Union of the Comoros reiterates its support for the \r\nEzulwini Consensus, which calls for the allocation of \r\nat least two permanent seats to Africa in the Security \r\nCouncil, with veto power.\r\nBy having equal opportunities to invest in \r\nthe areas of peace and security, health, education, \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law, we will succeed in \r\nensuring the harmonious development of our countries \r\nand in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nthe founding objective of the new era in which the \r\nOrganization is entering.\r\nMy country also welcomes the relevance of the \r\nSecretary-General’s proposals as part of the reforms he \r\nis undertaking, which will better reflect the priorities \r\nand needs of countries and improve the functioning \r\nof the Organization. On the other hand, that rationale \r\nmust in no way decrease the presence of the United \r\nNations on the ground. It is therefore important to \r\nstress that care must be taken to ensure that funding is \r\npredictable and that the poorest countries, in particular \r\nsmall island developing States, do not assume too great \r\nof a financial burden.\r\nI would like to welcome the initiative taken by \r\nthe Assembly to attach particular importance to the \r\nconsideration of topics relating to tuberculosis and \r\nnon-communicable diseases. Need I remind those \r\npresent that some of those diseases are no longer the \r\nprerogative of the poorest countries, in the sense that \r\nthey are reappearing in the more aff luent countries? \r\nWe must strengthen the World Health Organization’s \r\nwork in the world, including by making substantial \r\nresources available to the agency. At the country level, \r\nwe must assign importance to those problems and \r\nadopt appropriate and effective strategies to combat \r\nthose diseases.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East is extremely \r\nworrisome. Yemen, Syria and Palestine need the \r\nOrganization’s unwavering support. In that regard, \r\nI would like to express the deep concern of my \r\nGovernment and of the Comorian people over the \r\nincrease in arbitrary measures taken in recent months \r\nagainst the Palestinian people, the consequences of \r\nwhich not only significantly undermine the stability of \r\nthe region but also weaken the collective effort towards \r\na two-State solution.\r\nThat is why the Union of the Comoros reiterates its \r\nsteadfast support for the Palestinian people and remains \r\nconvinced that any viable solution to that conflict must \r\ninvolve the creation of both an Israeli and a Palestinian \r\nState, living side by side, in complete security, within \r\nsecure and internationally recognized borders, on the \r\nbasis of the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as \r\nPalestine’s capital.\r\nHowever, our concern is all the more justified as we \r\nnote that, unfortunately, the international community \r\nhas gradually become a spectator of that peace process, \r\nwhich is stuck in a persistent stalemate that is likely to \r\ndecrease the prospects for a just and lasting resolution. \r\nIn view of recent events and positions, Member States \r\nmust spend some time in reflection so as to reach \r\nconsensus on developing a new mediation mechanism \r\nto finally relaunch the peace process.\r\nIn that regard, I welcome the adoption, in \r\nDecember 2017, of resolution ES-10/19, on the status \r\nof Jerusalem, as well as resolution ES-10/20, on \r\nthe protection of the Palestinian people, which was \r\nadopted in June by a majority of Member States and \r\nrequests that the Secretary-General submit proposals \r\nto ensure the security, protection and well-being of the \r\nPalestinian population, in addition to recommendations \r\non an international protection mechanism for \r\nPalestinian civilians.\r\nIn that vein, allow me to draw the attention of the \r\nmembers of the Assembly to the difficult situation that \r\nthe Rohingya people continue to face. That innocent \r\npopulation is the target of attacks and persecutions \r\nthat contravene the values enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. To that end, I would like to \r\nmake a solemn appeal to the Assembly to assume its \r\nresponsibilities in order to help that population, which \r\nis in great danger.\r\nWith regard to the question of Western Sahara, \r\nwhile we welcome the adoption by the Security Council \r\nof resolution 2414 (2018), which stresses the need to \r\nwork towards a pragmatic, realistic and lasting political \r\nsolution and calls on neighbouring States to cooperate \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 7/61\r\nfully with the United Nations, the Union of the Comoros \r\nwishes to express its thanks to the Secretary-General \r\nand his Special Envoy for succeeding in relaunching \r\nthe political process on the basis of the parameters \r\ndefined by the Security Council since 2007. The Union \r\nof the Comoros welcomes the serious and creditable \r\nefforts of the Kingdom of Morocco to find a definitive \r\npolitical solution and supports the Moroccan initiative \r\nfor autonomy.\r\nBuilding international peace and security is a \r\nconstant struggle and the result of many concessions. \r\nIn the current context, the risks of a nuclear detonation \r\nare very real. We have a duty to protect present and \r\nfuture generations from the danger of the use of \r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nThe terrorist threat also continues to grow \r\nworldwide, and no country has been spared. Indeed, \r\nnot a day goes by without there being victims \r\nsomewhere in the world, owing to the madness of \r\ncertain malicious people who use ideologies of all \r\nkinds to achieve their extremist ends and commit \r\nacts of unspeakable barbarity. Some say that they are \r\nacting in the name of Islam. That is entirely wrong. \r\nWhat Islam are they referring to? Islam, our Islam, is \r\na religion of peace and tolerance. It is therefore urgent \r\nto work together to strengthen mobilization efforts, in \r\nparticular through information-sharing and the transfer \r\nof skills, to be able to effectively stamp out that threat.\r\nTo that end, sustained efforts must continue to be \r\nmade with a view to achieving a common consensual \r\nlanguage, which, beyond defining the various aspects of \r\nthe terrorism spectrum, will enable the establishment of \r\ncooperation processes and action aimed at reducing the \r\nthreat of terrorism at the national, regional and global \r\nlevels. We must therefore support the Group of Five \r\nfor the Sahel, the United Nations forces and Operation \r\nBarkhane in their joint efforts to fight terrorism in the \r\nSahel region.\r\nSince it is equally necessary to find prompt and \r\nurgent solutions to the many situations of injustice that \r\npersist in the world, we must give priority to exchanges \r\nand do more to prevent such situations from arising. \r\nWhy should we not become more involved in finding \r\nways and means to deal with sensitive issues, such as \r\nmigration, with humanity and celerity?\r\nIn that regard, the Union of the Comoros, through \r\nthe coordination of the Group of African States, \r\ncontributed to the negotiations on the landmark \r\ndocument promoting the global compact for safe, \r\norderly and regular migration, the first document \r\noffering a 360-degree perspective on migration \r\ngovernance and the first internationally recognized \r\nnormative and regulatory framework in the area of \r\nmigration governance.\r\nThe global compact reiterates our commitment to \r\naddressing socioeconomic causes and determinants, \r\nincluding through international cooperation, as well as \r\nour obligation to protect the human rights of migrants \r\nand promote the fight against all forms of racism and \r\ndiscrimination against them. Among other things, the \r\ncompact advocates voluntary migration and recognizes \r\nthe positive contribution of migrants and diasporas to \r\nsustainable development in countries of origin, transit \r\nand destination.\r\nIn order to ensure a safer world, we must also pay \r\nclose attention to the ever-growing issue of climate \r\nchange, particularly in small island developing States, \r\nof which my country, the Union of the Comoros, is one. \r\nWhile exacerbating the destruction of ecosystems and \r\nbiodiversity, climate change is also likely to increase \r\npoverty and various diseases and lead to an upsurge in \r\nclimate-related migration, thereby compromising our \r\nfuture and that of future generations.\r\nAt the national level, major events marking a \r\ndecisive turning point in the sociopolitical evolution \r\nof my country have taken place this year that merit \r\nbeing brought to the attention of the Assembly. As I \r\nannounced in my statement at the United Nations last \r\nyear (see A/72/PV.13), we held a national conference \r\nin February of this year to take stock of the 42 years \r\nof independence of the Union of the Comoros. That \r\ncivil-society-driven initiative benefited not only from \r\nthe support of the Government but also from the \r\nmultifaceted support of development partners and many \r\nregional and international organizations, including \r\nthe African Union, the League of Arab States, the \r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie and the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI would like to reiterate my sincere appreciation to \r\nthe Secretary-General for sending senior officials to the \r\nopening and closing of the conference. The conclusions \r\ndrawn from that national forum highlighted the need \r\nto redefine and redesign a new institutional framework \r\nthat would, while consolidating national unity, pave the \r\nway for the emergence of a new Comoros by 2030. A \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n8/61 18-30073\r\nreferendum was held on 30 July, and a new Constitution \r\nwas adopted.\r\nIn full support of that reform process willed by the \r\nComorian people, I have decided to shorten my term of \r\noffice and to prepare, under the new Constitution and \r\nthe established deadlines, early regional and national \r\nelections. In that connection, I solemnly appeal to our \r\ndevelopment partners and all the countries that are \r\nfriends of the Comoros to support us in meeting that \r\nnew challenge of the future. I remain confident that, as \r\nusual, their valuable support will be be forthcoming to \r\nensure that future elections will be conducted in peace, \r\nharmony and transparency.\r\nWith regard to the Comorian island of Mayotte, \r\npopular uprisings there in March led the authorities \r\non that island to massively expel Comorians from the \r\nother three islands who were residing on Mayotte. The \r\nconditions of their refoulement forced my Government \r\nto oppose that unilateral decision, especially since \r\nmany of those people are adolescents who have become \r\nstreet children since their families were driven out of \r\nMayotte under the same conditions that we denounce \r\ntoday. Since their parents’ refoulement from Mayotte \r\nwithout any care, those abandoned children pose a real \r\nthreat today not only to the island but also to the rest of \r\nthe archipelago, and even to the whole region.\r\nThe misunderstanding between France and the \r\nUnion of the Comoros originates from that situation, \r\nwhich is compounded by the shock felt by the \r\nComorians of the other three islands at seeing the \r\ndifficult conditions of detention of their fellow citizens \r\non Mayotte. The Government is committed to engaging \r\nin dialogue with France to resolve everything that \r\nputs us at odds, or has the potential to do so. We are \r\na peaceful country by nature, despite the many bumps \r\nthat have marked our shared history. We have historical \r\nand cultural links with France. For that reason, we are \r\ndetermined to move forward towards a successful and \r\njust solution to that problem.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to pay warm \r\ntribute to the people of the Comoros as a whole for the \r\nunanimity and solidarity they have shown in relation \r\nto the Government’s position in that new twist on \r\nthe Mayotte issue. We have utilized active, measured \r\nand effective diplomacy to take due account of all the \r\ndimensions of the issue. I welcome the commitment of \r\nComorians, alongside the Government, which is making \r\nevery effort to ensure that, together with France, we can \r\nresolve the current unfortunate situation on the basis of \r\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nTo close that chapter, I trust that, together with \r\nFrance’s top officials, we can find a lasting solution to \r\nthat very troublesome dispute between partners, which \r\nhas lasted far too long for two countries that should be \r\nunited by many factors, as confirmed by the late French \r\nPresident François Mitterrand.\r\nOn that question, as on the others that are the \r\nsubject of our debate here, our responsibility is to \r\nprovide answers, because in the Indian Ocean, Africa \r\nand throughout the world our duty is to leave future \r\ngenerations with a world of peace, stability and \r\nsustainable development. I want to believe that we can \r\ndo it.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Union of the Comoros for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Azali Assoumani, President of the Union of \r\nthe Comoros, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Rivo Rakotovao, President ad \r\ninterim of the Republic of Madagascar\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President ad interim of \r\nthe Republic of Madagascar.\r\nMr. Rivo Rakotovao, President ad interim of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Excellency Mr. Rivo Rakotovao, \r\nInterim President of the Republic of Madagascar, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rakotovao (spoke in French): If I have \r\nthe privilege and honour to speak today on behalf of \r\nthe Malagasy people before the General Assembly, \r\nit is because Madagascar has gone through a period \r\nof exceptional democratic success, which has been \r\nwarmly welcomed by many observers and seen as “real \r\ndemocratic progress”, to use the words said on that \r\noccasion. I will come back to that later.\r\nI extend to you, Madam President, my sincere \r\ncongratulations on your election. I am confident that your \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 9/61\r\ndetermination will give new impetus to our collective \r\nefforts to consolidate our Organization with a view to \r\nmaking it even more credible and closer to our peoples \r\nand capable of effecting real change in their daily lives, \r\nbecause that is its mission. We have also heard your call \r\nand that of the Secretary-General for the strengthening \r\nof multilateralism and international cooperation in the \r\ncurrent difficult context of fragmentation, polarization \r\nand withdrawal. Be assured that Madagascar will \r\nactively support you throughout your mandate.\r\nMadagascar, strongly committed to the values of \r\nunity, fraternity and peace advocated by the United \r\nNations, intends, like all of us here who are striving to \r\npromote the welfare of our peoples, to contribute to the \r\nmost representative and democratic platform for global \r\nexchange, namely, the General Assembly. All the \r\nspeakers who have taken the f loor in succession have \r\nhighlighted the transformations taking place in the \r\nworld, characterized by multipolarization, increasing \r\neconomic globalization, the frenetic pace of the \r\ncomputerization of society and broad cultural diversity.\r\nMuch progress has been made but, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has again pointed out, our world suffers \r\nfrom a lack of trust, the reconsideration of policies \r\nand a very strong sense of insecurity — feelings that \r\nare exacerbated by inequalities in development and \r\nthe surge in global challenges that have not yet been \r\nmastered, such as climate change and terrorism, not to \r\nmention the iniquitous severity of poverty and disease. \r\nWe are all witnessing humanitarian crises caused \r\nby conflicts affecting millions of people, including \r\nmigration crises, terrorist attacks and security threats \r\nin certain regions, to name but a few.\r\nThe theme chosen for this session places us at the \r\nheart of the major issues that drive the world today. It \r\nchallenges us with regard to the role of the Organization \r\nin the face of the disruptions that are undermining \r\nour societies today. The challenge of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the ambitious 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development require a strong and effective \r\nOrganization that engages all Member States.\r\nThe world is changing and evolving. That requires \r\nthe Organization to adapt to it in order to bring about \r\ngreater coherence in its approaches and responses. \r\nAchieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nis a sure way not only to establish development but also \r\nto fight inequality and guarantee human rights, with \r\na view to promoting social inclusion, a sine qua non \r\ncondition for lasting peace.\r\nSustainable development, to which we aspire, \r\nmust necessarily involve the preservation of the \r\nenvironment, which must be a priority if we are \r\nto more effectively eradicate extreme poverty and \r\nensure the sustainability and viability of our planet. \r\nIn that context, I welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\ninitiative to convene a summit on climate change next \r\nyear, and I hope that special attention will be paid to \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed \r\ncountries and small island States, so that they can adapt \r\ntheir economic development processes to evolving \r\nenvironmental hazards.\r\nIn this day and age, advocacy for women and girls \r\ncannot be ignored. We cannot turn a blind eye to the \r\ndeplorable conditions in which many women around the \r\nworld live, not to mention the many forms of gender-\r\nbased violence. Girls and women remain at the heart \r\nof the future of humankind. There is therefore a need \r\nto condemn with one voice the injustices of modern \r\nslavery, trafficking in persons and the worst forms of \r\nchild labour, which particularly affect women and girls. \r\nLet us give ourselves the means to improve the fate of \r\nhumankind by looking after our mothers, sisters and \r\ndaughters, to whom we must grant an equitable sharing \r\nof responsibilities.\r\nIt is also essential to act in the area of global health, \r\nwhich has an impact on the achievement of the SDGs, \r\nespecially in Africa. Madagascar can attest to that. The \r\nobstacles have been numerous and difficult — I would \r\njust mention the improvement of access to treatment \r\nand medicines and the specific commitment of all \r\ncommunities, especially in terms of prevention and \r\ninvestment. But it is necessary to persevere, and, with \r\nthe support of our partners, a universal health coverage \r\nsystem has been implemented. With the support of the \r\nentire United Nations family, Madagascar was declared \r\npolio-free this year.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda is a multisectoral programme for \r\ninclusive, equitable and sustainable development that \r\nseeks not to exclude any segment of the population. \r\nHowever, such a programme will remain a dead letter if \r\nit is not given the institutional and financial resources \r\nnecessary to achieve its objectives. In that regard, \r\nMadagascar fully supports the reforms undertaken \r\nby the Secretary-General and the Secretariat. Those \r\nreforms are certainly very ambitious, but we are \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n10/61 18-30073\r\ncounting on the active involvement of Member States \r\nfor their implementation.\r\nWith regard to resolution 72/279, entitled \r\n“Repositioning of the United Nations development \r\nsystem in the context of the quadrennial comprehensive \r\npolicy review of operational activities for development \r\nof the United Nations system”, Madagascar welcomes \r\nthe consensus that led to the adoption of that resolution \r\nin May. We also welcome the reforms undertaken at \r\nthe country team level and the role of the Resident \r\nCoordinators of the United Nations system. The \r\nresolution points the way forward so that, in full \r\nconsultation with, and by the mutual agreement of, \r\nGovernments the system can align more quickly with \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That \r\nwill ensure that better account is taken of the realities, \r\nneeds and priorities of Member States so that the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda programme truly \r\nbenefits the populations.\r\nIn that context, the accelerators of Madagascar’s \r\ndevelopment process for achieving the SDGs were \r\nidentified after implementing the mainstreaming, \r\nacceleration and policy support strategy at the end \r\nof April. The third general population and housing census \r\nof Madagascar was just completed, with the support of \r\nthe United Nations system and other partners, such as \r\nthe European Union. The results will provide important \r\ninsights into population dynamics and development, as \r\nwell as the implementation, monitoring and evaluation \r\nof the SDGs. They will be taken into account when we \r\nbegin to draft our next national development plan, for \r\nthe period 2020-2024.\r\nThe ultimate goal of the United Nations system is \r\nto maintain lasting peace for development in the world. \r\nConsiderable and commendable achievements attest to \r\nthe progress achieved, but we must admit that much \r\nremains to be done given the persistent challenges \r\nfacing the world and the unsatisfied aspirations. A world \r\nof peace and prosperity cannot be built by the isolated \r\naction of a single organization or a few individuals, \r\ncommunities or groups of States. It requires the \r\nimplementation of convergent and consensual actions \r\ndetermined by the aspirations of each party.\r\nAlthough most countries are recognized as \r\ndemocracies worldwide, the option of democratic \r\ngovernance is still one of the contemporary political \r\nconcepts that does not always enjoy unanimous \r\nsupport among nations. The Malagasy people, for their \r\npart, have always shown a particular interest in joint \r\nactions to safeguard democratic achievements. They \r\nhave always been of the conviction that progress in \r\ndemocracy ensures the stability that is essential for \r\ndevelopment and is a precondition for international \r\ncooperation. We are reminded of that when we look at \r\nthe historic step our country is taking in its ongoing \r\nquest for achieving mature democracy. Madagascar is \r\ntoday at a crossroads.\r\nUnder our Constitution, the presidential term is to \r\nbe shortened by a few months if the incumbent President \r\nruns for his own succession. In that purer spirit of a \r\nrepublic, the President of the Malagasy Republic, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hery Rajaonarimampianina \r\nRakotoarimanana, who was democratically elected in \r\n2013, submitted his resignation on 7 September, thereby \r\nupholding a constitutional requirement that is certainly \r\nunusual but was felt to be necessary by the Malagasy \r\npeople at a particular moment in their history.\r\nFor the first time, the constitutional provisions \r\nprescribing the transfer of presidential powers to the \r\nPresident of the Senate were implemented without any \r\nother process. The latter will therefore be responsible \r\nfor ensuring the continuity of the State and the regular \r\nfunctioning of public services until the arrival of a \r\nnew President of the Republic, whose inauguration is \r\nalready scheduled for 25 January 2019. That task will \r\ninclude ensuring that the ongoing electoral process is \r\nproperly conducted.\r\nIt is important to note in that respect that \r\nMadagascar is not in a phase of political transition in the \r\nsense usually understood when political divides lead to \r\na suspension of the Constitution. On the contrary, in the \r\npresent case we have simply submitted to the expression \r\nof the will of the sovereign people that is inscribed in \r\nthe Constitution. The situation is part of the continuity \r\nof our national political life and is certainly marked \r\nby a brief stage prescribed by fundamental sovereign \r\nlaw itself.\r\nThe former Secretary-General. the late Kofi Annan, \r\nsaid that no nation is born democratic. The situation in \r\nour country today shows a clear desire to consolidate \r\nprogress towards democracy. In parallel with that \r\nkey phase in our democracy, which is underpinned \r\nby a will for peace that seeks to maintain political \r\nstability at all costs, we have over the past four years \r\nbeen able to restore macroeconomic balance. We have \r\nseen positive changes in our basic indicators. We have \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 11/61\r\nrestored confidence and relations between national and \r\ninternational stakeholders, and we can therefore look \r\nforward to an economic growth rate that is expected \r\nto exceed 5 per cent this year, which will be the best \r\nperformance in 10 years.\r\nMr. Santos Maraver (Spain), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nIn the agricultural sector, which involves 80 per \r\ncent of the population, we have seen an increase in \r\nproduction and productivity, particularly in rice, thanks \r\nto public and private investment in hydro-agricultural \r\ninfrastructure and research in improved and adapted \r\nseeds, as well as new practices and techniques.\r\nWith respect to energy, Madagascar is going \r\nthrough a period of energy transition. We have seen \r\na significant increase in clean and renewable energy, \r\nespecially in the form of hydroelectric power plants and \r\nphotovoltaic power plants, to mention only what has \r\njust been handed over to the people of Ambatolampy \r\nand Ambohipihaonana in June. I am quite proud to say \r\nthat it is the largest power plant of its kind in the Indian \r\nOcean region and among the largest in sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica. Madagascar can reasonably expect a reduction \r\nin the cost of electricity by 2020 as a result of that type \r\nof project, despite the increase in the price of oil on the \r\ninternational market.\r\nExports have also performed well. The foreign \r\nexchange market has been under control, and inflation \r\nmay decrease to 7 per cent by the end of the year.\r\nIn the social sector, education and health have \r\nimproved significantly. Since 2014, we have built 24 \r\ncentres for accelerating the reduction of maternal and \r\nchild mortality and 315 basic health-care centres. The \r\nnational radiotherapy centre will soon be completed to \r\ntreat cancers. We have also set up 30 operating rooms \r\nin hard-to-reach areas.\r\nWith regard to education, we have been able to \r\nrecruit 44,000 new teachers since 2015, representing a \r\n30 per cent increase in the total number of teachers. \r\nWe have also built 1,087 classrooms and have fed \r\nmore than 354,100 students in school cafeterias. The \r\nsame improvement was recorded in the tourism sector, \r\nparticularly in airport infrastructure and reception \r\nbuildings. In the interest of good governance, we \r\nhave adopted several laws to fight corruption and \r\nthe illicit trafficking in our resources. The structural \r\nreform programme is well under way, including the \r\nimplementation of the anti-corruption programme.\r\nIn short, all those data points are indicators of \r\nstability and reveal growth that deserves support \r\nand consolidation. But despite all those efforts and \r\ndespite the potential of the country, Madagascar is \r\nstill undergoing hardship. We are aware of the need for \r\nstability, which is the guarantee of development. The \r\ncountry cannot be held hostage to a political crisis any \r\nlonger. The people understand that, given the fact that \r\nthe country has suffered so much.\r\nThe example had to come from the top. That is why \r\nPresident Rajaonarimampianina willingly complied \r\nwith the constitutional provisions by submitting his \r\nresignation. Madagascar is therefore seeking support \r\nfrom all of its development partners for the electoral \r\nprocess currently under way, the outcome of which is \r\na source of hope for the Malagasy people. I also take \r\nthis opportunity to reiterate the call to all to foster \r\neffective synergy within the Organization to promote \r\nthe building of a better future, for which all nations \r\nhave a right to hope.\r\nBefore concluding, I join my predecessors in \r\npaying tribute to a worthy son of our continent, our \r\nformer Secretary-General the late Kofi Atta Annan. On \r\nthe strength of his convictions, that fervent defender \r\nof multilateralism worked to rethink and build a \r\nstronger Organization that is better able to alleviate the \r\nills of many people around the world in the name of \r\nhumankind. He will undoubtedly remain a source of \r\ninspiration for all.\r\nFinally, I would like to conclude by recalling that this \r\nyear marks the seventieth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the instrument that has best served humankind: \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. May it \r\ncontinue to inspire and guide us in the struggles that \r\nstill lie ahead of us for a new world order where no one \r\nwill ever again be left behind. May God keep us.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident ad interim of the Republic of Madagascar for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Rivo Rakotovao, President ad interim of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n12/61 18-30073\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Indonesia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Indonesia.\r\nMr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Kalla (Indonesia): I join others in \r\ncongratulating Her Excellency Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés on her election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session. She \r\nmay rest assured that Indonesia will give her its full \r\nsupport for the success of her presidency. I also wish \r\nto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák \r\non his success in guiding the Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session.\r\nLet me also express our deepest sympathy and \r\ncondolences on the passing of former Secretary-General \r\nKofi Annan. The world has lost a great peacemaker and \r\ntrue humanist. We will always remember his legacy.\r\nThe world continues to face complex global \r\nchallenges, where instabilities and conflicts are still \r\nrampant. Extreme poverty and inequalities linger. \r\nZero-sum thinking and narrow nationalism often \r\nprevail. Furthermore, violations of human rights and \r\ndemocratic values remain day-to-day problems in \r\nour lives. at times like these, we often look in vain \r\nto leadership to show great strength, indeed to wield \r\nsuperhero-like powers.\r\nHowever, the world does not need to look for \r\nsuperheroes; we do not need to call on the strength \r\nof the Avengers or that of the Justice League. We in \r\nthis Hall are global leaders. Collectively, we have \r\nthe strength of superheroes. What we must do now is \r\nharness our own individual wills, courage, strength, \r\ncompassion, self lessness and humility. This is the very \r\nessence of the United Nations, where we all believe in \r\nthe strength and power of the mantra contained in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, “We the peoples of the \r\nUnited Nations”.\r\nAs global leaders — young and old, women and \r\nmen — we must work together to encourage others \r\nto achieve the goals and objectives of the United \r\nNations. The theme of this year’s general debate \r\ncaptures precisely what needs to be done by all of \r\nus as a community of nations and a community of \r\nleaders. The message is loud and clear. Pursuing peace, \r\nequality and sustainability for our peoples requires \r\nglobal leadership and shared responsibility. There is no \r\neffective leadership without genuine responsibility and \r\nvice versa.\r\nThe first point I wish to make today is that \r\nglobal leadership and responsibility will determine \r\nthe outcome of our quest for lasting peace. Peace is \r\nnot merely the absence of war. It is also a question of \r\nthe commitment to peace. Our continuous efforts to \r\nmaintain stability and prevent conflict must underpin \r\nour pursuit of happiness. But this must start with genuine \r\nleadership. It is at home, in our surroundings and in our \r\nrespective regions, that we must start working to create \r\necosystems of peace, stability and prosperity. Indonesia \r\nwill always believe in that way of thinking.\r\nWe cannot do so alone, which is why, as an elected \r\nnon-permanent member of Security Council next \r\nyear, Indonesia will need the membership’s continued \r\nsupport. We are grateful for the General Assembly’s \r\ntrust and confidence, and we will do our best to become \r\nits true partner for peace.\r\nFor the past five decades, we have enjoyed a \r\nlong peace dividend in the Asia-Pacific region. Since \r\ngeopolitical and geostrategic landscapes are changing \r\nso fast, Indonesia sees the opportunity to extend the \r\npeace dividend to the larger Indo-Pacific region. Along \r\nwith other countries of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations, we are promoting an outlook that sees \r\nthe Indian and Pacific regions as a single geostrategic \r\ntheatre and a region of cooperation, not competition, \r\nwith a view to supporting a greater global ecosystem \r\nof peace.\r\nThe commitment to and responsibility for peace \r\nmust be replicated across all regions, including in \r\nthe Middle East. Central to peace and stability in the \r\nMiddle East is the long-standing question of Palestine. \r\nIf we cannot resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, \r\nour commitment to peace will be called into question. \r\nSetbacks persist as we speak in the form of the imminent \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 13/61\r\nthreat to the status quo of Jerusalem, the precarious \r\nlives of millions of Palestinian refugees that are at stake \r\nand the humanitarian situation, which is getting worse \r\nevery day. Not only does the current situation harm the \r\npeace process, it destroys the hopes of the Palestinian \r\npeople — the hopes of all of us — for an independent \r\nPalestinian State. The international community can no \r\nlonger remain at a standstill on these issues. We must \r\ncall for immediate negotiations that can make the two-\r\nState solution a reality. Indonesia will continue to stand \r\nwith the people of Palestine until the day Palestine is \r\ntruly independent.\r\nAt the global level, Indonesia is honoured to have \r\ncontributed to United Nations peacekeeping. To date, \r\nIndonesia has contributed more than 3,500 personnel in \r\nnine United Nations missions and is the eighth-largest \r\ntroop- and police-contributing country. We will not stop \r\nthere. We are ready to contribute 4,000 peacekeepers \r\nby 2019, with an increasing proportion of female \r\npeacekeepers. Beyond numbers, we believe that United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations should continue to be \r\nthe Organization’s f lagship enterprise. But that can be \r\nachieved only if we strengthen its capacity to deliver on \r\nits mandate. That is why we have endorsed the Action \r\nfor Peacekeeping declaration.\r\nI will begin my second point with a question: after \r\npeace has been achieved, will that peace be enough? \r\nPeace should not be seen as an end in and of itself. It \r\nmust create an environment conducive to development. \r\nPeace and development must go hand in hand, as \r\nthey are mutually reinforcing. Only then can peace \r\nbring benefits to our peoples. It is for that reason that \r\ndevelopment goals and commitments have been agreed \r\nupon. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the Paris Agreement on Climate Change are but \r\ntwo obvious examples.\r\nAnother milestone was also reached in December, \r\nnamely, the first-ever global instrument on migration, \r\nwhich was adopted in Marrakech. These agreements \r\nrepresent global leadership and a shared responsibility \r\nfor a better future where no one is left behind. That \r\napplies to all countries, be they large or small, from the \r\nNorth or the South, developed or developing. In short, \r\nthose agreements show our collective compassion and \r\nself lessness, which are the badges of global leadership \r\nat its finest. The next question is how we are going to \r\nlive up to those commitments. The answer is that global \r\nleadership needs to create environments conducive to \r\nthe fulfilment of these commitments, which is very \r\nsimple on paper but not so straightforward in practice.\r\nThree years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, \r\nmany success stories have been told. However, results \r\nand progress may vary in various parts of the world. \r\nLingering conflicts, instability, protectionism and \r\nan uncertain global economic outlook continue to \r\nhamper our common efforts to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). Regrettably, time is not on \r\nour side. Some of us are running behind schedule in \r\nour efforts to hit the SDG targets. To overcome that \r\nfact, the pace of implementation must be accelerated. \r\nDecisive actions must be taken to improve access to \r\nfinancing, capacity-building and technology. Global \r\nleadership and partnership must be pursued in future to \r\nachieve win-win solutions.\r\nAs part of our global leadership and responsibility, \r\nIndonesia has taken concrete steps to implement its \r\ncommitments. Through South-South and triangular \r\ncooperation, Indonesia has offered more than 500 \r\ncapacity-building programmes to more than 6,000 \r\nparticipants across the globe, from Asia to Africa, \r\nfrom the South Pacific to the Caribbean. We will soon \r\nlaunch the Indonesia Aid for Development programme \r\nto reinforce the delivery of our international assistance. \r\nMoreover, earlier this year, Indonesia hosted the first-\r\never Indonesia-Africa Forum, which is a testament to \r\nour strong commitment to promote win-win cooperation \r\nwith the African continent. Furthermore, as a follow-\r\nup, we will convene an Indonesia-Africa Infrastructure \r\nDialogue next year, which will focus on infrastructure, \r\nin order to accelerate development in Africa.\r\nAs the largest archipelagic country in the world, we \r\nare fully aware of the adverse impact of climate change, \r\nas the countries that have to face this issue most acutely \r\nhave been the small island developing States. We are \r\nconvening an archipelagic and island States conference \r\nat the margins of the Our Ocean Conference next month \r\nas proof of our firm leadership and commitment to \r\naddressing this matter.\r\nPeace and development can be sustained only if we \r\nhave an equitable society, which leads me to my third \r\npoint today: the importance of creating a society that \r\nis just, inclusive, democratic and respectful of human \r\nrights. An equitable, tolerant, and moderate society is key \r\nto addressing the major challenges of violent extremism \r\nand radicalism. Injustice, exclusiveness, extreme \r\npoverty, illiteracy and massive youth unemployment \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n14/61 18-30073\r\nmust be eliminated. Hard- and soft-power approaches \r\nmust be improved. For that reason, we have amended \r\nour national law and strengthened our soft approach in \r\norder to adapt to new evolving challenges. The recent \r\nhorrific terrorist attack in Surabaya, Indonesia, showed \r\nthat the use  of violence by terrorists knows no bounds. \r\nUsing children as weapons can never be right. But that \r\nattack will only strengthen our determination to work \r\nmore closely with the international community.\r\nIn order to create peaceful, sustainable and equitable \r\nsocieties, all countries must respect international law \r\nand the principles of the United Nations, including \r\nthe respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nof other countries. In that regard, Indonesia strongly \r\ndeplores the attempts of one country to support or, even \r\nworse, become part of separatist movements. Such acts \r\nof hostility have no place in the United Nations system, \r\nespecially since they are acts in clear violation of United \r\nNations principles. Indonesia has long chosen to build \r\nfriendly relations with that particular country, including \r\nin showing our solidarity and sympathy during difficult \r\ntimes. But when such hostile acts continue, Indonesia \r\nwill not remain silent. Indonesia will not let any \r\ncountry undermine its territorial integrity. Like any \r\nother sovereign country, Indonesia will firmly defend \r\nits territorial integrity. I repeat: Indonesia will firmly \r\ndefend its territorial integrity.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that peaceful, \r\nequitable and sustainable societies require a more \r\nresponsive, responsible and credible United Nations. \r\nWe at the United Nations must show leadership, \r\nwhich is why United Nations reform is unavoidable. \r\nOtherwise, the United Nations will become obsolete \r\nand unable to respond to the needs and challenges of \r\ntoday and tomorrow.\r\nThe goal of the United Nations reform is \r\ncrystal-clear. The Organization needs to be better \r\npositioned to help countries sustain peace and achieve \r\nthe SDGs. Each one of us has a role to play in keeping \r\nthe United Nations relevant and in ensuring that the \r\nUnited Nations delivers. Indonesia stands ready to \r\ncontribute to that noble goal for the sake of humankind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Indonesia for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Indonesia, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Daniel Kablan Duncan, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nMr. Daniel Kablan Duncan, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Daniel \r\nKablan Duncan, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Duncan (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French): \r\nI would like to congratulate Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés on her auspicious election to preside \r\nover the General Assembly at its seventy-third session \r\nand wish her, on behalf of the President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, His Excellency Mr. Alassane Ouattara, \r\nevery success in the implementation of the priorities \r\nof her mandate. Our congratulations also go to her \r\npredecessor, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, for the quality of the \r\nwork accomplished during his term of office. Allow me \r\nalso to pay special tribute to our Secretary-General, \r\nMr. António Guterres, for his tireless efforts and strong \r\ndetermination to consolidate the important role of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nOur session opens in an international context \r\nmarked by many challenges and uncertainties that are \r\ngradually eroding our ability to respond collectively \r\nand adequately to threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity. In addition, there are challenges relating to \r\nhumanitarian and health crises, extreme poverty, and \r\nviolations of human rights and democratic values. The \r\nOrganization we share and the world today seem to be \r\nlosing their vocation to protect the most vulnerable, to \r\npromote a more just and inclusive global governance, \r\nand to build a true community of destiny among nations.\r\nThis observation justifies and makes essential the \r\nexistence of the United Nations and reminds us that \r\nchanges in the international scene and the successive \r\nshifts in international actors should not be to the \r\ndetriment of the Organization. There is therefore an \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 15/61\r\nurgent need to speed up the modernization of our \r\nOrganization and to consolidate the foundations of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Based on that important \r\naction, we welcome the aptly chosen theme of the \r\ngeneral debate for this session of the General Assembly, \r\nnamely, “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople:  global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”.\r\nLittle progress is being made, unfortunately, in the \r\nstruggle against world hunger and extreme poverty, \r\nthe increasing number of crises and human tragedies, \r\nand the f low of displaced persons and refugees, all of \r\nwhich continue to be significant sources of concern for \r\nthe international community. The theme of this session \r\nis therefore relevant and constitutes a call to reinvent \r\nthe action of the United Nations and the modes of \r\ncollaboration among its Member States.\r\nThe challenges and uncertainties facing our world \r\ntoday must lead Member States to embrace a shared \r\nvision of the central role and value of the United Nations \r\nin shaping our collective responses. Member States \r\nmust therefore be resolute in taking back the ownership \r\nof our universal Organization so that it remains an \r\norganization for all peoples, in accordance with the \r\nideals of the founding fathers. In order to accomplish \r\nthat, one of the priorities is to restore full moral \r\nauthority to the United Nations, so that it can act and \r\nenforce its resolutions with the support of its Member \r\nStates in all the wide-ranging fields of collective action \r\nat the service of all peoples.\r\nThe United Nations is at a crossroads and must \r\nmeet various expectations that will shape its future and \r\neffectiveness. In that regard, Côte d’Ivoire believes, \r\nas President Alassane Ouattara has often said, that \r\nnow is the time to reform the Security Council so that \r\nit can be more effective and more representative of \r\ntoday’s world. Only a truly united Council can enable \r\nour Organization to effectively address major security \r\nissues such as the fight against nuclear proliferation, \r\nterrorism, mass crimes and crimes against humanity. \r\nAt the same time, we must agree that the fight against \r\nglobal warming will be successful only if we fully \r\naccept that global warming is a threat to world peace \r\nand international security.\r\nThe solidarity that we ardently call for in the \r\nsettlement of conflicts must not be selective or be \r\nlimited to mere declarations of intent. We must in all \r\ncircumstances reach a minimum moral and political \r\nconsensus, allowing our Organization not to remain \r\nunmoved by the sight of the faces ravaged by the \r\ndevastating effects of conflicts, wars and endemic \r\ndiseases that we see daily on our television screens. \r\nSuch a  consensus must also enable the Organization to \r\nplay an important role in promoting conflict prevention \r\nand strengthening democratic institutions as the only \r\nmeans of combating rivalries between neighbours, \r\nas well as political, ethnic and religious tensions and \r\nborder conflicts.\r\nThe responsibility of the United Nations for a new \r\ncommitment to action should continue to expand based \r\non the principle of the responsibility to protect, which \r\nbecame a standard of public international law when it \r\nwas adopted by all Member States at the 2005 World \r\nSummit. I would like to take this opportunity to pay \r\na well-deserved tribute to our late former Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, who died on 18 August, for \r\nhis commitment to the success of that Summit. My \r\ndelegation celebrates the memory of that worthy son of \r\nAfrica, who was one of the most remarkable figures \r\nin the history of the United Nations. His vast and \r\nrich experience of international issues contributed, \r\nthrough his numerous initiatives and actions, to the \r\nstrengthening of international peace and security.\r\nWe must keep in mind that no collective security \r\nsystem can be viable unless we seek to eradicate the \r\nmain causes of the sociopolitical unrest apparent in \r\nmany States, in particular extreme poverty. While there \r\nis no doubt that the United Nations is focusing more \r\nand more on economic issues, it is imperative that we \r\nstep up action on the social level, which is essential. \r\nHumankind should be more at the heart of our concerns, \r\nas has been reflected in the focus of the major questions \r\nthat have been the subject of the conferences organized \r\non major issues, such as the protection of children, the \r\nprotection of women, population and development, and \r\nhuman rights. Unfortunately, however, those meetings \r\nyielded few concrete results.\r\nThat is why Côte d’Ivoire invites the international \r\ncommunity to implement the relevant resolutions \r\nadopted during this cycle of thematic conferences \r\nthat recognize the need to reject widespread poverty \r\nand combat illiteracy and endemic diseases, famine, \r\nmalnutrition and other disparities. Otherwise, it is \r\nfeared that some States facing large disparities will \r\nbecome breeding grounds or sanctuaries for terrorist \r\ngroups, money-laundering centres or hubs for the illegal \r\ninternational transit and trafficking of drugs.\r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n16/61 18-30073\r\nThe human dimension embraced by the Ivorian \r\nGovernment in drawing up its development policy \r\nhas consisted of taking measures to ensure a better \r\ndistribution of the benefits of strong economic growth \r\nand a more effective struggle against poverty. The \r\nsignificant investments devoted to infrastructure and \r\nthe social sectors have made it possible to improve \r\naccess to education, water, electricity and health care, \r\nleading to a significant reduction in the rate of poverty. \r\nIn order to enhance and accelerate that momentum, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire has given itself the means through its second \r\nnational development plan for 2016-2020, to mobilize \r\nthe necessary resources to the tune of $60 billion. We \r\nhave also adopted important security measures in the \r\nfight against the global threats that face all countries \r\nin the region.\r\nThe challenges posed by unregulated migratory \r\nf lows concern all of us, and we call for the concerted \r\nmanagement of that significant issue, which affects \r\nmainly young people from Africa. The stance taken by \r\nCôte d’Ivoire on that matter, which is shared by most \r\ncountries in our region, has always been that the problem \r\nmust be tackled principally from the development point \r\nof view. Only the work and development opportunities \r\nthat are offered to our young people so that they can \r\nforge a future on their native soil can resolve the issue \r\nin a sustainable way.\r\nThat stance is bolstered by the fact that 26 per cent \r\nof those living in Côte d’Ivoire are foreign nationals, \r\nas Côte d’Ivoire receives a significant share of \r\nregional migration f lows. There is no denying that \r\nthe management of the migration crisis requires a \r\ncommitment from the countries of origin, transit \r\nand arrival. That is the only way in which we will \r\nbe able to effectively fight against human trafficking \r\nand find appropriate solutions to irregular migration, \r\nas advocated by the African Union-European Union \r\nSummit held in 2017 in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nIt is through the accelerated implementation of \r\nthe major reforms set out in Agenda 2063 that Africa \r\ncan become the new frontier for development. Finally, \r\nin seeking solutions to the challenges we face, our \r\ncollective intelligence dictates that we cooperate in \r\nthe framework of a more cohesive, democratic and \r\nefficient Organization.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Daniel Kablan Duncan, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Ms. Epsy Campbell Barr, First \r\nVice-President and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Costa Rica\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the First \r\nVice-President and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica.\r\nMs. Epsy Campbell Barr, First Vice-President \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nCosta Rica, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Ms. Epsy \r\nCampbell Barr, First Vice-President and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Costa Rica, and \r\ninviting her to address the Assembly.\r\nMs. Campbell Barr (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I am very grateful to be able to address the \r\nAssembly as a female Chancellor and Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Costa Rica. I extend to the Assembly \r\nand the representatives of all countries a warm greeting \r\nfrom President Carlos Alvarado Quesada. My country \r\nis fully convinced that together we can build a different \r\nfuture with courage, determination, imagining the \r\nimpossible and striving to achieve it. The fact that \r\nthe Assembly is today presided over by a woman, the \r\nfourth to lead this forum in its 73 years of existence, is \r\npart of a new moment in history when equality between \r\nmen and women is built on concrete acts. That is why \r\nmy country welcomes her election and congratulates \r\nher. President Carlos Alvarado Quesada formed a \r\ngender-balanced cabinet in Costa Rica for the first time \r\nin its history, and the country today benefits from the \r\ntalent, ability, knowledge and leadership of women in \r\npositions of power.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for the impetus \r\nhe has generated aimed at achieving gender parity \r\nwithin the United Nations system, and we reaffirm \r\nour commitment to continue to support the specific \r\nmeasures proposed for that purpose. The economic \r\nempowerment of women is also of vital importance for \r\nwomen if they are to exercise their autonomy, while \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 17/61\r\ntheir incorporation into the labour market significantly \r\nand evidentially contributes to the economy and to \r\nfamilies, communities and society in general. Costa \r\nRica is convinced that it is necessary to continue to \r\nmake progress in that area and is therefore co-chairing, \r\ntogether with the United Kingdom, the Group of \r\nChampions for Women’s Economic Empowerment.\r\nOur country renounced its army 70 years ago, and \r\nsince then our defence doctrines have been based on \r\ndialogue, negotiation between States and international \r\nlaw. That achievement is cherished by the Costa Rican \r\npeople and one that we wish to share as we approach \r\nthe bicentenary of our independence. The decisions that \r\nour leaders face do not involve renovating our military \r\narsenals or engaging in strategic military alliances. \r\nCosta Rica is convinced of the need to ensure sustainable \r\ndevelopment in all three of its dimensions: social, \r\neconomic and environmental; to promote inclusion and \r\nthe universalization of access to opportunities; and to \r\ninvest in education, health and housing, with particular \r\nattention to populations in vulnerable situations.\r\nCosta Rica believes in democracy, with a robust \r\nelectoral system that guarantees that nobody can \r\nperpetually remain in power. Costa Rica is also \r\nconvinced of the need to protect human rights with \r\na modern legal system supported by advanced \r\ninternational conventions and inspired by the needs of \r\nthose who have suffered discrimination and prejudice. \r\nFurthermore. Costa Rica is convinced of the need for \r\nindividual freedom, protecting the right to expression, \r\ncommunication and information. Costa Rica expresses \r\nthose commitments as a member of the community \r\nof nations, trusting in the protections afforded by \r\ninternational law and the standards of coexistence and \r\navoiding any provocation from other countries.\r\nFor that reason, the United Nations, as the \r\nmultilateral organization par excellence, occupies a \r\nspecial place in the hearts of Costa Ricans. There are \r\nthose who protest against what they call interference \r\nby United Nations bodies, and others who refuse to pay \r\ntheir assessments and financial contributions. There \r\nare those who question United Nations institutions, and \r\nothers who ignore its agreements. Costa Rica, for its part, \r\nreiterates the  need for the United Nations as a strong, \r\nefficient, austere, robust and transparent organization \r\nthat is committed to sustainable development, dialogue, \r\npeace, human rights and protecting the norms of \r\ninternational law. It is not only for Costa Rica, but \r\nfor many countries and communities as well, that the \r\nUnited Nations represents the last glimmer of hope, and \r\nwe cannot fail them.\r\nCosta Rica condemns terrorism and violent \r\nextremism, which is conducive to terrorism. Women \r\nand girls suffer the greatest consequences, and in some \r\ncases those consequences are indelible. Peacebuilding \r\nmust be a sustained effort. We firmly believe in fostering \r\na culture of peace through the promotion of justice, \r\ndemocratic participation, human rights and education, \r\nand we reject all types of violence and recognize the \r\nimportant task of preventing the causes of conflicts.\r\nSince 2017, Costa Rica has proudly and with a \r\ngreat sense of responsibility formed part of the group \r\nof countries that contribute on the ground under the \r\nbanner of the United Nations. My country welcomes \r\nthe participation of Costa Rican women police officers \r\nas international observers in the United Nations \r\nVerification Mission in Colombia. We recognize the \r\nefforts of the Mission to incorporate an approach based \r\non gender equality. We call for an end to impunity for \r\nthe most serious crimes. In that connection, we reaffirm \r\nour support for the mandate of the International \r\nCriminal Court, and we call on those who have made \r\nthe decision to withdraw from the Court to return to \r\nthe cause of international criminal law. We strongly \r\nsupport that Court as a legitimate tool for international \r\njustice that should be strengthened, because the victims \r\ndeserve justice, especially in cases where their national \r\nsystems are not able to provide it.\r\nIt is also important to reiterate that sexual violence \r\nis always unacceptable. However, what is particularly \r\nconcerning is its widespread use as a tactic of terror and \r\nweapon of war and terrorism, where it is used as one of \r\nthe most cruel and terrible forms of social coercion; a \r\nstrategy to control and intimidate entire communities, \r\ndeeply affecting people’s dignity and autonomy. Cases \r\nof sexual exploitation and abuse have irreparable \r\nconsequences for the persons affected. We support \r\nthe zero-tolerance policy on abuse in that regard. We \r\nreiterate our condemnation of such abuse committed \r\nby the staff of this Organization, which damages its \r\ncredibility, impedes the appropriate implementation \r\nof mandates and creates excuses for those who want to \r\ndestroy multilateralism.\r\nWe welcome the Panmunjom Declaration and the \r\nPyongyang Declaration, and we are hopeful that they \r\nwill lead to effective implementation and the complete \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula. We also \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n18/61 18-30073\r\nexpress our support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan \r\nof Action, endorsed by the Security Council. We also \r\ncelebrate the historic peace agreement between Eritrea \r\nand Ethiopia. We once again join the international \r\ncommunity in calling for the lifting of the blockade \r\nagainst Cuba, which has been in effect for far too many \r\nyears, affecting the ability of its population to generate \r\ndevelopment and prosperity.\r\nCosta Rica dreamed of being a country without an \r\narmy, and for 70 years now that has been a reality. We \r\nwere also at the forefront of the adoption of the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty, and today we promote its implementation. \r\nNow, together with a group of States and civil society \r\norganizations, we are trying to devise a world without \r\nnuclear weapons. In our view, the only way to ensure \r\nthat nuclear weapons are never used again under any \r\ncircumstances is through their total elimination. With \r\nthe adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, the international community decided that \r\nthe legally binding prohibition of those weapons is a \r\nfundamental contribution to the accomplishment of \r\nthat objective. With deep conviction and a sense of \r\nethics, we call today on all countries to sign and ratify \r\nthat historic Treaty.\r\nCosta Rica cannot and will not be indifferent to the \r\nsuffering of and uncertainty facing those we consider \r\nour brothers and sisters. Since April, we have expressed \r\nour concern at the deterioration of institutions and the \r\nsystematic erosion of human rights in Nicaragua, as \r\nhas been confirmed by the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. Selective \r\nrepression, intimidation and criminalization have \r\nundermined the freedoms of its population one by one. \r\nWe must mention that the grave situation in Nicaragua \r\nhas claimed several hundred human lives. As a result, \r\nour country has experienced an increase in migratory \r\nf lows and refugee applications. We have responded \r\nin an orderly, responsible and supportive manner, \r\nprioritizing the protection, respect, dignity and security \r\nof the people. However, it is clear that Costa Rica alone \r\ncannot carry that burden.\r\nThe situation in Nicaragua is not sustainable. \r\nDialogue remains suspended, seemingly indefinitely, \r\nand the Government has expelled the delegation of \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights. The crisis in that country has \r\nthe potential to escalate, with a direct impact on the \r\nstability and development of all of Central America. \r\nCosta Rica reiterates its conviction that only committed \r\nand effective dialogue between all parties, leading to a \r\ngenuine agreement on a timetable for democratization, \r\ncan be the solution to the conflict that is aff licting \r\nour brother country. Today, we ask the international \r\ncommunity and the Secretary-General to participate in \r\npreventive diplomacy and mediation in the face of that \r\nserious situation. When it comes to the lives and dignity \r\nof people and the lack of possibility for them to live free \r\nfrom fear and misery, silence makes us accomplices. \r\nThat is why Costa Rica is speaking out.\r\nWe reiterate our concern at the situation in \r\nVenezuela and the lack of respect for the rule of law \r\nand Venezuelan institutions in that country, as well as \r\nthe violations of human rights there. Costa Rica has \r\nconsistently supported the international community in \r\nits efforts in that regard, including those made this week \r\nin the Human Rights Council in Geneva. We reaffirm \r\nour commitment to contributing to overcoming the \r\nserious political, economic, social and humanitarian \r\ncrisis in Venezuela, through a peaceful and negotiated \r\nsolution, within the framework of international law.\r\nThis year will be of particular importance in \r\nbuilding a consensus that will allow us to reach a \r\nglobal framework of cooperation, so that we can \r\nat least achieve safe, orderly and regular migration \r\nwith the adoption of a global compact on migration \r\nand another on refugees. Costa Rica welcomes that \r\npossibility with enthusiasm. Only with constant \r\ncoordination and cooperation, including with those \r\ncountries that responsibly receive f lows of migrants \r\nand refugees — especially if they are developing \r\ncountries — will we be able to manage human mobility \r\nin a way that enhances its positive effects. It is essential \r\nto deepen our approach to human mobility, a global and \r\ncomplex phenomenon of great relevance, which should \r\nalso become one of the key points on the international \r\nagenda. We need a common, comprehensive and long-\r\nterm vision of migration and refuge-seeking, based \r\non sovereignty, joint responsibility in its governance \r\nand, above all, solidarity. Let us create a world where \r\ndiversity, identity and culture are understood as a \r\nsource of wealth and growth.\r\nCosta Rica draws attention to the International \r\nDecade for People of African Descent, which began \r\nin January 2015. In 2020, we will have a review at \r\nthe mid-point of the Decade, but we know already \r\nthat we have not made sufficient progress. We require \r\nthe necessary resources, as mandated by the General \r\nAssembly, in order to take concrete measures to \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 19/61\r\nrecognize the contributions of that population and \r\nto respect, protect and realize their fundamental \r\nrights. Costa Rica also welcomes the adoption of the \r\nDecade of Family Farming, which aims to improve \r\nthe working and living conditions of family farmers \r\nso they can contribute to the achievement of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. Family farming is \r\nlinked to the sustainable production and consumption \r\nof food and to the cultural events of our population. \r\nWe invite all countries to take action, both nationally \r\nand internationally, in order to realize the aspirations \r\nof the Decade.\r\nIt is imperative to ensure compliance with the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The \r\nAdministration of President Carlos Alvarado Quesada \r\nmaintains its commitment to the national pact for the \r\nfulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nwhich was signed in 2016 by the public sector, \r\nthe business sector, workers’ organizations, civil \r\nsociety organizations, faith-based organizations, \r\nsocial organizations and local governments. Costa \r\nRica recognizes the comprehensive, universal, \r\ntransformative and multidimensional nature of the \r\nSDGs. We consider it essential that, in order to fulfil \r\nthe 2030 Agenda, we fully acknowledge the concept \r\nof the multidimensionality of poverty, as required by \r\na thorough response from the international community \r\nand the United Nations system, so that middle-income \r\ncountries can continue to access finance and ensure the \r\nclosing of the structural gaps that persist and hamper \r\nour efforts to achieve sustainable development.\r\nWe are currently working on a decarbonization \r\nplan that is innovative, decisive and committed, with \r\na long-term vision and a set of immediate actions that \r\nrequire transformational efforts in our society. The plan \r\nidentifies a series of technological transformations, \r\nsuch as efficient and renewable public transport, a \r\nf leet of zero-emission light vehicles, integrated waste \r\nmanagement and low-emission waste disposal, highly \r\nefficient agri-food systems that generate low-carbon \r\nfoodstuffs, a model of livestock development that is \r\nresilient and eco-competitive based on productive \r\nefficiency and an increase in forest cover and ecosystem \r\nservices rooted in nature-based solutions. The \r\ndecarbonization of our society is the greatest task of our \r\ngeneration. Costa Rica aspires to become a laboratory \r\nin the process of the extensive decarbonization of the \r\nworld economy. Just as we once abolished our army, \r\nwe are now going to abolish our dependence on fossil \r\nfuels. We are determined to do everything necessary \r\nand, with the collaboration of us all, it will happen.\r\nIn that regard, Costa Rica invites all Member \r\nStates to participate in a new initiative, namely, the \r\ncoalition for all. This coalition seeks to promote \r\nthe integration of the language of human rights and \r\ngender into multilateral environmental agreements \r\nand environmental financial mechanisms in an \r\narticulated and consistent manner. This week, we \r\nalso signed the Escazú Agreement, also known as \r\nthe Regional Agreement on Access to Information, \r\nPublic Participation and Justice in Environmental \r\nMatters in Latin America and the Caribbean. That \r\ninnovative international instrument, for which Costa \r\nRica co-chaired the negotiation process, represents the \r\ncontribution of our region to environmental democracy \r\nand the construction of a more sustainable and more \r\ninclusive world.\r\nGreat transformations need not wait. We can be \r\npart of a new generation of light made up of innovative \r\nand committed people with an inspiring vision of our \r\npotential as a society and determined to promote a \r\npositive global transformation. It is time to forge a more \r\nsustainable, fairer, freer and more inclusive future. \r\nCosta Rica believes that all nations around the world \r\nshare those aspirations. In any case, the Assembly \r\ncan count on the full assistance of Costa Rica to \r\nwork in that direction with anyone willing to believe \r\nthat we are all obliged to deliver a better planet to the \r\ncoming generations.\r\nIt is true that we have witnessed global and national \r\nevents that seem to highlight setbacks in terms of peace \r\nand human rights and even actions that seem contrary \r\nto sustainable development, but that fact must not \r\ndiscourage us. One era dies, and another is born. It dies \r\nat this moment in history. It is time to celebrate the fact \r\nthat young leaders from all over the world are moving \r\nto promote rights and build better societies. Today, we \r\nhave a committed, passionate and compassionate youth \r\nthat often renounces its own comfort to promote and \r\nprotect the rights of others. I have called that generation \r\nthe “generation of light”, because it rescues the best of \r\nthe past and the best of the achievements of humankind, \r\nand the commitment to the environment, society, peace \r\nand well-being. It is a generation that looks to the future \r\nwithout fear and is rallying for a new world without \r\nweapons or violence, for the environment, for peace, \r\nfor human rights, for sexual diversity, against any type \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n20/61 18-30073\r\nof discrimination and in favour of a better world. The \r\ngeneration of light will undoubtedly change the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nFirst Vice-President and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Costa Rica for the statement she has \r\njust made.\r\nMs. Epsy Campbell Barr, First Vice-President \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nCosta Rica, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. K. P. Sharma Oli, Prime Minister \r\nof the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.\r\nMr. K. P. Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Nepal, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. K. P. \r\nSharma Oli, Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic \r\nRepublic of Nepal, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Oli (Nepal): First of all, I extend warm \r\nfelicitations to the President on her election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its current \r\nsession. The outgoing President deserves our \r\nappreciation for successfully steering the Assembly’s \r\nwork during the previous session. We also commend \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, for the \r\ndedication, commitment and leadership with which he \r\nhas been serving the Organization. As we commemorate \r\nthe 100th birth anniversary of Nelson Mandela, I would \r\nlike to express my profound respect for that great leader \r\nand the cause he fought for. An iconic figure, he was a \r\ngreat human soul and remains a source of inspiration for \r\npeace, justice, harmony, forgiveness and reconciliation. \r\nThis year, we have also lost an outstanding diplomat \r\nand visionary in the former Secretary-General, the \r\nlate Kofi Annan. I also pay sincere tribute to the \r\ntremendous contributions he made to the promotion of \r\npeace, development and human rights in the world.\r\nI bring greetings and best wishes from the land of \r\nBuddha and Sagarmatha, also known as Mount Everest, \r\nfor the success of this session of the Assembly. Since I \r\naddressed the Assembly from this rostrum in 2006 (see \r\nA/61/PV.18), Nepal has undergone a historic political \r\ntransformation. Through dialogue and deliberations, \r\nmutual respect and accommodation, we have steered \r\na uniquely successful home-grown, nationally led \r\nand nationally owned peace process. It was about the \r\npeaceful transformation of an armed conflict. It was \r\nabout the restructuring of the State and promoting unity \r\nin diversity. It was about making the Nepali people \r\ntruly sovereign and a source of State power, and it was \r\nabout institutionalizing and consolidating all those \r\nachievements in a democratic constitution through a \r\npopularly elected constituent assembly.\r\nDespite the difficulties in the wake of devastating \r\nearthquakes, the political leaders rose to the occasion \r\nwith a common resolve to promulgate the new \r\nConstitution in September 2015, therefore fulfilling the \r\nseven-decade-long aspirations of the people to write \r\ntheir own constitution. The Constitution of Nepal not \r\nonly consolidates democratic polity under a federal \r\nrepublican order, but also embodies the extensive rights \r\nand freedoms of the people. The separation of powers, \r\nthe system of checks and balances, the rule of law, \r\nthe independence of the judiciary, periodic elections, \r\nand inclusive and proportional representation are the \r\ndefining features of the new Constitution.\r\nOur vision is one of a comprehensive democracy \r\nthat empowers individuals not only politically but also \r\nsocially, economically and culturally. Implementing \r\nthe Constitution was another paramount task before us. \r\nWe accomplished that historic task last year through \r\nthe free, fair and impartial elections at the federal, \r\nprovincial and local levels with a record turnout and \r\nthe participation of people from all sections of our \r\nsociety. Most importantly, the elections produced \r\nelected bodies with a 41 per cent proportion of \r\nwomen. We remain committed to bridging the gap \r\nof the remaining 9 per cent to reach 50 per cent. The \r\nelections not only ensured the democratic rights of the \r\nNepali people in the widest possible manner, they also \r\nproduced the strongest Government for many years. \r\nThe Government that I lead has the support of more \r\nthan three quarters of our Parliament. Governments in \r\nthe provinces also enjoy strong majority support. We \r\nhave achieved much-needed political stability through \r\nthose landmark elections.\r\nWith those historic achievements, we have laid the \r\nfoundations for creating an egalitarian and just society, \r\nwhere all citizens are treated equally and receive equal \r\nprotection and opportunities. Social justice remains at \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 21/61\r\nthe centre of our polity. The United Nations and the \r\ninternational community supported our peace process, \r\nfor which we are grateful. Nepal’s case is a unique \r\nexample of a peaceful and democratic transformation. \r\nIt is telling testimony to the fact that dialogue triumphs \r\nover differences and ballots triumph over bullets. \r\nWe believe that what Nepal has achieved in conflict \r\ntransformation can be an inspiring success story for \r\nmany people longing for peace in various parts of \r\nthe world. We are willing to share our experiences and \r\nprovide our insights.\r\nWith hard lessons learned in the arduous journey of \r\ndemocratic transition, we have emerged as a confident \r\nnation capable of sustaining political gains while \r\nundertaking a course of economic transformation. \r\nCognizant of the need to accelerate the process of \r\ndevelopment, my Government has set a vision entitled \r\nProsperous Nepal and Happy Nepali. We will realize \r\nthat vision with the right mix of the prudent utilization \r\nof our natural resources and the optimal mobilization \r\nand management of the human resources with which \r\nwe are endowed. We count on the continued goodwill, \r\nsupport and cooperation of the international community \r\nin our development endeavours. Our foreign policy \r\nguides us to maintain amity with all and enmity \r\nwith none. It has shaped our independent outlook on \r\nglobal issues, which we consider on their merits. We \r\nbelieve that regional and global efforts complement our \r\nnational development efforts. In line with our foreign-\r\npolicy priority favouring regional cooperation, we \r\nrecently hosted the fourth summit of the Bay of Bengal \r\nInitiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic \r\nCooperation. We would like to see a revitalized South \r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation as an \r\nimportant regional organization.\r\nThe world today is at an important juncture with a \r\nunique juxtaposition of perils and promises. Challenges \r\nranging from poverty, terrorism, climate change, food \r\ninsecurity, forced displacement and natural disasters to \r\nan arms race continue to confront the global community. \r\nIntra-State conflicts have taken a heavy toll on millions \r\nof lives. For the first time in decades, world hunger \r\nis rising after a prolonged decline. In many regions, \r\npeace remains obscure. Inequality within nations, \r\nas well as among them, is increasing. Countries have \r\nfailed to adopt sustainable production and consumption \r\npatterns. In that regard, the theme of the general debate, \r\nentitled “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”, resonates \r\nwell with the needs of our time.\r\nNepal supports the seven priority areas that the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly eloquently outlined \r\nin her inaugural address (see A/73/PV.1) to the Assembly \r\nearlier this week. I hope that the current session will \r\nseriously deliberate on those priority areas with the \r\ngravity and urgency that they deserve. Therein lies our \r\npolitical will and determination. With that commitment, \r\nwe must ensure that the voice of the people struggling \r\nfor their rights, liberty, freedom and justice in various \r\nparts of the world, including Syria, Yemen, Palestine \r\nand many other places, is heard and addressed.\r\nThe endeavour to make the United Nations relevant \r\nto all people is well captured in the philosophy of leaving \r\nno one behind. Global efforts for the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in \r\nits third year appear too few and insufficient by far. \r\nNeedless to say, the least developed countries (LDCs) \r\nare the battleground on which the 2030 Agenda will be \r\nwon or lost. Development in the LDCs appears dismal \r\ndespite the global economy’s record performance. \r\nInternational support measures are failing to make \r\na dent.\r\nThe implementation of internationally agreed \r\ncommitments made to promote those commitments \r\nis far below our expectations. Reaching out first to \r\nthose furthest behind is not a luxury. It is not a charity \r\neither. It is an international obligation, duty and social \r\nresponsibility. The impact will be fully realized only \r\nwhen external support measures respect national \r\nownership and leadership, are aligned with national \r\npriorities and come through a national system. Such \r\nmeasures must work to build productive capacity, create \r\njobs and develop human resources. Only easy access \r\nto markets, the removal of trade barriers, the injection \r\nof financing and investments, the building of capacity \r\nand the transfer of technology, and the overcoming of \r\ninfrastructural bottlenecks can enable LDCs, especially \r\nlandlocked least developed countries, to take the path \r\nto sustainable development and integrate themselves \r\ninto global value chains.\r\nWith regard to climate change, the clock of caution \r\nis loudly ticking. The impact of climate change burdens \r\nthe poorest and most vulnerable countries, like my own \r\ncountry, Nepal, despite their negligible emissions of \r\ngreenhouse gases. We cannot remain a bystander when \r\nsnow-clad mountains, known as the water towers of the \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n22/61 18-30073\r\nworld, are receding, glaciers are retreating and erratic \r\nweather patterns are causing f loods and inundation in \r\nthe plains. It is an unpleasant irony that we have been \r\nthe victims of catastrophes that others have caused. The \r\nimpacts of climate change on mountainous and small \r\nisland countries are felt as an existential threat. The loss \r\nof lives, property and biodiversity and the increasing \r\nphenomenon of calamities are becoming untenable. \r\nA matching and robust response is required. We \r\ncannot evade the responsibility, nor will there be any \r\nexcuse for inaction. We must act decisively to ensure \r\nthat climate justice respects the principle of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities and respective \r\ncapabilities. To make that happen, international \r\ncooperation and collaboration to promote adaptation \r\nand mitigation are a sine qua non. The Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change must be implemented in its entirety \r\nand in good faith.\r\nThe health and well-being of our children and young \r\npeople are an investment in the future. Delivering quality \r\neducation, imparting skills and spurring innovation can \r\ntogether produce a virtuous composite force enabling \r\nyoung people to be relevant and able to contribute to \r\nsociety and nation-building. We must support the full \r\ndevelopment of their potential, creativity and energy \r\nto f lourish. Inculcating an entrepreneurial spirit and \r\ncreating decent job opportunities for youth can fuel \r\neconomic development and help positively transform \r\nour societies. At the same time, we must also inculcate \r\nthem with civil and moral values so that they become a \r\nforce for harmony and tolerance in society.\r\nThe frontiers of technology are ever expanding, \r\nand they have been a major driving force for societal \r\ntransformation. But the digital dividend is unevenly \r\ndistributed, and the digital divide is widening. \r\nTechnology has been a powerful agent of change and \r\ntransformation. At the same time, the technological \r\nrevolution is disruptive. The developing countries, \r\nespecially the LDCs, are struggling to cope with the \r\nnew modes of production and consumption. We must \r\ncreate an environment that can ensure easy access to \r\naffordable technology and remove barriers preventing \r\ntheir transfer. It should provide a level playing field for \r\nall countries so that they can benefit from and propel \r\neconomic growth through new technologies.\r\nThis year, the United Nations has taken the \r\nboldest reform initiatives in decades. The cross-pillar \r\nrestructuring of the Organization provides us with an \r\nimportant opportunity to strengthen its development \r\npillar and demonstrate its efficiency in delivery. We \r\nbelieve that a repositioned United Nations development \r\nsystem will better deliver on the 2030 Agenda. It is \r\nimportant that a new generation of country teams learn \r\nnew methods so that we can ensure a sound system, but, \r\nmore than that, the unlearning of old habits — which \r\ndemanded that we undertake this reform — is equally \r\nimportant. What matters also in the reform is the \r\ntransformation of the culture. The new culture must \r\ninclude accountability, transparency and national \r\nownership at its core. Nepal welcomes the reforms \r\nundertaken in the peace and security architecture, \r\nas well as in the management of the Organization. \r\nThe United Nations should reflect the mosaic of \r\nits membership and achieve greater efficiency and \r\neffectiveness. Security Council reform is long \r\noverdue. Any reform must reflect current realities and \r\nensure justice for historically underrepresented and \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nNepal reaffirms its principled stand for the general \r\nand complete disarmament of all weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. In that context, we welcome the recent \r\nefforts made by the United States and the two Koreas \r\ntowards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula \r\nand the establishment of peace and stability there. \r\nNepal welcomes the Secretary-General’s agenda for \r\ndisarmament with the hope of a renewed impetus \r\nfor disarmament. Nepal commends the beginning of \r\ndeliberations within the framework of the Kathmandu \r\nprocess for developing innovative confidence-building \r\nmeasures in the Asia-Pacific region. No region \r\nis immune from the menace of terrorism. Nepal \r\nstrongly condemns all acts of terrorism, committed \r\nby whomever and for whatever purposes. Nepal calls \r\nfor an early conclusion of a comprehensive convention \r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nNever has the issue of human mobility figured so \r\nprominently on the agenda of the United Nations. Nepal \r\nlooks forward to the December Intergovernmental \r\nConference to Adopt a Global Compact for Safe, \r\nOrderly and Regular Migration. Ensuring the human \r\nrights and the well-being of all migrant workers \r\nremains our priority. Nepal believes that the compact \r\nwill serve that purpose and make migration work for \r\nall. Nepal has hosted thousands of refugees for decades \r\non humanitarian grounds. The international community \r\nmust uphold the right of refugees to return to their \r\nhomeland safely and with full dignity.\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 23/61\r\nThe complexities and intractability of global \r\nconflicts render the current efforts to promote conflict \r\nprevention even more important. Mediation — an \r\nunderutilized tool — can be applicable in all phases of the \r\nconflict continuum. Nepal recently marked six decades \r\nof its partnership for peace with the United Nations. \r\nNepal has responded to every call, even on the shortest \r\nnotice and without national caveats. Nepal welcomes \r\nthe Secretary-General’s Action for Peacekeeping \r\ninitiativeand has endorsed the Declaration of Shared \r\nCommitments on United Nations Peacekeeping \r\nOperations. Troop- and police-contributing countries \r\nmust be provided with fair opportunities to serve in \r\nleadership positions, both at Headquarters and in field \r\nmissions. A sustained partnership for the capacity-\r\nbuilding of peacekeepers and providing for their safety \r\nand security can enhance the performance of peace \r\noperations. Nepal condemns attacks on peacekeepers. \r\nEnding the indignity of sexual exploitation and abuse \r\nis a must. Nonetheless, peace missions alone cannot be \r\na substitute for home-grown preventive and conflict-\r\nresolution measures. Our own experience demonstrates \r\nthat peacekeeping alone cannot do what politically \r\nnegotiated settlements can do.\r\nNepal’s commitment to the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights is total and unflinching. We \r\nhold development, democracy and respect for human \r\nrights as interdependent and mutually reinforcing. \r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, we will \r\ncontinue to play our constructive role in delivering \r\non the Council’s mandates. The ongoing transitional \r\njustice process in Nepal respects the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement between the Government of Nepal \r\nand the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), as well \r\nas the reality on the ground, in our efforts to sustain \r\npeace and deliver justice. We will not allow impunity in \r\ncases involving serious violations of human rights and \r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nWe are living in an uncertain world. Cold War \r\nrivalries are resurfacing. Trade tensions are mounting. \r\nMultilateralism is being questioned. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s opening statement largely captures the \r\nrealities of the contemporary world and the sentiment \r\nof Member States in the areas of peace and security, \r\nsustainable development, climate change, migration \r\nand technology. We underscore the centrality of the \r\nUnited Nations as the most legitimate multilateral \r\nforum in which to deliberate the challenges that we \r\nall confront globally. It is the obligation of all Member \r\nStates to preserve the sanctity of multilateralism and \r\nuphold respect for international law. The problems \r\nthat we are confronting today on a global scale can be \r\novercome only by global collaboration and partnership \r\nin absolute trust and confidence. We have yet to make \r\nan international system that is truly inclusive and \r\npromotes fairness, equality and justice for all States, \r\nboth big and small.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate Nepal’s profound \r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles enshrined \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations. We remain as firm \r\non that score as we have been for the past 63 years since \r\nwe joined the Organization. The onus of providing \r\nthe world with direction lies on us. Our collective \r\nwisdom and leadership should aim at the realization of \r\nthe aspirations of all for peace and prosperity. Let us \r\ncollectively resolve that the history of the twenty-first \r\ncentury shall not be written as one of confrontation, \r\nconflict, poverty, exclusion, underdevelopment, \r\ninjustice and exploitation. It should rather be a history \r\nof cooperation, harmony, prosperity, inclusion, \r\ndevelopment, justice and fairness.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of \r\nNepal for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. K. P. Sharma Oli, Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Nepal, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Public Utilities of \r\nTuvalu\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Public Utilities of Tuvalu.\r\nMr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Public Utilities of Tuvalu, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Enele \r\nSosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nPublic Utilities of Tuvalu, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Sapoaga (Tuvalu): It gives me great pleasure, \r\non behalf of the Government and the people of Tuvalu, \r\nto address the General Assembly and to congratulate \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n24/61 18-30073\r\nHer Excellency Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés \r\non her election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-third session. Tuvalu has full confidence in \r\nher leadership, which will, together with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s support, further advance our work in the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nTuvalu also reaffirms its commitment to the noble \r\nvalues and principles of the United Nations, of which \r\nTuvalu has great pride in being a Member since it joined \r\nin 2000. We also want to acknowledge with sincere \r\naffection the passing of the late Kofi Annan, former \r\nSecretary-General, and his outstanding contributions \r\nto the work of this body while leading us from the dusk \r\nof the previous century into the dawn of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, which included the considered admission \r\nof my country to this great Organization.\r\nWe welcome the critical theme of the current \r\ngeneral debate, “Making the United Nations relevant for \r\nall people: global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. \r\nIt rightly reminds us that we now need responsible \r\nglobal leadership more than ever — leadership that \r\nvalues multilateralism and trust and takes seriously \r\nthe moral responsibility to help those who need help. \r\nThat is the leadership that the world needs in order to \r\nsucceed against the defining global challenges facing \r\nthe United Nations, in particular in connection with \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the \r\nrole of that Agenda in combating climate change and \r\nenvironmental degradation.\r\nThis year was characterized by the fear of a \r\npotential nuclear war, as if we had not learned from \r\nthe wrongs of our past. Now we have nuclear weapons \r\nthat are much more powerful than those dropped on \r\nHiroshima and Nagasaki. Numerous nuclear tests in \r\nour Pacific region have caused unimaginable damage \r\nto the environment and the health of our people. Some \r\nof our islands continue to cope with the effects of \r\nnuclear radiation decades after those tests. The recent \r\nPacific Islands Leaders Meeting in Nauru reaffirmed \r\nour commitment to peace and security in the Pacific \r\nregion. In the Boe Declaration on Regional Security \r\nfor the Pacific region we called for urgent actions \r\nwith regard to not only military, but also human \r\nsecurity issues. In that spirit, two days ago, Tuvalu \r\nsigned the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, \r\nwhich provides the international community with an \r\nopportunity to ban such weapons. We urge all to take \r\nconcrete actions to make our world safe.\r\nNon-communicable diseases and tuberculosis hit \r\nthe poor and vulnerable particularly hard and drive \r\nthem deeper into poverty. We commend the successful \r\noutcomes of the high-level meetings of the General \r\nAssembly on those issues, but rhetoric alone is not \r\nenough. It must be followed by meaningful action on \r\nthe ground to promote healthy lifestyles and diets, \r\nsupported by adequate financing and monitoring \r\nmodalities so as to ensure integrated progress. \r\nAddressing that issue urgently is critical, and to that \r\nend we in Tuvalu have introduced healthy lifestyles with \r\nour initiative of afternoon sweat-breaks every Friday \r\nprovided to all workers in places of work and villages \r\nto encourage a more active and healthier lifestyle. We \r\nneed practical support, however, in the form of funding \r\nand resources from the United Nations, as well as the \r\ninternational community.\r\nFor small island developing States (SIDS) and \r\nleast developed countries, the achievement of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals depends entirely on \r\nhow we address issues of climate change. The current \r\nglobal warming trend spells a very bleak and miserable \r\nfuture for small island developing States, especially for \r\nlow-lying atolls such as Tuvalu — a future that demands \r\nhuge investments in mitigation and adaptation that are \r\nsimply beyond our capabilities. The Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change offers us a lifeline.\r\nBut the current commitments contained in the Paris \r\nAgreement constitute only a third of what is required \r\nin order to avoid the catastrophic consequences of \r\nclimate change, which poses a direct threat to our \r\nexistence and survival. As already established by the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), \r\nunless the global community steps up its actions to \r\nsignificantly lower greenhouse-gas emissions, SIDS \r\nlike Tuvalu will disappear completely within the next \r\n30 to 50 years — disappear completely. I repeat once \r\nagain what I said at the twenty-first Conference of \r\nParties in Paris: “Just imagine if you were in my shoes, \r\nhow you would feel. And what would you do?”\r\nClimate change is a weapon of mass destruction. \r\nIt is slaughtering fellow human beings throughout the \r\nworld. The United Nations cannot and must not allow \r\nthe biggest greenhouse-gas emitters to turn away from \r\ntheir moral duty and responsibility to urgently reduce \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions and to save SIDS like Tuvalu \r\nby providing the appropriate adaptation support and \r\nresources. It would be shameful if all of humankind \r\nallowed Tuvalu to disappear. Every single year wasted \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 25/61\r\nwith no action taken on climate change draws Tuvalu a \r\nyear closer to its total demise on Earth.\r\nBut Tuvalu will never give up. We will fight to \r\nprotect and save our islands, our people, our culture \r\nand our future. We appeal to this noble Assembly not \r\nto allow such consequences to happen. Tuvalu, whose \r\nislands and lagoons were used by the American forces \r\nin the Second World War to conquer the enemy in the \r\nPacific, urges President Trump and the United States \r\nof America to rejoin the Paris Agreement so that we \r\ncan all paddle together to save the world against our \r\nsingle most threatening enemy, namely, climate \r\nchange. Failing that, Tuvalu proposes that we, the \r\nsignatories of the Paris Agreement, quickly return to \r\nParis to critically and urgently reassess our mitigation \r\npledges and dramatically increase our efforts to reduce \r\ngreenhouse-gas pollution. We cannot allow one country \r\nto desert the process and derail our collective efforts.\r\nThe next Conference of Parties in Poland is a \r\ncritically important milestone for climate-change \r\naction. We must ensure that the implementation \r\nguidelines for the Paris Agreement are concluded. We \r\nmust also ensure that the Talanoa Dialogue process \r\nleads to a strong political declaration and decision that \r\nrespond adequately to the IPCC 1.5°C report and set \r\na pathway for enhanced climate-change action. In that \r\nregard, we seek a commitment from every nation to \r\nenhance its efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions \r\nas a matter of urgency. We in Tuvalu are fully committed \r\nto shifting to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2020 \r\ndespite our negligible greenhouse-gas emissions.\r\nI extend our deep appreciation to the Governments \r\nof India and France for their initiative on solar-energy \r\ndevelopment as part of the International Solar Alliance \r\nand to the European Union, New Zealand, Taiwan, Italy, \r\nAustria, Japan and the World Bank for their support for \r\nenergy efficiency and solar-energy development in my \r\ncountry, Tuvalu. I wish to acknowledge the efforts of \r\nnotable members of the Security Council in bringing \r\nclimate change to the fore of its peace and security \r\nagenda. That represents a genuine commitment to \r\naddressing the most important challenges of our \r\ntime and the greatest single threat to humankind. It \r\nis our humble hope that the entire Security Council \r\nmembership can agree to include climate change as a \r\npermanent agenda item.\r\nWe believe that the nexus between climate change \r\nand security is fundamental. For a nation like Tuvalu, \r\nsecurity and the future are contingent upon urgent \r\naction to address climate change. We therefore reiterate \r\nour call for the appointment of a special representative \r\nof the Secretary-General on climate change and \r\nsecurity. We also call on the Security Council to appoint \r\na special rapporteur to produce a regular review of \r\nglobal, regional and national security threats caused by \r\nclimate change.\r\nWe welcome the successful conclusion of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiation on the global compact \r\nfor safe, orderly and regular migration and commend \r\nthe spirit of responsible leadership and multilateral \r\ncooperation extended to efforts to support the ever-\r\nincreasing populations that are being affected by \r\nconflicts and environmental crises, We believe, \r\nhowever, that all human rights of people displaced as \r\na result of climate change should be protected under \r\nan international legal agreement. We therefore reiterate \r\nTuvalu’s proposal for a United Nations resolution on the \r\nestablishment of a legal process to protect the human \r\nrights of people displaced by climate change.\r\nThis year, Tuvalu proposed that it remain a least \r\ndeveloped country, because its ability to achieve \r\nsustainable development is being severely compromised \r\nby its vulnerability to climate change. We noted with \r\nappreciation the support that we have received from \r\ndevelopment partners and friends to advance that \r\nproposal. However, it is our earnest belief that the \r\nunique and extreme vulnerabilities of small island \r\ndeveloping States must be considered as a fundamental \r\ncriterion for graduation.\r\nThe particular concerns of highly vulnerable SIDS, \r\nlike Tuvalu, cannot be ignored. In our national strategy \r\nfor sustainable development — Te Kakeega — our \r\nunique vulnerability is recognized as enemy number \r\none hampering our efforts to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. In that regard, we call on the \r\nEconomic and Social Council to create a special \r\ncategory for SIDS so that we can be afforded special \r\nconsiderations in a similar fashion to those received \r\nby the least developed countries. We note the recently \r\nreleased report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nassessment resulting from the evolving mandates of the \r\nsmall island developing States units of the Secretariat \r\n(A/73/345). The expanded responsibilities of the \r\nSIDS unit in the Department of Economic and Social \r\nAffairs and the Office of the High Representative \r\nfor the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked \r\nDeveloping Countries and Small Island Developing \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n26/61 18-30073\r\nStates should be matched with expanded resources. \r\nWe also welcome the review of the SIDS Accelerated \r\nModalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway and hope \r\nthat that review will truly reflect and respond to the \r\nunique circumstances affecting SIDS and their unique \r\neconomic, environmental and social vulnerability. In \r\nthe South Pacific region, we are taking small steps \r\nto address that vulnerability. We are in the process of \r\ndeveloping a Pacific Island climate-change insurance \r\nfacility. We seek support from the United Nations-wide \r\nsystem to assist us in developing that facility.\r\nOur small-island economy is inextricably linked to \r\nthe oceans. The oceans are what we are, our culture, our \r\nlife and our survival, but global warming, acidification, \r\ncoral bleaching, solid wastes and plastic pollution and \r\ndiminishing inshore and offshore stocks of fisheries, \r\non which national economies depend, are gravely \r\naffecting the oceans. The United Nations must provide \r\nthe strongest possible leadership to drive genuine \r\npartnerships to address those issues.\r\nThe exclusion of Taiwan from the United Nations \r\nsystem has denied its 23 million people the enjoyment \r\nof their fundamental rights to participate in and benefit \r\nfrom the United Nations. Taiwan is already a responsible \r\nand able partner with Tuvalu and many other countries \r\nin many regions of the world, and could do even more if \r\nit were allowed to assume its rightful place and role in \r\nour global efforts to achieve sustainable development. \r\nTuvalu believes that the United Nations has to make the \r\narrangements necessary to enable Taiwan to participate \r\nin meetings, activities and mechanisms within the \r\nframework of United Nations processes, including those \r\nof the relevant United Nations specialized agencies. \r\nIn a similar vein, we believe that the long-standing \r\nunilateral economic embargo on trade with Cuba \r\ndirectly constrains the development aspirations of the \r\npeople of that country. It neglects the human rights and \r\nthe spirit of cooperation espoused by the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. Likewise, we believe that \r\nthe United Nations must also engage with the people of \r\nWest Papua to find lasting solutions to their struggles.\r\nIn August 2019, Tuvalu will host the fiftieth Pacific \r\nIslands Forum of leaders. I extend our humble invitation \r\nto all Pacific Island Forum leaders, our friends and \r\nespecially our bilateral and multilateral development \r\npartners to join us in Tuvalu. It will still be there, I \r\nhope. We want to put on record our deepest appreciation \r\nto the Government of Taiwan for their generous support \r\nin helping us prepare for that important and large-scale \r\nregional event. Similarly, I want to acknowledge similar \r\nsupport from the Governments of India, Taiwan, and \r\nthe Republic of Korea in helping us host the next \r\nyear’s Forum.\r\nOn 1 October, next Monday, Tuvalu will celebrate \r\nits fortieth anniversary of independence. While holding \r\nhigh our national pride as an independent nation, we \r\nfully acknowledge that Tuvalu could never have achieved \r\nsuch status without the due consideration of Members \r\nof this body, to whom, on behalf of the people of \r\nTuvalu, I now offer our sincere gratitude. In our striding \r\nforward, we acknowledge with deep appreciation, the \r\ngenerosity of all our development partners, particularly \r\nour traditional partners: the Republic of China, Taiwan, \r\nIndia, the Republic of Korea, Australia, New Zealand, \r\nthe European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, the \r\nWorld Bank, the Asian Development Bank and many \r\nothers. As we paddle our canoe forward for the next 40 \r\nyears, we seek the continuing goodwill of the United \r\nNations family to further advance our achievements \r\nbased on genuine and durable partnerships.\r\nIn conclusion, Tuvalu strongly believes that its \r\ncollective effort to achieve the aspirations of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and to secure \r\nglobal peace, security and prosperity will be severely \r\ncompromised unless we all paddle together, as a \r\nfamily, to urgently address climate change and save \r\nTuvalu and the world. God bless Tuvalu. God bless the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank Mr. Enele \r\nSosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nPublic Utilities of Tuvalu, for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Public Utilities of Tuvalu, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of \r\nthe People’s Republic of Bangladesh\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 27/61\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Sheikh \r\nHasina, Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of \r\nBangladesh, and inviting her to address the Assembly.\r\nSheikh Hasina (Bangladesh) (spoke in Bangla; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation): \r\nLet me congratulate the President on her election as \r\nthe fourth female President of the General Assembly \r\nduring its 73 years of history. I wish to assure her of my \r\ndelegation’s full support in upholding her commitment \r\nto the United Nations.\r\nI also congratulate Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres on his firm and courageous \r\nleadership in promoting global peace, security and \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe theme chosen for this year’s session brings \r\nback some personal memories for me. Forty-four years \r\nago, my father, the father of the nation, Bangabandhu \r\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman, stood at this rostrum and said\r\n“Peace is an imperative for the survival of \r\nmankind. It represents the deepest aspirations of \r\nmen and women throughout the world.” (A/PV.2243, \r\npara.15).\r\nThe United Nations remains the centre of hope for the \r\nfuture of all people in this world of sadness, misery \r\nand conflict. My father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur \r\nRahman, devoted his life to the socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment of the people of Bangladesh. He did so at a \r\ntime when 90 per cent of the population lived below the \r\npoverty line. Following 24 years of struggle culminating \r\nin the victory of our Liberation War, Bangladesh gained \r\nindependence under his leadership in 1971. During \r\nthat long period of struggle, he spent almost 14 years \r\nin prison. There were plots to assassinate him time \r\nand again.\r\nFollowing independence, Bangabandhu directed \r\nhis strength to rebuilding a war-ravaged country \r\nwith a ruined economy. The people had a great need \r\nfor relief. Bangladesh set out on its journey as a least \r\ndeveloped country (LDC). Yet, misfortune befell our \r\npeople. Bangabandhu would lead the country for only \r\nthree and a half years. He was brutally gunned down \r\nby assassins on 15 August 1975. Along with him, 18 \r\nmembers of my family, among them my mother Begum \r\nFazilatunnesa, three brothers, the youngest only 10 \r\nyears of age, and two newly wed sisters-in-law, were \r\nalso killed. My sister Sheikh Rehana and I happened to \r\nbe abroad at the time and survived the mayhem. But we \r\nwere barred from returning to the country. The military \r\ndictator who seized power at the time promulgated the \r\nIndemnity Ordinance, which blocked the possibility of \r\nbringing the killers to justice. We were denied the right \r\nto seek justice for the gruesome murders.\r\nI feel the pain and suffering of countless people \r\naround the world, like the Rohingya, persecuted and \r\nexpelled from their homes. It is impossible to build \r\npeaceful, just and sustainable societies by ignoring \r\nsuch situations. The Myanmar situation repeatedly \r\nreminds us of the genocide committed by the Pakistani \r\noccupation forces against our people in 1971. During \r\nthe nine months of our Liberation War, Pakistanis killed \r\n3 million innocent Bengalis. Two hundred thousand \r\nwomen had to suffer heinous torture and abuse. Ten \r\nmillion people had to f lee their homes and take refuge \r\nin India. My father was arrested and taken to Pakistan. \r\nI was also taken prisoner along with my mother, two \r\nyounger brothers and a sister. I was expecting my first \r\nchild at the time. He was born in captivity. We had \r\nto spend our days in a damp, unhealthy environment. \r\nWe are appalled by what we have seen in United \r\nNations reports about atrocities committed against the \r\nRohingya, who have now taken shelter in Bangladesh. \r\nSuch atrocities are tantamount to genocide and \r\ncrimes against humanity. We expect the international \r\ncommunity, in particular the United Nations, to give \r\ndue importance to the atrocities and injustice suffered \r\nby the Rohingya population in Myanmar.\r\nAs fellow human beings, we can neither ignore nor \r\nremain silent about the plight of the Rohingya. When \r\nmy father and family members were killed, I was not \r\nallowed to return home for six years. My sister and I \r\nwere compelled to live abroad as refugees. I can feel \r\nthe misery of losing one’s loved ones and of living in \r\na different land as a refugee. Therefore, I presented a \r\nfive-point proposal at the General Assembly last year \r\n(see A/72/PV.14), with a view to finding a durable \r\nand peaceful solution to the suffering of the forcibly \r\ndisplaced and hapless Rohingya. We are disappointed \r\nthat, despite our earnest efforts, we have not been able \r\nto begin Rohingya repatriation in a permanent and \r\nsustainable manner.\r\nMyanmar is one of our neighbours. From the outset, \r\nwe have been trying to find a peaceful solution to the \r\nRohingya crisis through bilateral consultations. So \r\nfar, three bilateral arrangements have been concluded \r\nbetween Bangladesh and Myanmar for Rohingya \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n28/61 18-30073\r\nrepatriation. Despite their verbal commitment to take \r\nback the Rohingya, in reality the Myanmar authorities \r\nhave yet to accept them back. The 1.1 million Rohingya \r\nhosted in Bangladesh are living in an uncertain situation. \r\nTo the best of our ability, we have made arrangements \r\nfor their food, clothing, health care, childcare and \r\nsecurity. Many countries and organizations, including \r\nthe United Nations, the Commonwealth and the \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation, have shown \r\nsolidarity with the Rohingya and extended support and \r\nassistance to them. I extend my appreciation and thanks \r\nto the international community\r\nAs long as the Rohingya are unable to return home, \r\nthey should, as a temporary arrangement, be able to live \r\nin good and healthy conditions. With that in mind, we \r\nhave started working on a new housing facility for them \r\nwith all arrangements necessary for their education, \r\nhealth care and other needs. I call upon international \r\norganizations to join hands with us in that initiative. I \r\nalso seek their assistance to help relocate the Rohingya \r\nto the facility. The Rohingya crisis had its origin in \r\nMyanmar. As such, its solution has to be found in \r\nMyanmar. We also wish to see an immediate and \r\neffective implementation of the agreement concluded \r\nbetween Myanmar and the United Nations. We want an \r\nearly, peaceful solution to the Rohingya crisis.\r\nOver the past 30 years, Bangladesh has made its \r\ncontribution to international peace by deploying more \r\nthan 158,000 peacekeepers in 54 missions. A total of \r\n145 peacekeepers from Bangladesh have made their \r\nsupreme sacrifice in the line of duty. Currently, more \r\nthan 7,000 peacekeepers, including 144 women, are \r\ndeployed in 10 different missions. Our peacekeepers \r\nhave been acclaimed for their professionalism, courage \r\nand success. We pledged 23 contingents under the \r\nPeacekeeping Capability Readiness System.\r\nAs one of the original proponents, Bangladesh \r\nhoped to see a more robust and human rights-centric \r\nglobal compact on safe, regular and orderly migration. \r\nIn the contemporary global context, the migration \r\ncompact should be considered a positive step and \r\nshould serve as a living document for protecting the \r\nrights of migrants.\r\nBangladesh stands firm against terrorism and all \r\norganized crime. We shall not allow our territory to be \r\nused for any terrorist acts against our neighbours or for \r\nany activity detrimental to their interests. Our zero-\r\ntolerance policy in countering terrorism will continue \r\nundiminished. Our whole-of-society approach has \r\nserved us well in preventing violent extremism, human \r\ntrafficking and the f low of illicit drugs. Bangladesh \r\nhas aligned itself with the Global Call to Action on the \r\nWorld Drug Problem sponsored by the United States.\r\nSince 2009, we have been implementing inclusive \r\nand people-centric development policies. On our \r\nway to realizing Shonar Bangla or Golden Bengal, as \r\nenvisioned by our father of the nation Bangabandhu \r\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman, we remain committed to \r\nfulfilling our people’s aspirations. The World Bank \r\nrecognized Bangladesh as a middle-income country in \r\n2015. Bangladesh is the forty-third largest economy in \r\nthe world in terms of nominal gross domestic product \r\n(GDP). Our per capita income has increased from $543 \r\nin 2006 to $1,752 in 2018. We have achieved an average \r\nGDP growth of 7.86 per cent. Inflation has decreased by \r\n5.4 per cent. The poverty rate has dropped from 41.5 per \r\ncent in 2006 to 21.4 per cent in 2018. During the same \r\nperiod, extreme poverty has decreased from 24 per cent \r\nto 11.3 per cent. Our foreign-exchange reserves totalled \r\n$7.5 billion in the 2008/2009 fiscal year and increased \r\nto $32.2 billion in 2018. Public investment stood at \r\n4.3 per cent of GDP in 2009 and rose to 8.2 per cent \r\nin 2018.\r\nPower-generation capacity has increased to 20,000 \r\nmegawatts from 3,000 megawatts in 2009. We are \r\nbuilding supercritical coal-based power-generation \r\nplants to ensure a sustainable power supply. In remote \r\nareas without transmission lines, the power supply is \r\nbeing ensured with the help of 5.5 million solar panels. \r\nNinety per cent of our population now has access to \r\nelectricity. With the launch of the work on the Rooppur \r\nnuclear power plant, we have moved a step ahead in the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nBangladesh is now recognized as a global \r\ndevelopment model. We have commenced our journey \r\nfrom being an LDC to acquiring the status of a \r\ndeveloping country. The pathway for graduation is \r\ninextricably linked to our implementation strategy for \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is \r\nintegrated into our seventh five-year plan. We remain \r\nfully committed to implementing the SDGs.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of our current economic \r\ngrowth, there are now immense and large-scale business \r\nopportunities in Bangladesh. Foreign investors are being \r\noffered various financial incentives like tax holidays, \r\ndouble taxation agreements and duty-free exemptions. \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 29/61\r\nWe are setting up 100 special economic zones to help \r\ncreate 10 million job opportunities in Bangladesh.\r\nAs a follow-up to my role as a member of the \r\nHigh-level Panel on Water, we remain committed to \r\nimplementing the outcome of the Panel, which was \r\nformed under the joint initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the World Bank President. I urge world \r\nleaders to take urgent actions on the proper appraisal \r\nand management of and investment in water. We shall \r\nbe held responsible by future generations if we fail to \r\ndo so. My Government remains committed to ensuring \r\nsafe drinking water and sanitation for all through the \r\nachievement of SDG 6. As of now, 99 per cent of our \r\npeople have access to sanitation and 88 per cent to safe \r\ndrinking water.\r\nUnder our social safety-net programmes, 6.5 million \r\nelderly men and women, widows, destitute women and \r\npersons with disabilities receive regular allowances. \r\nSince 2010, students have received free textbooks from \r\npre-primary up to secondary levels in school. A total \r\nof 354.92 million books have been distributed among \r\n43.76 million students this year. Vision-impaired \r\nstudents receive books in Braille. Children from ethnic \r\nminorities are given books in their mother tongues. \r\nApproximately 20.03 million students from the primary \r\nto the graduate level receive stipends. Stipend money \r\nfor 14 million students is sent directly to their mothers \r\nthrough mobile phones. We have ensured 100 per cent \r\nenrolment at the primary level. The literacy rate has \r\nincreased from 45 per cent to 72.9 per cent over the past \r\nnine and half years.\r\nOur home-grown, innovative socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment models have gained broad popular \r\nacceptance. Micro-savings programmes have been \r\nintroduced for rural, marginalized communities \r\nthrough the One House, One Farm project. The amount \r\nsaved by beneficiaries in their individual accounts is \r\nmatched by the Government. The Shelter Project is \r\nbeing implemented with the aim of ensuring that no one \r\nis homeless in Bangladesh. We are working to provide \r\neach of our villages with urban facilities.\r\nWomen’s empowerment and participation have \r\nbeen a major factor in Bangladesh’s outstanding \r\ndevelopment. We have promoted women’s empowerment \r\nby enhancing their education opportunities and \r\nfacilitating their political and economic emancipation. \r\nWe have created opportunities for girls to pursue their \r\neducation free of cost up to the twelfth grade in public \r\neducational institutions. At the secondary level, the \r\nratio of girls to boys is 53 to 47. In early 2009, it was \r\n35 to 65. Bangladesh is perhaps the only country in the \r\nworld where in its national Parliament, the Speaker of \r\nthe House, the Leader of the House, the Deputy Leader \r\nof the House and the Leader of the Opposition are all \r\nwomen. In the present Parliament, there are 72 elected \r\nfemale members. Thirty-three per cent of seats are \r\nearmarked for women in local Government bodies in \r\norder to promote women’s political empowerment at \r\nthe grass-roots level. Approximately 20 million women \r\nare employed in the agricultural, service and industrial \r\nsectors. Women constitute 80 per cent of the 4.5 million \r\nworkers engaged in the garment sector, which is our \r\nlargest exports earner. Women entrepreneurs are \r\noffered collateral-free bank loans with a 5 per cent \r\nservice charge. Ten per cent of the small entrepreneurs \r\nfund and 10 per cent of industrial plots are earmarked \r\nfor women entrepreneurs.\r\nBangladesh is one of the most densely populated \r\ncountries in the world. More than 160 million people \r\nnow live in a land area of only 147,570 square \r\nkilometres. Despite our resource constraints, we \r\nhave made significant strides across a range of social \r\nindices. The maternal mortality rate has decreased \r\nto 170 per 1,000, and the mortality rate of children \r\nunder the age of five has decreased to 28 per 1,000. \r\nLife expectancy has increased to 72 years from 64 \r\nyears in 2009. In the past fiscal year, we spent 5.9 per \r\ncent of our national budget in the public health sector. \r\nThis year, investment in health has increased by 17 per \r\ncent. With approximately 18,000 community health \r\nclinics and union health centres operating, health care \r\nhas reached our people’s doorsteps. Thirty different \r\ntypes of medicines are being distributed free of cost. \r\nTuberculosis prevention and control efforts have been \r\nintensified so as to reach the 2030 Agenda SDG target. \r\nAs a result, tuberculosis-related deaths have decreased \r\nby 19 per cent in the past two years.\r\nBangladesh has also been playing a pioneering role \r\nin raising awareness about the needs of children affected \r\nby autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. In \r\norder to further consolidate our efforts in that regard, \r\na specialized cell is being created in the Ministry \r\nof Health and Family Welfare. A National Steering \r\nCommittee and a National Advisory Committee \r\nhave already been set up. Saima Hossain Wazed, the \r\nChairperson of the Advisory Committee and a member \r\nof the World Health Organisation’s Expert Advisory \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n30/61 18-30073\r\nPanel on Mental Health, has been named a Goodwill \r\nAmbassador for South Asia on that issue.\r\nWe welcome the formation of the Secretary \r\nGeneral’s High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation. \r\nThe underlying premise of our vision for a digital \r\nBangladesh is to promote people’s well-being. The \r\nwidespread introduction of Internet-based public-\r\nservice delivery has led to a growth in job creation at \r\nthe grass-roots level. The idea of a digital Bangladesh \r\nhas taken shape. We have made our foray into the world \r\nof space technology by launching our own satellite, \r\nBangabandhu I, making Bangladesh the fifty-seventh \r\ncountry in the world to have done so. It was in fact a \r\ndream of our Father of the Nation that we would one \r\nday reach outer space. The launching of that satellite \r\nhelped us realize the aspiration he instilled in us when \r\nhe set up the country’s first satellite ground station on \r\n14 June 1975.\r\nBangladesh is one of the 10 most climate-vulnerable \r\ncountries in the world. Its topography, coupled with \r\nits high population density, has made the country \r\nparticularly vulnerable to climate-change risks. \r\nBangladesh remains committed to implementing \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We are \r\nspending over 1 per cent of our gross domestic product \r\non addressing climate-change impacts. We are also \r\npromoting climate-resilient agriculture. Initiatives have \r\nbeen taken to increase tree coverage from 22 to 24 per \r\ncent in the next five years. A project worth $50 million \r\nis being implemented for the conservation of the \r\nSundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest and \r\na UNESCO World Heritage Site. We have integrated \r\nour development programmes and our efforts to build \r\ncapacity to combat climate change into a mega-project \r\nentitled Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. It is a water-\r\ncentric, multi-sectoral, technoeconomic plan with a \r\nlong-term time frame. It was developed bearing in mind \r\nthe local geomorphology and global climate-change \r\nimpact. Bangladesh is the only country in the world that \r\nhas adopted such a long-term development plan — it \r\nspans 82 years.\r\nWe are shocked by the continued violation of the \r\nrights of the brotherly people of Palestine. That must \r\ncome to an end. As Chair of the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers, we \r\nshall continue to work with the international community \r\nto resolve the Palestinian question. There are three \r\nelements that play the most critical parts in advancing \r\nhuman civilization: peace, humanity and development. \r\nFor the well-being of human societies, we must continue \r\nto strive for humankind. Our main objective must be \r\nto serve the people and ensure their well-being. It is \r\nhumanity and goodwill that can take us forward on the \r\npathway to sustainable development. In a world faced \r\nwith a myriad of challenges, our common interest, \r\nshared responsibility and sustainable partnership are \r\nour best bet for preserving human civilization.\r\nAll my life, I have been working to make a difference \r\nin the lives of my people. In the past nine and a half \r\nyears, Bangladesh has achieved remarkable success \r\nin various socioeconomic sectors. The Bangladesh \r\nthat the world knew as a land plagued by disasters, \r\nf loods, droughts and hunger has achieved wonders in \r\nmaintaining international peace, managing disasters, \r\nempowering women and consolidating development \r\ngains. Bangladesh has now surpassed its neighbours in \r\nSouth Asia on a number of indicators. But our journey \r\nhas not reached its end. It will continue until the day \r\nwe can build a Bangladesh free of hunger, poverty, \r\nilliteracy and exploitation — the Shonar Bangladesh \r\nof our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh \r\nMujibur Rahman. Joy Bangla, Joy Bangabandhu, may \r\nBangladesh live forever!\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh \r\nfor the statement she has just made.\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón, \r\nPresident of the Government of the Kingdom of \r\nSpain\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón, President of the \r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain.\r\nMr. Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón, President \r\nof the Government of the Kingdom of Spain, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón, President of the \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 31/61\r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Sánchez Pérez-Castejón (Spain) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I have the honour to address the General \r\nAssembly as President of the Government of the \r\nKingdom of Spain. I do so with the emotion that this \r\nHall inspires in me and with respect for the values \r\nthat gave rise to and guide the daily work of the \r\nOrganization. I would like to begin by highlighting the \r\nfact that, for the first time in history, a Latin American \r\nwoman is presiding over the Assembly. That is yet \r\nanother symbol of the fact that global governance in \r\nthe twenty-first century is inconceivable without the \r\nleadership of women. I identify as a feminist politician, \r\nand this is without a doubt the time of women.\r\nI have always believed that multilateralism makes \r\nit possible to achieve heights that would be unattainable \r\nthrough the individual actions of States. On that note, I \r\nwant to underscore the value of agreement and dialogue \r\nin confronting the challenges that the international \r\ncommunity is facing. Those are challenges that my \r\ncountry, Spain, is addressing with a spirit of hope \r\nfor collective action against those who instil fear and \r\nuncertainty. Our commitment to the United Nations \r\nstems from common values and a common conviction; \r\nit is the pursuit of justice in all its forms through respect \r\nfor human dignity, democracy, freedom, equality and \r\nhuman rights; and now, above all and more than ever, it \r\nis making the promotion of peace and the well-being of \r\npeoples our objectives.\r\nThe United Nations, like the European project in \r\nwhich my Government firmly believes, was not born \r\nout of an idealistic utopia, as some disdainfully make it \r\nout to be. It was born out of victory over the forces of \r\nhatred, racism and tyranny. Today, the world is facing \r\ngreat global challenges, many of which have been \r\ndiscussed here in the Assembly. We are asked to act on \r\nbehalf of the people of each of our countries. We are \r\nasked and required to prepare real agendas for change. \r\nOur times do not require nationalistic or non-inclusive \r\nrhetoric. To paraphrase the remarks of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral at the opening of the general debate (see A/73/\r\nPV.6), now is the moment to forge a new cooperative \r\nleadership, based on a willingness not only to listen \r\nto others, which is of course important, but also to \r\nunderstand what motivates their positions. Now is the \r\nmoment to accept, with a deep sense of empathy, that no \r\none alone has a monopoly on the truth; and that we need \r\nleadership that can build consensus, forge agreements \r\nand find solutions that leverage synergies.\r\nWe must not underestimate everything that we \r\nhave achieved by working together, which is very \r\nsignificant. The world today is a better place than it \r\nused to be. It is much better than it would have been \r\nif the United Nations had never been founded. But in \r\nmy opinion, the real strength of the Organization does \r\nnot lie in its past achievements, although there have \r\nbeen many; rather, it lies in all that we can build to win \r\nthe future. The time is now. We are the last generation \r\nwith the opportunity to slow the consequences of \r\nclimate change and the first generation with the tools \r\nto eradicate poverty on the planet. It is, therefore, not \r\na question of seeing obstacles but rather, of seeing \r\nopportunities. It is about turning change into a catalyst \r\nfor achieving sustainable development. That it is not \r\nan ideal. It is a real necessity, as many of the previous \r\nspeakers have stated.\r\n       Many countries face a dilemma: to continue to \r\nbe open societies or to become closed societies, as if \r\na return to the false peace of borders and renouncing \r\ncollective action were the only means of addressing the \r\nuncertainties of these times. We already know where \r\nsuch ideas lead. Now we must look beyond the seeming \r\ndictates of these fast-moving times,  in which everything \r\nseems to change from one minute to the next. Let us \r\nmove past the lost decade of the economic crisis and \r\nthe growing inequality that our societies suffer from. \r\nOur commitment has a name, a date and goals — the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, to which \r\nthe Government of Spain is fully committed.\r\n      The late Kofi Annan, to whom I wish to pay tribute, \r\ntaught us many things. I should like to share one of \r\nthem with the Assembly. He told us that human rights, \r\nsocial and economic development and security are all \r\ninterdependent. I would like to recall those pillars, \r\naccompanied by an additional thought — that the \r\ndignity of human beings must also be at the heart of \r\nour public and political action. The principles that have \r\nbrought us to this point in our history are not in retreat \r\nand never will be. In fact, they are more relevant than \r\never. That is why Spain will continue to defend those \r\nvalues. Because without dignity and equality between \r\nwomen and men, and without respect for human rights, \r\nthere will be no peace and development throughout \r\nthe world.\r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n32/61 18-30073\r\n      As a member of the Human Rights Council until \r\n2020, Spain supports initiatives that strengthen the \r\ncapacity of the Council and the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights. We are fortunate to have, in the person \r\nof the High Commissioner, an individual  of political \r\nand personal stature — Michelle Bachelet of Chile. \r\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which \r\ncelebrates its seventieth anniversary this year, provides \r\nthe framework for moving forward.\r\n      There is no greater injustice than that which defines \r\nwhat a human being will or will not be on the basis \r\nof whether they were born a boy or a girl. How do we \r\nmeasure all that so many generations of our societies \r\nhave lost by accepting the discrimination between \r\nmen and women? Humankind must not tolerate that \r\ninjustice. We must develop a truly global road map \r\nin this twenty-first century to eradicate all forms of \r\ndiscrimination, which women still suffer just because \r\nthey are women — whether it is gender-based violence, \r\ntrafficking in women, or female genital mutilation. \r\nIn that endeavour, the United Nations can rely on \r\nSpain’s commitment.\r\n      The Cabinet of Ministers, which I lead, comprises \r\n60 per cent women members, because we aim to lead by \r\nexample. And the battle is being fought in companies, in \r\neducation, in society itself and in leadership positions, \r\nwhere glass ceilings remain simply owing to slow \r\nprogress. I would like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on having reached full gender parity in his \r\nSenior Management Group for the first time in the \r\nhistory of the United Nations.\r\n     Spain will continue to promote the women and \r\npeace and security agenda. It is crucial that women \r\nparticipate as peace brokers in all phases of conflicts \r\nand contribute to a resolution. We will continue to \r\nsupport the outstanding  work of UN-Women. Spain \r\nactively participated in its creation and was the first \r\ndonor to establish a partnership framework with that \r\norganization. My Government has also joined a Circle \r\nof Leadership promoted by the Secretary-General to \r\ncombat sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations \r\noperations. It is essential that we promote a zero-\r\ntolerance culture in that area.\r\n     There are no short cuts or quick fixes for the major \r\nchallenges of our time, such as the crises directly \r\naffecting countries such as  Spain, in particular the \r\nrefugee and migration crises. Humankind cannot \r\nsimply accept as inevitable the fact that 68 million \r\npeople have been forcibly displaced around the world, \r\nof whom more than 25 million are refugees, and over \r\n3 million are asylum-seekers.\r\n    At this session, the General Assembly will adopt the \r\nglobal compact on refugees. That is a great leap forward. \r\nWe must work closely with the High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees and acknowledge the situation that the \r\nrefugee turmoil causes in host countries. We should \r\nespecially bear in mind that 85 per cent of the world’s \r\nrefugees and asylum-seekers are concentrated in \r\ndeveloping countries. Those States need our empathy \r\nand commitment, and, above all else, justice and an \r\nequitable distribution of that responsibility in which we \r\nall have the obligation to help. Spain has suffered the \r\ncalamities of the economic crisis more than almost any \r\nother Western European country. Nonetheless, the vast \r\nmajority of Spanish society has never turned its back on \r\nthe tragic situation of migrants.\r\n     In that connection, I am proud of our society, which \r\nhas not been drawn into the radical fever of xenophobic \r\ndiscourse based on a culture of fear of the other. Perhaps \r\nthat is because we remember our own country’s history. \r\nWe were a country of migrants and refugees as well. \r\nAnd that is why we will not abandon our international \r\ncommitments. If we take in a boat that is adrift in the \r\nMediterranean with 630 people on board, it is not only \r\nbecause international law demands it, but also because \r\nit is a moral imperative.\r\n    Spain welcomes the coming global compact for \r\nsafe, orderly and regular migration, which is set to be \r\nadopted in Marrakech in December. When migration \r\nis safe, orderly and regular, it is possible to benefit \r\nfrom its positive impact. Rather than accepting an \r\nimage of countries as fortresses, with exclusionary \r\nand xenophobic narratives, the Government of Spain \r\nchampions the concepts of solidarity, humanity \r\nand respect.\r\n     Spain is well aware of what that challenge entails. \r\nWe are ultimately a country of origin, transit, \r\ndestination and return. We defend a migration policy \r\nwhose fundamental goal is to address the root causes of \r\nmigration, such as poverty, environmental degradation \r\nor a lack of opportunities for many young people in the \r\nworld. Ultimately, we must aspire for migration to be a \r\nfree choice and not a necessity. Such a policy requires \r\ndialogue and cooperation with the countries of origin \r\nand transit, especially with the African countries, \r\nand we are working with the European Union and in \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 33/61\r\nthe Government to devote significant resources to \r\nthat issue.\r\n     There are many forms of poverty. Allow me to \r\nunderscore the abomination of childhood poverty and \r\nthe poverty that aff licts women. More than 15 million \r\ngirls will never have the chance to learn to read or write \r\nin primary school, and 330 million women are living \r\non less than $2 a day. To fight that and other forms of \r\npoverty, I would like to mention the need for a global \r\nperspective and a new twenty-first-century humanism \r\nbased on the values that have brought the greatest \r\nprosperity ever known to humankind.\r\n     The 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) are the current embodiment of that spirit, \r\nin which humankind and the planet occupy a central \r\nplace. We must adopt the Agenda as a new global social \r\ncontract, binding us all and connecting us with future \r\ngenerations. Spain is going to work with determination \r\nto make that change. We have approved an action plan for \r\nimplementing the 2030 Agenda, and we will launch our \r\nown national sustainable development strategy. Indeed, \r\nmany of the measures adopted by my Government \r\nare directly tied to our commitment to meeting \r\nthe objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, namely, combating gender violence, \r\ntaking measures against child poverty and against \r\nenergy poverty, regaining universality throughout our \r\ncountry’s health-care system, setting policies for grants \r\nto advance equal opportunities among young people, \r\nand improving workers’ rights. Such actions, in short, \r\nfully embrace and are aligned with the 2030 Agenda.\r\nSpain is therefore moving forward along the \r\npath carved out by the United Nations in the 2030 \r\nAgenda. Spain has done that before, in fact, when we \r\nchampioned the Millennium Development Goals, with \r\nthe largest contribution from any single donor in the \r\nUnited Nations system, as well as being the first to the \r\nSustainable Development Goals project. Furthermore, \r\nSpain also created the Water and Sanitation Cooperation \r\nFund in Latin America and the Caribbean some years \r\nago, in which we have invested more than €800 million.\r\nHowever, none of those efforts make any sense \r\nunless we tackle the greatest threat of our generation: \r\nthe impact of climate change. I come from a country \r\nwhere 40 per cent of our surface area is threatened by \r\ndesertification. We must fight that battle at every level, \r\nwhich means not only addressing its most immediate \r\neffects but also addressing theunderlying structural \r\ncauses that exacerbate the changes in our climate that \r\nwe are witnessing. This is why we are keenly aware of \r\nthe need to undertake a controlled decarbonization of \r\nour economy.\r\nYesterday, I announced that Spain would join \r\nthe Carbon Neutrality Coalition, deepening our \r\ncommitment to implementing ambitious long-\r\nterm strategies for reducing carbon dioxide and \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions. That will enable us to fully \r\ncomply with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \r\nWe urgently need to make a just ecological transition, \r\nlaying the foundations for a new production model to \r\nwhich the Spanish Government is fully committed. \r\nOur future depends on renewable energy and clean \r\ntechnologies. Only from that starting point will we be \r\nable to combine material well-being with social justice \r\nand environmental sustainability.\r\nI also wish to share the fact that Spain will \r\nparticipate constructively in the twenty-fourth session \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, which will \r\ntake place in Poland this year, and the climate change \r\nsummit to be convened by the Secretary-General in \r\n2019. We hope that those meetings will be successful, \r\nand Spain will of course contribute constructively and \r\nactively to their smooth execution. Ultimately, it is \r\nnecessary for us to be able to move forward and comply \r\nwith the Paris Agreement — we believe that those \r\nmeetings offer the occasion to advance and achieve \r\nour objectives.\r\nIt is also up to us to make progress in terms of \r\nsecurity, but it must be a security focused on human \r\nbeings. It has taken us a long time, in my opinion, to \r\nlearn that security is much more than a concept tied \r\nto defence, in the military sense of the term. Security \r\nfinds its raison d’être not in the absence of conflict, but \r\nin guaranteeing freedom.\r\nTerrorism continues to be one of the major threats \r\nto our freedom. That phenomenon was not born out of \r\na supposed clash of civilizations, as some have claimed \r\nfor decades. There are a few areas in which cooperation, \r\nalong with the multilateralism demonstrated here at \r\nthe General Assembly and collaborative, cooperative \r\nleadership — to which the Secretary-General alluded \r\nin his remarks — can bear such abundant and beneficial \r\nfruit. The fight against terrorist financing networks \r\nis crucial, as are international police and judiciary \r\ncooperation and the exchange of information and \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n34/61 18-30073\r\nintelligence. I am sure that we would all agree that \r\nthose aspects are fundamental.\r\nHowever, it is also essential to combat the hatred \r\nand violence that are being echoed in so many forums. \r\nWe must do all we can to prevent our young people from \r\nfalling prey to fanaticism and radical, exclusionary \r\ndiscourse. Governments, businesses and civil society \r\nmust strengthen social and economic integration with \r\na view to keeping recruitment networks from taking \r\nover that space. It is here, in that space devoid of \r\nexpectations for personal development, where we must \r\nwin the battle against terrorism. Likewise, we must \r\nbe able to overcome the slightest hint of division and \r\nresentment, while crafting a narrative of solidarity and \r\nremembrance that includes the voices of the victims of \r\nterrorism and strengthens the cohesion of our societies.\r\nInvesting in education and in our young people; \r\ntaking an appropriate and comprehensive view of \r\nmigratory issues, providing the media with tools \r\nto combat hate speech — which are ever-present in \r\nglobal public discussions — and fighting stereotypes \r\nare undoubtedly essential areas of action. Those are \r\nprecisely the areas that fall under the remit of the \r\nUnited Nations Alliance of Civilizations, an instrument \r\nfor dialogue among cultures and religions, which is \r\nsupported by the Government of Spain.\r\nThe growing tensions regarding nuclear \r\nproliferation and weapons of mass destruction are \r\nequally troubling. The world cannot afford another \r\narms race. We must make the effort to regain the \r\nconsensus that has been lost and strengthen the \r\nnon-proliferation regime. Spain can, of course, be \r\ncounted upon to participate and commit. The spread of \r\narmed conflicts and their changing nature — which is \r\nincreasingly hybrid and complex — also demand our \r\nattention. Spain is firmly committed to strengthening \r\nthe role of the United Nations in maintaining peace and \r\ninternational security.\r\nWe therefore support the measures promoted \r\nby the Secretary-General to place prevention and \r\npeacebuilding at the centre of the work of the United \r\nNations. We also support his efforts to reform the \r\narchitecture and management of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations, to which Spain has been a \r\nmost active contributor for decades. Over the years, \r\nmore than 160,000 Spanish troops have served in United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations, demonstrating \r\nloyalty and commitment and enjoying the confidence \r\nand support of many of the peoples they serve beyond \r\nour borders. Consequently, Spain supports the \r\nSecretary-General’s Action for Peacekeeping and the \r\nDeclaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations \r\nPeacekeeping Operations.\r\nNevertheless, conflict prevention and maintaining \r\nand consolidating peace are not enough; wherever a \r\nconflict breaks out, we must act. Spain supports respect \r\nfor and enforcement of international humanitarian law, \r\nso that no violation goes unpunished. I call upon the \r\njustice system to pursue and prosecute those who commit \r\nwar crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. In \r\nthat connection the efforts of the International Criminal \r\nCourt are, in our view, irreplaceable.\r\nI call also on the leaders of States and of the \r\ninternational community to protect their civilian \r\npopulations. I believe it is important to underscore that \r\npoint before the Assembly. Spain strongly supports the \r\nFranco-Mexican initiative to limit the use of the veto \r\npower in cases of mass atrocity. Humanitarian disasters \r\nsuch as those in Syria and Iraq remind us of the high \r\nprice of failing to act in time.\r\nIn order for the multilateral system to be effective, \r\nwe must renovate and reinforce it — a recurring theme \r\nat the heart of the Assembly. In so doing, we will be \r\ndefending everything that we believe in, namely, \r\nmultilateralism. Spain therefore strongly supports the \r\nreform of the United Nations system promoted by the \r\nSecretary-General. We have before us the challenge \r\nof clearly integrating the pillars of peace, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and human rights and avoiding the \r\nduplications and overlapping that only drag this \r\ninstitution down.\r\nWe must win back vital public opinion — something \r\nI would like to reflect upon here — and the favour of a \r\nglobal citizenry that has come of age in an atmosphere \r\nof growing scepticism about an Organization than \r\ncan no longer rest on its many past achievements, \r\ndespite the fact that they are significant and worthy of \r\nremembrance. We must now use our ambition in the \r\ntask of winning over new generations. Our sole source \r\nof strength lies in the capacity of the United Nations to \r\nproject that message to the world. I believe, therefore, \r\nthat it is fundamental that we serve as role models to \r\nbe worthy of the example set by those who represent \r\nthe very best of the United Nations — the staff who \r\nrisk their lives in conflict zones. I express my sincerest \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 35/61\r\nrecognition to all those men and women who work \r\nbravely on the ground every day.\r\nThe challenge of the disrepute into which politics \r\nhas fallen is also at stake in the multilateral arena. We \r\nmust win the battle against those who would spread the \r\nshadow of uncertainty and have a single goal, namely, \r\nto cast doubt on the role of international organizations \r\nsuch as the United Nations. Spain is a solid ally in \r\nthat task.\r\nThere are two issues that I would like, within the \r\ncontext of the United Nations, to call the Assembly’s \r\nattention to before concluding.\r\nFirst is the question of Gibraltar, on which \r\nSpain’s position is well known — including by \r\nthe Assembly — and aligned with United Nations \r\ndoctrine. The United Kingdom’s decision to leave the \r\nEuropean Union means that Gibraltar will also leave \r\nthe Union. I would like for the Spanish Government \r\nto take advantage of this historic occasion to establish \r\na new relationship between the United Kingdom and \r\nthe European Union — which will inevitably involve \r\nSpain — to bring prosperity to and benefit the entire \r\nregion. This includes Gibraltarians, as well as those in \r\nthe wider area of Campo de Gibraltar.\r\nWe are also concerned, of course, by the persistent \r\ncrisis in the Western Sahara. Spain defends the central \r\nrole of the United Nations and would like to contribute \r\nto the efforts of the Secretary-General and his \r\nSpecial Envoy to achieve a just, lasting and mutually \r\nacceptable political solution that will provide for the \r\nself-determination of the people of the Western Sahara. \r\nThis should be done in the context of arrangements \r\nconsistent with the principles and purposes of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nSpain is a fully f ledged democracy and, this year, \r\ncelebrates the fortieth anniversary of our Constitution, \r\nwhich brought democracy to our country. It also ranks \r\nhigh on global indexes that measure the democratic \r\nquality of our countries’ institutions. Moreover, \r\nSpain has made its defence of and commitment to \r\nmultilateralism a hallmark of our identity, a f lag we \r\nwave with fervour and conviction whenever we go \r\nbeyond our borders.\r\nToday, the world faces major threats, just as it \r\ndid eight decades ago — something that has been \r\nremarked upon by many speakers. Cooperative \r\nleadership, to which Spain subscribes, demands a \r\nrenewed commitment to multilateralism. Solutions to \r\nglobal problems can be found only through cooperation \r\nbetween States — that is the firm belief of the Spanish \r\nGovernment and of Spanish society as a whole. Let us \r\nensure that the coming decade represents a victory for \r\nconsensus and a defeat for those who seek only to hear \r\nthe echoes of their own voices.\r\nI address the Assembly today in New York, a city \r\nthat saw the arrival of millions of human beings f leeing \r\nfrom poverty and from political, racial and religious \r\npersecution. The immense majority of them were \r\nEuropeans. Today, on both shores of the North Atlantic, \r\na collective veil of amnesia is being drawn over the \r\nmemory of what we were and of what we are, namely, \r\nsheer diversity.\r\nAs the great exiled Spanish poet León Felipe wrote: \r\n“It is not a matter of getting there first on your own, \r\nbut of arriving together, on time”. Nothing defines the \r\ngoals of the United Nations better than the vitality of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda. It represents this decade’s horizon of \r\nhope — one that we must strive towards in order to \r\narrive, as the poet said, together and on time, leaving \r\nno one behind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Government of the Kingdom of Spain \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón, President \r\nof the Government of the Kingdom of Spain, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Ms. Ana Brnabić, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Serbia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Serbia.\r\nMs. Ana Brnabić, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Ms. Ana \r\nBrnabić, Prime Minister of the Republic of Serbia, and \r\ninviting her to address the Assembly.\r\nMs. Brnabić (Serbia): First of all, it is indeed a great \r\nhonour for me to address the Assembly on behalf of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia. I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate Her Excellency Ms. Maria Fernanda \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n36/61 18-30073\r\nEspinosa Garcés on the assumption of the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I wish \r\nto assure the President that Serbia is deeply committed \r\nto advancing, in practice, the topics on this session’s \r\nagenda, namely, peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties. Having said that, I must also say that it is \r\nindeed a pleasure to see that a fellow stateswoman is \r\npresiding over this important institution.\r\nMy congratulations are also due to His Excellency \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák for his stewardship of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session, as well as \r\nto His Excellency Mr. António Guterres, Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for his engagement and commitment to \r\npromoting important reform processes within the \r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nI would not be saying anything new or original if \r\nI were to say that the world of today — be it Europe, \r\nthe Americas, Asia, Africa or Australia — faces \r\nsignificant and increasing challenges. We are already \r\nfeeling the grave consequences of climate change, \r\nmigration and terrorism, the rise of populism and the \r\ndivisions between us at a time when we need greater \r\nconvergence. We have all heard that throughout our \r\ndiscussions and from more than one leader during the \r\nGeneral Assembly debate.\r\nI will, however, say this. In looking for our way out \r\nof this troubled situation and in striving to build a better \r\nworld for all of us, we all need to start with ourselves \r\nand the things we must do ourselves, first and foremost \r\nas individuals, then in our countries, in our regions, in \r\nour continents and then in the united world that we are. \r\nWe must once again start bringing the nations of the \r\nworld together, as we did 70 or so years ago.\r\nSerbia is on the way to rethinking itself as a \r\nprosperous, dynamic, creative, innovative, open society \r\nwithin a united Europe that is whole, free and at peace. \r\nI am often asked — when others are leaving European \r\nUnion (EU), when so many express doubts regarding \r\nthe prospect of a united Europe — why would joining \r\nthe EU be the principal strategic goal?\r\nI have often asked myself the same thing. In life, \r\nI believe that when we are not sure of the answer, we \r\nmust go back to basics, clear our heads of the daily \r\nclutter, forget political misconceptions and spins, and \r\nthink of basic values. That, I believe, is where we find \r\nour answers. The basic value of the European Union, \r\nmuch like the basic value of the United Nations, is \r\npeace. It is not the economy, nor trade, nor a bigger \r\nmarket. It is peace. All of the other things and much, \r\nmuch more came, and will always come, as a spill-over \r\neffect of peace.\r\nThe European Union was a peace project, and it is \r\na successful one. We want and we need to be part of \r\nit, so that there is sustainable peace and, consequently, \r\nstability and prosperity in the Balkans — that troubled \r\nregion of the world that used to be known as the “powder \r\nkeg” of Europe.\r\nI am extremely proud of what Serbia has been \r\nable to achieve in the past four years. We have built \r\nmacroeconomic stability and proved ourselves to be a \r\nresponsible and reliable partner. Our economic activity \r\nhas intensified, unemployment has more than halved \r\ncompared to just four years ago, and we are seeing \r\nspeedy recovery. Today, Serbia is one of the countries \r\nexperiencing the highest economic growth in Europe, \r\ncharacterized by a substantial and ever-greater influx \r\nof foreign investment.\r\nWe have embarked on a comprehensive public \r\nadministration reform with one simple goal: greater \r\nfocus on citizens. We remind our Administration — all \r\nof us — on a daily basis that we are there to serve, not \r\nto be served. We are also working on strengthening the \r\nrule of law through judicial reforms, working with the \r\nmedia, establishing honest dialogue with civil-society \r\norganizations, building institutions to fight organized \r\ncrime and corruption and ensuring fairness and justice \r\nfor all. What we are doing is not easy, and I must say \r\nthat we are far from always being successful, but it is a \r\npath to which we are fully committed.\r\nWhen talking about things that are not easy to deal \r\nwith, but for which one needs to take responsibility in \r\norder to build peace and prosperity in one’s region, one’s \r\ncontinent and one’s world, I cannot emphasize enough \r\nhow important regional cooperation and stability is \r\nfor Serbia. Here, we are talking about a region which \r\nhas never, ever been stable or very predictable. Nor \r\nis it a part of the world known for peace, reason and \r\npragmatism — on the contrary. We have always been \r\nknown for — but have always been proud of — our \r\nexcessive emotions, sacrifices, poetic struggles and \r\ntraditional animosities.\r\nMr. Allen (United Kingdom), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nToday, Serbia is trying very hard to leave that behind \r\nand grow and become more reasonable, instead of more \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 37/61\r\nemotional; more pragmatic, instead of immersed in \r\nmyths, a country that is proud of its victories, not of \r\nits losses, and a country that is building unexpected \r\nfriendships in place of traditional animosities. I am \r\nproud to say that our President led the way in this \r\ninternal struggle of ours to grow and mature, to leave \r\nthe past behind and turn towards a very different future.\r\nFirst and foremost, I will address here the issue \r\nof our Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, \r\nwhich split even the United Nations down the middle. \r\nFewer than half of States Members of the United \r\nNations have recognized the unilateral declaration of \r\nindependence of Kosovo, while more than half — that \r\nis, more than 5 billion people across the world — refuse \r\nto recognize the illegal secession of Kosovo.\r\nWhat Serbia has been trying to do in the past year \r\nis essentially to close Pandora’s box, not reopen it, \r\nfollowing the events of 10 years ago when the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence was proclaimed by the \r\nauthorities in Pristina. A number of countries in the \r\nworld rushed to recognize that unilateral declaration \r\nof independence, regardless of international law and \r\nstandards, regardless of the fact that the declaration \r\nwas issued only four years after Serbian churches and \r\nmonasteries — I remind the Assembly that these are \r\nWorld Heritage sites — were looted and burned, and \r\nregardless of the fact that the international community \r\nhas always stated “standards before status” as their \r\nmantra. When everyone saw that standards were not \r\non Pristina’s agenda, they decided to break their own \r\nmantra and simply decide on its status.\r\nToday’s Serbia is committed to peace and, if I \r\nmay say so, to behaving like an adult. We signed the \r\nBrussels Agreement more than five years ago and we \r\nhave implemented it. Pristina signed it but, even five \r\nyears on, has still not implemented a single word. We \r\nwill continue insisting on the full implementation of \r\nthe Brussels Agreement and the establishment of the \r\nCommunity of Serbian Municipalities, but we will \r\nremain tolerant and patient.\r\nHowever difficult, challenging and sometimes \r\nhopeless and wasteful the dialogue with Pristina might \r\nbe, we will stay committed to finding a compromise that \r\nwill ensure sustainable peace, prosperity and a brighter \r\nfuture for all people in the region. Serbia will continue \r\ndemonstrating its readiness to compromise, which is far \r\nfrom easy in that we need a counterpart that is politically \r\nbold, responsible, committed and trustworthy. That \r\nhas not been the case so far. I am therefore asking the \r\ninternational community to continue supporting the \r\nefforts that Serbia has initiated. To achieve progress \r\nin the dialogue, we need the undiluted and consistent \r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nSerbia is committed to working with other nations \r\nacross the globe to take our common destiny, as many \r\nat the United Nations refer to it, into our own hands. \r\nWe want to claim our accountability towards future \r\ngenerations. We want them to hold us accountable. That \r\nis why we are investing so much in peace, understanding \r\nand reconciliation in the region. On the other hand, we \r\nare equally investing in the future. The key priorities of \r\nmy Government are youth and education. We need to \r\nstart teaching our youth how to think, not what to think.\r\nAll of us, not just Serbia, need to start investing \r\nmore than ever before in education to create more \r\ninnovative, braver, freer-thinking individuals who \r\nwill then, in turn, create a world that is freer, fairer, \r\nand — to be honest — much more fun. The world \r\nwill value people for who they are and for the values \r\nand beliefs they stand for, rather than for where they \r\nare from, the colour of their skin or whom they love. \r\nSerbia is very fortunate because we have a lot of \r\npeople — especially young people — who are amongst \r\nthe best in the world at creative thinking, video-\r\ngame design, genome research, digital agriculture, \r\nanimation, physics, machine engineering, mathematics, \r\nblockchain, artificial intelligence, big-data analytics, \r\nbiology, software development and programming.\r\nOur absolutely key priority is to support them and \r\nto make sure that we create a system and institutions \r\nable to ensure that more of them can realize their full \r\npotential. Not only will that be the basis for the future \r\ngrowth of Serbia, but, perhaps more importantly, we \r\nhope to be able to empower them so that they will, \r\ntogether with others from all over the world, build a \r\nbetter world for all of us. Without any doubt, our future \r\nis digital. As Secretary-General Guterres said at the \r\nopening of the general debate, “technology is our ally” \r\n(A/73/PV.6, p. 3).\r\nI believe that Serbia, although small, can and \r\nwill play an important role in digital development in \r\nthe future. That will help us deal with climate change, \r\nby far the biggest challenge ahead of us. We must also \r\nalleviate hunger by increasing efficiency and by making \r\nagriculture smarter, and reduce poverty by ensuring \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n38/61 18-30073\r\neasy access to finance, even for the poorest and most \r\ndisadvantaged — those whom we cannot leave behind.\r\nThis is how Serbia sees its path towards more \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies in our \r\nworld. This is us — Serbia —doing our bit for a \r\nbetter world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Ana Brnabić, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ruhakana Rugunda, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Uganda\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Uganda.\r\nMr. Ruhakana Rugunda, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Ruhakana Rugunda, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Uganda, and inviting \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Rugunda (Uganda): I congratulate Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-third session \r\nand assure her of Uganda’s full support. We are \r\nconfident that she will lead the Assembly effectively \r\nand successfully. I would also like to express our \r\ngratitude to Mr. Miroslav Lajčák for his leadership \r\nat the seventy-second session. I also pay tribute to \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, for his \r\npersonal dedication and commitment to the work of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe theme for the seventy-third session — “Making \r\nthe United Nations relevant to all people: global \r\nleadership and shared responsibility for peaceful, \r\nequitable and sustainable societies” — is very pertinent. \r\nThree years ago, in this Hall, we adopted the universal \r\nand transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), to guide our efforts over \r\nthe next 15 years. At the heart of the 2030 Agenda was \r\na pledge to leave no one behind. That meant that the \r\n17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their \r\ntargets should be met for everyone, with a particular \r\nfocus on the poorest, most vulnerable and furthest \r\nbehind — people who are indeed often left out.\r\nWe in Uganda have devoted a reasonable amount \r\nof time and resources to follow through on the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda and establish \r\nlinks between the SDGs and our national priorities. \r\nWe are working deliberately to ensure that the SDGs \r\nare implemented in an effective and timely manner for \r\nthe socioeconomic transformation and improvement of \r\nour people’s livelihoods. To do so, we have integrated \r\n76 per cent of the SDGs into our national development \r\nplan for the period 2015-2020, as part of the Uganda \r\nVision 2040.\r\nFrom our engagements so far, it is evident that the \r\nbiggest challenge remains the obtaining of adequate \r\nfinancing to implement the 2030 Agenda — an issue \r\nthat arose clearly in the high-level political forum held \r\nin New York in June. We in Uganda are doing our best \r\nto mobilize resources, both domestic and external, to \r\nimplement the SDGs. We are committed to leveraging \r\nsupport into productive areas, including the private \r\nsector, which has the potential to boost our economy \r\nand thereby contribute additional internally-generated \r\nresources to help implement the SDGs. We call upon \r\ndevelopment partners to fulfil their commitments and \r\nextend their support in terms of timely and adequate \r\nmeans for the implementation of the SDGs, as well as \r\nto prioritize the special needs of the most vulnerable \r\ncountries and strengthen partnerships with them.\r\nOur development and transformation cannot take \r\nplace without peace and security, which are prerequisites \r\nfor socioeconomic transformation. We should devote \r\nour attention to supporting an environment that is \r\npeaceful, thereby enabling us to concentrate on growth \r\nand development. Today, challenges transcend borders, \r\nand no country alone can carry the weight of the world \r\non its shoulders. We must redouble our collective efforts \r\nto seek common solutions to pressing regional and \r\nglobal challenges, including conflicts in various parts \r\nof the world, transnational organized crime, terrorism \r\nand violent extremism.\r\nWe must be unwavering in our resolve to combat \r\nterrorism, religious extremism and terrorism from \r\ngroups such as  Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant and Al-Qaida, \r\nwhich constitute threats to our common security and \r\ndevelopment. That threat is compounded today, given \r\nthe possibility of linkages between terrorism and the \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 39/61\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Those \r\nchallenges cut across national boundaries and require \r\ncollective responses.\r\nUganda remains committed to multilateralism as \r\na means of achieving comprehensive and equitable \r\nsolutions to global problems and challenges. In order \r\nto respond successfully to global crises, threats and \r\nchallenges, the international community needs an \r\nefficient multilateral system. It is for that reason that \r\nUganda has continued to advance the cause for a \r\nrevitalized, reformed and effective United Nations \r\nsystem. That is critical if we are to make the United \r\nNations more responsive, more efficient and more \r\neffective in its support for Member States’ efforts to \r\nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nUganda supports the comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, and our approach is consistent with the \r\nAfrican continent’s common position, as enunciated in \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus. First, African issues dominate \r\nthe Security Council agenda, and therefore the vast \r\nmajority of decisions made by the Security Council \r\naffect African countries. Secondly, over the past few \r\nyears, Africa has shown its commitment to conflict \r\nprevention, mediation and resolution, as demonstrated \r\nby its leadership and response to conflict situations that \r\nhave developed in the continent over the past few years.\r\nWe believe that for a continent with 54 countries, \r\na population of more than 1 billion people and \r\ndemonstrable political commitment, Africa should \r\nhave a greater voice in the global political debate, \r\nwhich would increase the legitimacy of the decisions \r\nof the Security Council and foster its effectiveness. \r\nIt is essential that the Council membership, in both \r\nthe permanent and the non-permanent categories, be \r\nequitable and reflect today’s geopolitical realities. We \r\ntherefore support the efforts of Member States to move \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations process on Security \r\nCouncil reform forward, and we call for a constructive \r\nspirit aimed at realizing the long-awaited reform.\r\nStrengthening South-South cooperation is critical \r\nto the achievement of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. Over the 40 years of its existence, South-\r\nSouth cooperation has proved to be a valuable avenue \r\nfor building capacity and promoting development in \r\ndeveloping countries. It has also facilitated cooperation, \r\nas manifested in South-South and triangular \r\ncooperation. It is our desire that we expand the scope \r\nof South-South cooperation to include, among other \r\nelements, trade, investment, infrastructure, tourism, \r\npeacebuilding and other areas of mutual interest. \r\nWe look forward to the forthcoming United Nations \r\nministerial conference on South-South cooperation, \r\nwhich is to be held in Buenos Aires and which, we hope, \r\nwill devote time to considering how to strengthen and \r\nfurther revitalize such cooperation within the context \r\nof a Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.\r\nThe United Nations has the primary responsibility \r\nfor international peace and security. However, \r\nin undertaking that role, it is essential that the \r\nOrganization support initiatives undertaken by regional \r\nand subregional organizations. That partnership should \r\nbe based on the division of labour, burden-sharing and \r\ncomplementarity, as well as mutual respect.\r\nIn Africa, the evidence is that, where such \r\ncooperation has taken place, the results have been \r\npositive. One example is the cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the African Union on the situation \r\nin Somalia, where the African Union Mission in \r\nSomalia (AMISOM) has supported the efforts of the \r\nSomali Government to stabilize the country. Uganda \r\nhas played an active role in those regional initiatives. \r\nSince AMISOM’s deployment 11 years ago, we have \r\nwitnessed tremendous progress in Somalia.\r\nThe Somali Government, previously based outside \r\nthe country, has been based in Mogadishu since 2007. \r\nInternational organizations, including the United \r\nNations and diplomatic missions, have also relocated \r\nto Mogadishu. More than 80 per cent of the areas \r\ndominated by Al-Shabaab have been liberated. The \r\narea of piracy and the threat that piracy had caused at \r\nsea, threatening international shipping and trade, has \r\nbeen neutralized. Business is thriving, and there are \r\nnumerous reconstruction activities in many parts of \r\nthe country. Incidentally, regular elections have also \r\nbeen held.\r\nThose positive developments and Somalia’s relative \r\nstability would hardly have been possible without the \r\ncontribution and sacrifice of AMISOM and the Somali \r\nsecurity forces. Uganda appreciates the support that \r\nthe African Union and international partners have \r\ngiven to AMISOM, which was never intended to be in \r\nSomalia forever. That is why it is essential that Somalia \r\nbe supported in providing security for its people. It is \r\ncrucial that any reduction in the number of AMISOM \r\ntroops correspond with the strengthening of the Somali \r\nsecurity forces. The failure to carefully manage that \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n40/61 18-30073\r\nprocess could imperil the political and security gains \r\nalready made in Somalia.\r\nOn South Sudan, Uganda has actively participated \r\nin the peace process launched in June 2017 and led \r\nby Intergovernmental Authority on Development. We \r\nwelcome the recently signed and revitalized Agreement \r\non the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan. The Agreement outlines guidelines on \r\npower sharing, governance and security arrangements, \r\nincluding the settling of boundary disputes, which will \r\nbe guided by a boundary commission. We call on the \r\ninternational community to support the implementation \r\nof the Agreement.\r\nClimate change remains a major challenge \r\nand a threat to our efforts to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Uganda supported the efforts to reach the \r\nnew, universally binding Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, reached in December 2015. Uganda was one \r\nof the first countries to sign and ratify the Agreement \r\nlast year. We must continue to muster the political will \r\nnecessary to fully implement the Agreement. There is \r\na need for the enhanced delivery of finance to the most \r\nvulnerable countries to support their climate-change \r\nmitigation and adaptation measures.\r\nAs highlighted in the 2030 Agenda, we can be the \r\nfirst generation to succeed in ending poverty, just as we \r\nmay be the last generation to have a chance of saving \r\nthe planet. Let all of us commit ourselves to preventing \r\nwars and to promoting peace. Let us build new \r\ninternational relations. Let us reduce inequalities. Let \r\nus ensure that no one is left behind. And let us support \r\nthe primary role of the United Nations as the principal \r\norganization for addressing global challenges.\r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda coincided with \r\nthe onset of what would become Uganda’s single largest \r\nrefugee influx in its history. As a country, we now \r\nhost 1.4 million refugees, which is the largest number \r\non the African continent and ranks quite high at the \r\nglobal level.\r\nThe presence of large numbers of refugees, \r\nmostly arriving unexpectedly and quickly, amplifies \r\nthe existing vulnerability of host communities. It \r\nalso places a huge demand on already over-stretched \r\nnational capacities and resources.\r\nUganda remains committed to maintaining and \r\npromoting asylum space and its refugee model, \r\nconsistent with the 2016 New York Declaration for \r\nRefugees and Migrants. We do that because we know \r\nthat no one chooses to be a refugee. We also understand \r\nthe critical importance of treating refugees humanely, \r\ndecently and with dignity. We remain committed to \r\nworking with national, regional and international actors \r\nto address the drivers of displacement and refugees. \r\nWe are grateful for the solidarity and support that the \r\ninternational community has extended to Uganda thus \r\nfar. It is our expectation that the new global compact on \r\nrefugees will provide the much needed predictable and \r\nequitable burden- and responsibility-sharing among all \r\nMember States.\r\nLastly, Uganda remains ready to work with the \r\nSecretary-General and all Member States to realize \r\na United Nations that is more inclusive, effective and \r\nresponsive to the needs of the peoples of the world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ruhakana Rugunda, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Lyonpo Tshering Wangchuk, \r\nChief Adviser of the Interim Government and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom \r\nof Bhutan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Chief Adviser of the Interim \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of Bhutan.\r\nMr. Lyonpo Tshering Wangchuk, Chief Adviser of \r\nthe Interim Government and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of Bhutan, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Lyonpo Tshering \r\nWangchuk, Chief Adviser and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Interim Government of the Kingdom of \r\nBhutan, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Wangchuk (Bhutan): I have the honour to \r\nconvey the greetings of His Majesty the King of \r\nBhutan to the General Assembly and his best wishes \r\nfor the success of the seventy-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI also wish to congratulate Her Excellency \r\nMrs. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her being \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 41/61\r\nelected president of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session and to assure her of Bhutan’s full support. \r\nThe Kingdom of Bhutan also commends His Excellency \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák for the successful completion of \r\nthe seventy-second session of the General Assembly.\r\nI seek the Assembly’s indulgence in allowing me \r\nto share Bhutan’s observations on some of the key \r\nissues before us today. Bhutan welcomes and supports \r\nthe ambitious and timely agenda of Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres to reform the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system in order to ensure that it is in sync \r\nwith the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand make the United Nations more relevant and fit for \r\npurpose. We also welcome the draft implementation \r\nplan of the Deputy Secretary-General for the inception \r\nof the new Resident Coordinator system. We have taken \r\nnote of the appeal to Member States for a front-loaded \r\nvoluntary contribution to the special trust fund to \r\ncover the immediate gap of the cost of a reinvigorated \r\nresident coordinator system. In that regard, Bhutan \r\nwill be making a token voluntary contribution to the \r\ntrust fund.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council must go hand \r\nin hand with the wider reforms of the United Nations \r\nsystem. It must accommodate the interests and \r\nconcerns of all Member States, particularly of those \r\nthat are underrepresented, with a view to reflecting \r\nthe realities of a vastly changed global environment. \r\nThe membership of the United Nations has increased \r\nfourfold over the years, and the challenges we face \r\ntoday have become far more complex. The institution \r\nmust therefore adapt, evolve and ensure its relevance \r\nand ability to address the growing challenges of our \r\ntimes and fulfil our common aspirations for a more \r\nequitable, inclusive and sustainable world.\r\nThe reforms of the United Nations that are geared \r\ntowards implementing the 2030 Agenda must provide \r\nthe essential impetus needed to galvanize support for \r\nprogress in areas that have been found to be deficient \r\nso that we can meet the goals and targets within the \r\ntime frame set — that is, by 2030. I am happy to share \r\nwith the Assembly that Bhutan is well on track towards \r\nsuccess in implementing the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs). With the happiness and well-being of \r\nour people at the centre of our development efforts, \r\nBhutan’s development model of gross national happiness \r\nresonates well with the objectives of the 2030 Agenda. \r\nThe repositioning of sustainable development, which is \r\nat the heart of the United Nations principle of leaving \r\nno one behind, is also in tandem with Bhutan’s national \r\ndevelopment priorities.\r\nBhutan presented its voluntary national review on \r\nthe implementation of the SDG targets at the High-\r\nlevel Political Forum in New York in July this year. The \r\nreview enabled us to assess the progress made in our \r\nendeavours towards the implementation of the targets \r\nand achievements. I thank Member States for their keen \r\ninterest and valuable feedback.\r\nBhutan, a tiny landlocked country in the Himalayas, \r\nstarted its planned development only in 1961. Under \r\nthe visionary leadership of our monarchs, the industry \r\nof our people and the generous assistance from our \r\ndevelopment partners, Bhutan today is poised to graduate \r\nfrom the least developed countries (LDCs) category. \r\nWe successfully completed our second triennial review \r\nof the Committee for Development Policy in March \r\nand have been recommended for graduation in 2023. \r\nOn behalf of the Royal Government, I would like to \r\nexpress our sincere gratitude and appreciation to all our \r\ndevelopment partners for their friendship, generosity \r\nand support over the years.\r\nWhile we have achieved two of the three thresholds \r\nfor eligibility to graduate from the least development \r\ncountry category, we have, for two successive triennials, \r\nnot been able to reach the economic vulnerability \r\nindex threshold. Bhutan continues to face serious \r\nchallenges in terms of its narrow economic base and \r\nvulnerability to natural disasters. The economic and \r\nstructural impediments to growth are also reported \r\nin the vulnerability profile of Bhutan produced by the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\r\nBhutan looks forward to undertaking its graduation \r\nfrom LDC status in a sustainable manner by building \r\nproductive capacity and economic resilience so as to \r\nensure that there is no rolling back of hard-earned \r\ndevelopment gains. The pace of graduation must be \r\nable to absorb the withdrawal of international support \r\nmeasures. A smooth transition is therefore critical \r\nin order to ensure that graduation is sustainable and \r\ndoes not disrupt ongoing development plans and \r\nprocesses. The forthcoming twelfth five-year national \r\ndevelopment plan, the plan for the period 2018 to 2023, \r\nis critical, as it is Bhutan’s final plan as an LDC and \r\nwill serve as our transition strategy for graduation. \r\nEfforts during that period will focus on consolidating \r\npast progress and addressing the remaining last-mile \r\nchallenges, so as to build a strong foundation for a \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n42/61 18-30073\r\nvibrant, resilient and sustainable economy aimed at \r\nachieving the SDGs. The Secretary-General’s 2018 \r\nreport on the progress towards the SDGs (E/2018/64) \r\nunderscored that the LDCs remain far below many of \r\nthe SDG targets. Ultimately, the success of the 2030 \r\nAgenda, with its promise of leaving no one behind, \r\nhinges on the performance achieved by the LDCs.\r\nClimate change resulting from global warming \r\nand human activity is a serious threat not only to \r\nhumankind, but also to sustainable development. \r\nAction is needed at the international, regional, national \r\nand local levels to combat that menace. The impacts \r\nof climate change affect poorer countries and people \r\ndisproportionately, as they are not able to adapt or \r\ndeal with its impacts. Since mitigating climate change \r\nmeans reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, which are \r\ncaused by the consumption of energy in all economic \r\nand household activities, it affects everyone and is \r\ntied to economic and energy-security issues. The ever-\r\nincreasing environmental pressures of climate change, \r\nbiodiversity loss, water scarcity, soil degradation, air \r\nand water pollution, among others, have far-reaching \r\neconomic and social consequences that contribute \r\nto poverty and growing social inequalities. The 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development rightly provides \r\na unique opportunity to ensure that sustainable \r\ndevelopment is based on the rule of law, with a \r\nfocus on the environmental rule of law as central to \r\nsustainable development.\r\nPlanet Earth cannot and must not be the monopoly \r\nof Homo sapiens. It is the abode of all sentient beings. \r\nThe Buddhist tenet associated with the conservation \r\nand protection of the five elements of our planet will \r\nremain as our single hope for survival and refuge \r\nfor posterity. Natural disasters, such as the recent \r\nhurricanes and typhoons that have struck the United \r\nStates, the Philippines, China and Japan and the \r\ndevastating f lood in Kerala, are not isolated incidents. \r\nHow many more like them do we need? How many \r\nmore experts do we need to convince us that natural \r\ndisasters are aggravated by climate change? I believe \r\nthat the devastation and destruction from extreme \r\nweather conditions alone cost the world approximately \r\n$330 billion in 2017. Climate change also threatens \r\nto push 100 million people into extreme poverty by \r\n2030. Climate-change refugees on a large scale will \r\ncertainly become a reality. We must therefore act now \r\nand ensure at all costs that international support to \r\ntackle climate change, mobilized through the landmark \r\nParis Agreement, does not waver. It is the international \r\ncommunity’s moral responsibility to the millions \r\nof people around the world, especially those in the \r\ndeveloping world who are disproportionately affected.\r\nBhutan has also been affected by extreme weather \r\nevents, with increasingly frequent natural disasters such \r\nas glacial-lake outburst f loods, f lash f loods, windstorms \r\nand landslides. They have all had a serious impact on the \r\nassets and livelihood of our people and our hard-earned \r\ndevelopment gains. Bhutan’s leadership in sustainable \r\ndevelopment and environmental stewardship has \r\nbeen recognized globally. We are fortunate that past \r\ninvestments in environmental conservation are reaping \r\nclimate dividends. Our 72.6 per cent forest cover not only \r\nserves as a carbon sink for greenhouse-gas emissions, \r\nit also provides valuable ecosystem services such as \r\nclean water for drinking, agriculture and hydropower \r\ngeneration. Bhutan remains committed to upholding \r\nits 2009 commitment to remaining carbon-neutral and \r\nreaffirms its pledge to fulfil its commitments to the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change.\r\nAlthough Bhutan is a small developing country, \r\nwith a population of little more than half a million, since \r\nbecoming a Member in 1971 we have always worked \r\nconstructively with other Member States to realize the \r\nnoble objectives of the United Nations. Among other \r\nthings, Bhutan remains fully committed to the cause \r\nof international peace and security, one of the key \r\nmandates and objectives of the United Nations. Bhutan \r\njoined the fraternity of troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries in 2014 so as to be able to play a meaningful \r\nrole in maintaining international peace and security, in \r\ntestimony to our commitment to sharing that burden \r\nwith other Member States. Since then, Bhutan has been \r\nworking to gradually broaden and deepen its engagement \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping operations. I am happy \r\nto inform the Assembly that Bhutan became the first \r\ncountry to sign the Rapid Deployment Level agreement \r\nwith the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in \r\nDecember 2017. We have also pledged to provide an \r\nintegrated formed police unit, and we stand ready to \r\ndeploy a contingent whenever the United Nations calls \r\non us to do so.\r\nIn 2008, Bhutan transitioned from a benevolent \r\nabsolute monarchy to a democratic constitutional \r\nmonarchy through a meaningful, deliberate and \r\npurposeful progression. The democratic changes in \r\nBhutan evolved through an internal process, without \r\nexternal pressure or revolution. With the adoption of \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 43/61\r\nthe Constitution in 2008, our monarchs have devolved \r\nthe responsibilities of safeguarding our sovereignty \r\nand security to the Bhutanese people. Since then we \r\nhave witnessed two elected Governments. The second \r\nGovernment’s term ended in August and the third \r\nset of parliamentary elections are now under way. \r\nThe primary round of elections just concluded on \r\n15 September, and the general round will be held on \r\n18 October. We expect to have the next Government in \r\nplace by early November.\r\nIn the past decade, our monarchs and our people \r\nhave established a strong foundation for a functional, \r\nvibrant and intelligent democracy within the tapestry \r\nof constitutionalism and the rule of law. As we look to \r\nthe future, Bhutan will continue working with Member \r\nStates to ensure that the United Nations continues \r\nto play a key role in promoting peace, security and \r\nsolidarity. In that regard, I would like to conclude with \r\na quote from our beloved King, His Majesty Jigme \r\nKhesar Namgyel Wangchuck.\r\n“There cannot be enduring peace, prosperity, \r\nequality and brotherhood in this world if our aims \r\nare so separate and divergent; if we do not accept \r\nthat, in the end, we are people, all alike, sharing the \r\nEarth among ourselves and also with other sentient \r\nbeings, all of whom have an equal role and stake in \r\nthe state of this planet and its players”.\r\nI wish the General Assembly every success at its \r\nseventy-third session.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Chief Adviser of the \r\nInterim Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Kingdom of Bhutan for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Lyonpo Tshering Wangchuk, Chief Adviser of \r\nthe Interim Government and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of Bhutan, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Ismael Ould Cheikh Ahmed, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Cooperation of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Mauritania.\r\nMr. Ahmed (Mauritania) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, it is my pleasure to congratulate Mrs. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés on her assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third \r\nsession and to wish her every success in her work. I \r\nwould also like to express my sincere appreciation to \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák for the remarkable effectiveness \r\nand professionalism with which he led the General \r\nAssembly at its previous session. I would be remiss \r\nif I did not also commend Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres for his great efforts and noble endeavours \r\nto reform and steer our Organization in the service of \r\ninternational peace and security. And I want to offer \r\nmy heartfelt and sincere condolences on the passing of \r\nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was known \r\nfor his honesty, compassion and noble spirit. I had the \r\nhonour to work closely with him on several issues, \r\nparticularly the situation in Syria.\r\nAs we meet today under this one roof, our \r\npeoples look forward to achieving their equitable \r\nand legitimate right to peace, development and a life \r\nof dignity. They are also trying to build a cohesive and \r\nintegrated international system capable of confronting \r\nthe challenges that threaten the existence and survival \r\nof human life, such as hunger, disease, epidemics, \r\nterrorism, wars, poverty, scarce resources, natural \r\ndisasters and a lack of incentives for growth. Mauritania \r\nis confident that the noble values that underpin the \r\nfoundation of this Organization can still build a world \r\nof understanding, peace, and prosperity.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Mauritania, in hosting \r\nthe thirty-first African Union Summit in Nouakchott \r\non 2 and 3 July under the theme “Winning the war \r\non corruption, a sustained course on the path for \r\nthe transformation of Africa”, sought to contribute \r\nto formulating a comprehensive vision aimed at \r\naddressing the challenges posed by corruption, with the \r\ngoal of freeing our African peoples from that heinous \r\nproblem. Mauritania has accomplished much in its fight \r\nagainst corruption, adopting a series of measures and \r\nprocedures aimed at reducing it. We have mobilized \r\nour oversight institutions and adopted transparency \r\nin all financial transactions. We have modernized and \r\ndeveloped our tax-collection system, in addition to \r\nupdating its methods and systems of payment through \r\nthe introduction this year of a fiscal reform programme \r\nthat has led to a change in the base national currency.\r\nUnder the leadership of His Excellency President \r\nMohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, we have adopted an \r\nintegrated economic policy aimed at ensuring the \r\nwelfare and prosperity of our citizens. We have built \r\nroads, airports and seaports, and our Government has \r\nmade basic services available, including drinking water \r\nand electrical power. We have implemented reforms \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n44/61 18-30073\r\ndesigned to speed up growth throughout our economic, \r\nmining and oil sectors. We have also enacted a law \r\nencouraging investments and have established a free \r\neconomic zone in the city of Nouadhibou. We expect \r\nour economic growth to exceed 4 per cent this year.\r\nIn order to mitigate the negative impact of climate \r\nchange on economic growth and life in general, \r\nMauritania has adopted a national policy designed to \r\nutilize renewable sources of energy. We are also working \r\non combating sand invasion and have focused on \r\nenvironmental efforts, including the creation of nature \r\nreserves. Mauritania has ratified all the international \r\nconventions relating to climate change and, as is well \r\nknown, Nouakchott hosts the headquarters of the \r\nAfrican Agency of the Great Green Wall for the Sahara \r\nand the Sahel Initiative.\r\nWe are aware that achieving justice and equity for \r\nall members of society and distributing wealth equitably \r\nconstitute one of the main foundations of a modern \r\nState. Mauritania has therefore enacted fundamental \r\nreforms in its legal system with the aim of entrenching \r\nthe concept of the independence of the judiciary and \r\nmaking it known to litigants. We uphold freedom of the \r\npress as a strategic choice in our efforts to achieve and \r\nenhance democracy. We recently established a public \r\nfund to support the private press and streamline the \r\nelectronic media, and we are working to launch a radio \r\nand television broadcasting service. We have abolished \r\nprison sentences for issues pertaining to press cases \r\nand made public media outlets accessible to all political \r\nactors. All of those achievements have come thanks \r\nto honest political will, aimed at spreading a spirit of \r\nfreedom and democracy, and they have enabled our \r\ncountry to maintain a leading rank in terms of freedom \r\nof the press at the international level. According to \r\nReporters Without Borders, for years Mauritania has \r\nrepeatedly ranked first in the Arab world in terms of \r\nfreedom of the press and of expression, a fact that was \r\nalso confirmed in the most recent report of the United \r\nNations Development Programme.\r\nMauritania has worked to encourage international \r\naccord and has adopted a permanent policy of \r\nopenness. In that regard, many preparatory meetings \r\nand consultations were held with various factions of the \r\nopposition in order to reach agreement, culminating in \r\nan open political dialogue between the majority and the \r\nopposition in 2011, followed by another comprehensive \r\ndialogue, between 29 September and 20 October 2016, \r\nbetween the parties of the majority and certain parties \r\nof the opposition, as well as large sections of civil \r\nsociety and independent personalities. These resulted \r\nin constitutional amendments that were adopted by \r\nreferendum on 5 August 2017, which has enhanced \r\nour democracy and the rule of law, as well as the \r\nrationalization of public resources.\r\nThe elections held on 1 and 15 September provided \r\nan opportunity for the Mauritanian people to choose \r\ntheir representatives on the legislative, municipal, \r\nand local councils. In establishing the concept of \r\ndecentralization, for the first time in its history my \r\ncountry also witnessed the election of local councils \r\ntasked with developing various approaches to engaging \r\nlocal groups when dealing with their affairs. The \r\nelections were held under the supervision of an \r\nindependent electoral commission in an atmosphere of \r\npeace, security, transparency and fairness, as testified to \r\nby politicians, international observers from the African \r\nUnion and civil-society representatives. All politicians \r\nparticipated in those elections, and women occupied \r\na significant position in terms of candidatures as well \r\nas the number of seats won. Indeed, a woman is now \r\nchairing the local council of the Nouakchott district. \r\nThose results show the progress that women have \r\nmade in recent elections, thanks to national policies \r\nthat have enabled them to participate at all levels of \r\ndecision-making, including in political, military and \r\njudicial positions. There is also a quota for allocating \r\nseats to women in all elected positions.\r\nOur national leadership also attaches special \r\nimportance to young people and has established a \r\nmultidimensional strategy based on comprehensive \r\napproaches that deal with all aspects of interest to young \r\npeople in the areas of politics, intellectual achievement, \r\neducation, vocational training and employment. We \r\nhave also established a higher council for youth and a \r\nnational employment agency.\r\nHuman rights are a very important part of our \r\nnational policies and are embodied in our continuing \r\nefforts to entrench those rights, improve prison \r\nconditions, protect prisoners from torture and combat \r\nthe abuse of women and children, as well as definitively \r\neliminating any remnants of slavery. In that regard, our \r\nnational legislation classified slavery as a crime against \r\nhumanity as part of our 2012 constitutional amendments. \r\nThe legal system has also been bolstered by a group \r\nof laws and regulations that adopt new approaches, \r\nincluding establishing ad hoc courts that specialize \r\nin cases related to the remnants of slavery throughout \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 45/61\r\nthe country. In March 2014 we issued a road map that \r\nincludes the implementation of 29 recommendations on \r\ncombating slavery and its remnants, efforts that have \r\nbeen praised by the United Nations Special Rapporteur \r\non contemporary forms of slavery. My Government \r\nhas established a social-welfare agency working to \r\ncombat poverty and remnants of slavery. Its tasks \r\ninclude helping our most vulnerable groups by offering \r\nhealth care and educational services and funding \r\nincome-generating projects.\r\nThis year our country, which supported the South \r\nAfrican people in their struggle against the policies \r\nof apartheid, welcomed the Nelson Mandela Peace \r\nSummit (see A/73/PV.4 and 5) honouring the great role \r\nof the late Nelson Mandela. In that regard, I would like \r\nto recall that we honoured the late leader and advocate \r\nMadiba by naming one of our capital’s largest streets \r\nafter him. The African Union Summit also recently held \r\nevents in Nouakchott specially dedicated to honouring \r\nhis centenary, with a view to recalling the values and \r\nideals for which he fought.\r\nMauritania’s unique geographic position, together \r\nwith its Arab and African affiliations, gives it a \r\nparticular responsibility with regard to the security, \r\neconomic and human systems in the subregion. We \r\nhave fully assumed that responsibility and played a \r\npivotal role in establishing the Group of Five for the \r\nSahel (G-5). Mauritania has worked practically to help \r\nform the Joint Force of the G-5 for the Sahel, which is \r\ncurrently fighting terrorist organizations in the region. \r\nIn that connection, Mauritania is working to achieve \r\nharmony and amity in the subregion by adopting a firm \r\npolicy of good-neighbourliness and disengagement \r\nfrom any conflict. We are also closely following the \r\nWestern Sahara issue, and we support United Nations \r\nefforts to reach a settlement that is acceptable to the \r\nrelevant parties and contributes to achieving economic \r\nintegration between the countries of the Arab \r\nMaghreb Union.\r\nThe question of Palestine is extremely important to \r\nMauritania and is reflected in our firm position on the \r\nissue. We have consistently called for a viable equitable \r\nsolution based on the relevant Arab and international \r\nterms of reference and capable of leading to the \r\nestablishment of an independent State of Palestine with \r\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.\r\nWith regard to the Libyan issue, we support the \r\nUnited Nations efforts and other complementary \r\ntracks, including the work of the African Union Ad \r\nHoc High-level Committee on Libya, the Quartet and \r\nLibya’s neighbours.\r\nRegarding the situation in Syria, we underscore the \r\nneed to strive seriously for a political solution through a \r\ncomprehensive national dialogue that preserves Syria’s \r\nunity and independence, as well as the dignity of its \r\npeople and their right to live in security and peace. As \r\nfor brotherly Yemen, we reiterate our support for the \r\nlegitimate leadership of President Abdrabuh Mansour \r\nHadi Mansour. We call for an end to division and the \r\nadoption of a peaceful solution based on the three terms \r\nof reference. We also support United Nations efforts \r\naimed at reaching a political solution to that crisis. We \r\naffirm our support to the Government of Somalia in \r\nrestoring security and stability in its territory and once \r\nagain condemn all terrorist activities that target vital \r\ncentres in Somalia.\r\nConcerning the Rohingya Muslims, we reiterate \r\nour firm condemnation of the killings and displacement \r\ninflicted on that minority group, and call on the \r\ninternational community to shoulder its responsibilities \r\nin putting an end to that oppressed people’s suffering.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm Mauritania’s \r\nrespect for all of its international commitments. \r\nWe honour the multilateral international order and \r\nthe principles of the United Nations, which seek to \r\nestablish a world of security and stability where people \r\nlive in prosperity and peace. Mauritania stands ready \r\nto work with its partners to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Aurelia Frick, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Justice \r\nand Culture of the Principality of Liechtenstein.\r\nMs. Frick (Liechtenstein): It is a great joy and \r\npersonal satisfaction for me to see a woman presiding \r\nover the General Assembly. This is the tenth time that I \r\nhave had the honour to speak in this historic Hall, and \r\nit is the first time in all those years that a woman has \r\nheld the highest office here at the General Assembly. \r\nI salute her leadership, and we will support her. But \r\nit is also disappointing to see that the United Nations, \r\nwhich should be a trailblazer on the path of women’s \r\nempowerment, so frequently misses opportunities to \r\nmake appointments that resonate outside this building. I \r\nam therefore all the more grateful to Secretary-General \r\nGuterres for his commitment to gender parity. His \r\nresolve has illustrated that that goal can be achieved \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n46/61 18-30073\r\nrelatively quickly. We have yet to realize full gender \r\nequality in practice back home in Liechtenstein, and \r\nwe will continue to look to the United Nations to set \r\nexamples that guide us on our own path.\r\nThe United Nations is the most important peace \r\nproject the world has ever seen. It has shaped the way we \r\nhave lived together for more than seven decades. It was \r\ncreated out of the belief that the world could not afford \r\nanother armed confrontation between its most powerful \r\nStates, with its devastating consequences for everybody. \r\nIt was created on the basis of a collective system for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, based \r\non common values and common purposes.\r\nThe early years of the work of the United Nations \r\nillustrated the enthusiasm with which States seized the \r\nopportunity they had created for themselves. There \r\nwas a strong focus on the most painful open wounds \r\ncaused by the Second World War. The true dimensions \r\nof the horror of the Holocaust gradually became public \r\nknowledge, not least through the trials in Nuremberg, \r\nand the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment \r\nof the Crime of Genocide was adopted as a result. \r\nInfluenced by the vivid impressions of the horrors of \r\nHiroshima and Nagasaki, in its very first resolution \r\n(resolution 1(I)) the General Assembly set a goal of \r\neliminating all nuclear weapons. We are still far from \r\nachieving it, and the path so far has been rough. But \r\nwe have finally charted a way forward by adopting the \r\nTreaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons last year. \r\nI congratulate the 19 countries that have already ratified \r\nthe Treaty, and we will do our best to follow suit.\r\nThe United Nations has also been a place where we \r\nhave developed human rights standards, the rules that \r\nguide the relationship between the State and the human \r\nperson, individually and collectively. The Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights began that inspiring \r\ntrajectory. Eleanor Roosevelt, one of my personal role \r\nmodels, made a decisive contribution to its conclusion. \r\nSeventy years later, there can be no question that \r\nevery individual on this planet is entitled to enjoy all \r\nthe rights reflected in the Declaration. An impressive \r\nnumber of groundbreaking treaties have been built on \r\nits foundations, a very proud record. More than any \r\nother, the area of human rights reflects the spirit of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, written on behalf of the \r\npeoples, not their Governments.\r\nDevelopment became another key mission in this \r\nbuilding. In fact, for many of its Members, the United \r\nNations is the world’s most important platform in \r\nthat respect. That is also an agenda that we shaped \r\ntogether. We agreed on the right to development and \r\nmade it clear that development, human rights and peace \r\nand security belong together. That effort has been \r\ncrowned by the Sustainable Development Goals, which \r\nwill guide our work until 2030. They offer a historic \r\nopportunity, and we owe it to our children not to miss it.\r\nThe challenge of climate change is a perfect \r\nillustration of the indispensability of the United \r\nNations. We ourselves have created a threat to our \r\nsheer existence as the human race and as individuals. \r\nThe threat knows no national borders and makes no \r\ndistinctions. We are all equally affected, and we can \r\nonly overcome it together. Our very survival is at stake, \r\nand yet we are significantly behind in terms of what \r\nmust be done. The Secretary-General is right to sound \r\nthe alarm. That is one of his responsibilities. It is up to \r\nus, all of us, to act.\r\nAll of this can lead to only one conclusion. We \r\nneed more of the United Nations, not less. We need a \r\nUnited Nations that is more effective, cooperative and \r\ndynamic, more in tune with the times we live in, and yet \r\nour efforts have been distracted. We see tendencies to \r\nrevert to a paradigm that resulted in enormous suffering \r\nin the past and would certainly be disastrous today. \r\nWilful blindness, a disregard for realities, denial of the \r\nfacts and appeals to fear and resentment are recipes for \r\ndisaster. We have witnessed a downward spiral in that \r\nconversation. It has been rapid and today has led us to a \r\npoint where the fundamentals of what we have created \r\ntogether are under attack.\r\nThe Charter is our main reference point as we \r\nreflect on the most pressing challenges of the day. One \r\nparagraph from the Preamble stands out this year:\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations \r\ndetermined ... to establish conditions under which \r\njustice and respect for the obligations arising from \r\ntreaties and other sources of international law can \r\nbe maintained”.\r\nToday more than ever we are challenged in our \r\ndetermination to do just that. Today we can no longer \r\ntake it for granted that those conditions exist. The \r\nquestioning of international agreements and norms \r\nin the areas of trade, climate change, disarmament, \r\nmigration and human rights has one common thread. It \r\nnot only undermines the contents of those agreements, \r\nit is an attack on the rules-based order as such. It runs \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 47/61\r\ncontrary to the pledge that we are all committed to \r\nunder the Charter, that is, to respecting our obligations \r\nunder international law.\r\nIn the course of this debate, speakers have expressed \r\ntheir overwhelming support for the international rules-\r\nbased order. That gives us hope and inspiration to \r\ntackle the challenges we are facing. Let us be clear. \r\nWe have to work harder to make the United Nations fit \r\nfor purpose. Most worryingly, we still have a Security \r\nCouncil that is least functional when it is most needed. \r\nWhile addressing our weaknesses, we must also make \r\nbetter use of our strengths, particularly the power of the \r\nAssembly. It has the legal and political authority to build \r\ninstitutions and set policies that are game-changers.\r\nOne such institution is the International, \r\nImpartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the \r\nInvestigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible \r\nfor the Most Serious Crimes under International Law \r\ncommitted in the Syrian Arab Republic since March \r\n2011. We were proud to lead the way in its creation two \r\nyears ago. Born out of frustration over a deadlock in \r\nthe Security Council, it has quickly become a symbol \r\nof what the Assembly can achieve and a beacon of hope \r\nfor Syria. At this critical moment in the Syrian conflict, \r\nour resolve to ensure accountability for the crimes \r\ncommitted will shape the country’s future.\r\nWe are confronted by a very different situation, \r\nwith a similar massive accountability challenge, in the \r\natrocities committed against the Rohingya population \r\nby the authorities in Myanmar, which are shocking to all \r\nof us. There can be no voluntary return for the hundreds \r\nof thousands forcibly displaced into Bangladesh unless \r\nwe can ensure a credible accountability process. We now \r\nhave a direct path to justice, because the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) has ruled that it can exercise \r\njurisdiction over the crime of forced deportation. That \r\ncreates a new and expeditious policy option for the 123 \r\nStates among us that have joined the Rome Statute, in \r\nthat we can now come together and refer the situation \r\nin Cox’s Bazar to the ICC. I hope that conversation will \r\ntake place here in New York over the next few weeks.\r\nFrom Syria to Myanmar to Venezuela, the \r\nInternational Criminal Court is at the centre of the \r\neffort to fight impunity. Its creation 20 years ago was \r\nperhaps the most important advance in the recent \r\nhistory of international law. It fulfilled a vision that \r\nhad eluded us for a century. Today it is an institution \r\nthat is imperfect but, more importantly, indispensable. \r\nIt is a telling fact that at a time when there seems to be \r\na general questioning of the rules-based order, the ICC \r\nfinds itself under particular attack from various sides. \r\nWe need that Court more than ever, and more than ever, \r\nwe must be ready to stand up for it.\r\nThe issue of modern slavery and human trafficking \r\nis particularly disturbing to the Liechtenstein \r\nGovernment. Seventy years ago, in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, we agreed that no one \r\nshould be held in slavery or servitude. Today more than \r\n40 million people, predominantly women and girls, \r\nlive in such conditions. That is unacceptable. We have \r\njoined forces with our partners from Australia and the \r\nUnited Nations University and created the Financial \r\nSector Commission on Modern Slavery and Human \r\nTrafficking. Its task is to design a response so that \r\nactors in the financial sector can help eliminate modern \r\nslavery and ensure that perpetrators are brought to \r\njustice. I am proud to serve as its co-convener, together \r\nwith Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus. We are \r\nunder no illusions about the magnitude of the task, but \r\nwe are encouraged that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment has created such a strong impetus for \r\nfinally eliminating slavery, and we stand ready to take \r\nthat opportunity, together with everyone here.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Lejeune Mbella Mbella, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Cameroon.\r\nMr. Mbella Mbella (Cameroon) (spoke in French): \r\nOn behalf of His Excellency Paul Biya, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cameroon, I would first like to offer the \r\nPresident our sincere and warm congratulations on her \r\nelection to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-third \r\nsession. This is a historic moment, given that she is only \r\nthe fourth woman to preside over the Assembly in the 73 \r\nyears of the existence of the United Nations. I am sure \r\nthat her diplomatic background and knowledge of the \r\nUnited Nations system will guarantee her success in the \r\nperformance of her duties. I would also like to express \r\nmy gratitude to her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, \r\nwho distinguished himself through his contribution to \r\nadvancing the values of the Organization we share. I \r\nwould also like to congratulate Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres on his commitment to accomplishing \r\nthe delicate tasks assigned to him by the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and on his efforts to carry out reforms \r\naimed at achieving a more effective United Nations that \r\nis focused on people and development.\r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n48/61 18-30073\r\nMy delegation welcomes the theme that the \r\nPresident chose for this session, namely, “Making the \r\nUnited Nations relevant to all people: global leadership \r\nand shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies”. Persistent hotbeds of tension, in \r\nparticular in Africa and the Near and Middle East, as well \r\nas the emergence of new issues such as terrorism, violent \r\nextremism, migration, natural disasters and climate \r\nchange, to name but a few, threaten the foundations of \r\nour civilization and bring to the forefront the issue of \r\nthe ability of the United Nations to provide adequate \r\nresponses to contemporary problems. The expanding \r\nscope of global public goods now makes it essential \r\nthat the Organization be capable of being, in the words \r\nof the Charter, a centre for harmonizing the actions of \r\nnations in the attainment of those common ends.\r\nThe growing complexity of the problems of our \r\ntime, as well as the unprecedented interdependence \r\nof nations and peoples, require collective action and \r\nglobal solutions. The United Nations is today the best \r\nreflection and embodiment of multilateralism, which \r\nis, more than ever before, the most appropriate way to \r\nrespond to the challenges facing humankind. That is \r\nthe very essence of our Organization, which, it should \r\nbe recalled, was created to save succeeding generations \r\nfrom war, promote social progress and create better \r\nliving conditions for all peoples.\r\nTo that end, my country believes that the role \r\nand future of the United Nations continue to depend \r\non the willingness of Member States to strengthen its \r\nlegitimacy, democratization and representativeness, so \r\nas not to leave anyone behind. That necessarily involves \r\nreforms of its organs, including the Security Council. \r\nIn that respect, we cannot continue to marginalize \r\nAfrica, which remains the only continent that does not \r\nhave a permanent seat in the main body in charge of \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe role and future of the United Nations also \r\ndepend on the equitable treatment of its three pillars: \r\ninternational peace and security, development and \r\nhuman rights. We must not lose sight of the fact that \r\nhuman beings, whose development depends on living \r\nconditions, are at the heart of the Organization’s \r\nobjectives. The complex relationship between peace, \r\ndevelopment and human rights allows us to consider the \r\neradication of poverty and the improvement of people’s \r\nliving conditions as the surest means of achieving \r\nlasting peace, adequate protection of the individual \r\nand viable democracy. As President Paul Biya stated \r\nseveral years ago, democracy without development is \r\na delusion that gives rise to terrible disappointments.\r\nIn recent months, the news has been dominated \r\nin particular by moving images of men, women and \r\nchildren who lost their lives trying to cross seas and \r\nborders in search of a better future. We cannot remain \r\ninsensitive to that issue. In the framework of the \r\nglobal compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, \r\nwhich will be adopted during the intergovernmental \r\nconference scheduled for December in Morocco, we \r\nmust acknowledge the fact that poverty, unemployment, \r\nweakening purchasing power and, in short, uncertain \r\nfutures constitute so many violations of human dignity \r\nand, consequently, so many breaches of the peace, so \r\nmany causes of political instability, so many drivers \r\nof migration, which, if nothing is done, will be neither \r\nsafe nor orderly nor regular. The question of migratory \r\nf lows should therefore draw the attention of our \r\ncollective conscience and remind us of the importance \r\nof effective solidarity and shared prosperity.\r\nWith regard to collective security, we remain \r\nconvinced that the settlement of international or \r\ndomestic disputes must be carried out in conformity \r\nwith the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nIn addition, we must redouble our efforts to achieve \r\ndisarmament. In that regard, Cameroon believes, \r\nhowever, that the attention and resources devoted \r\nto the issue of nuclear and chemical weapons should \r\nnot overshadow the centrality of the problem posed \r\nby small arms and light weapons on the international \r\nagenda. It should be noted that, according to available \r\nstatistics, more than 90 per cent of the victims of war \r\naround the world, and particularly in Africa, are killed \r\nby that type of weapon. In addition, small arms and \r\nlight weapons are increasingly falling into the hands of \r\nterrorist groups such as the Islamic State, Al-Qaida in \r\nthe Islamic Maghreb, Boko Haram and others.\r\nCameroon is pleased to have hosted, in Yaoundé \r\nfrom 11 to 13 June, the first Central African Convention \r\nfor the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons, Their \r\nAmmunition and All Parts and Components That Can \r\nBe Used for Their Manufacture, Repair and Assembly. \r\nUnder the leadership of my country, which holds \r\nthe biennial presidency of that first Conference, the \r\nCentral African States have unreservedly committed \r\nto combating the proliferation of small arms and light \r\nweapons in all States parties to the Kinshasa Convention \r\nby mobilizing adequate operational — both institutional \r\nand logistical — resources. The Central African States \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 49/61\r\nintend to strengthen, among themselves and with other \r\npartners, including the United Nations, cooperation, \r\ncoordination, networking and the interoperability \r\nof resources for the effective implementation of the \r\nKinshasa Convention to combat the illicit circulation of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons. Cameroon knows that it \r\ncan count on the support of the United Nations and the \r\nSecretary-General.\r\nWith regard to the global economic situation, \r\ndespite signs of recovery, growth in many regions \r\nremains below the levels needed for rapid progress \r\ntowards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs). It is therefore necessary to increase the net \r\ninternational financial f lows to developing countries, \r\nwhich have declined in recent years. However, we \r\nshould not deceive ourselves — honouring official \r\ndevelopment assistance commitments alone will not \r\nmake it possible to meet all the funding needs for \r\nachieving the SDGs. The means of implementation set \r\nout in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development \r\nshould, therefore, be fully mobilized at all levels.\r\nHere I would emphasize the need to change the \r\neconomic structure of most African economies, which \r\nfocus economic activity on the extractive industries \r\nand the commodity-production sectors. Owing to the \r\nlimited impact of other sectors, such production patterns \r\ngenerate few jobs and promote inequality, while sowing \r\nthe seeds of social unrest. The solution lies, therefore, \r\nin transforming the African economies, particularly \r\nthrough industrialization and economic diversification. \r\nIt is therefore more appropriate than ever to provide \r\nmore support to African countries in order to help them \r\nto reduce their debt burden, improve their production \r\ncapacities and, lastly, help their products gain access to \r\nglobal markets under more favourable conditions.\r\nWith regard to the specific case of international \r\ntrade, Africa still faces the threat of protectionism, to \r\nwhich, in our view, the most appropriate solution is the \r\nestablishment of a universal multilateral trading system \r\nbased on open, transparent, predictable, inclusive, \r\nnon-discriminatory and fair rules, in line with the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. Cameroon is aware of \r\nits responsibilities in the current context. The challenge \r\nof achieving collective prosperity in my country means \r\nadopting ambitious and realistic development policies \r\nand programmes and instilling democratic values in our \r\nsociopolitical life, as well as including good governance \r\nand the fight against corruption on our priority agenda.\r\nOn the economic front more specifically, my country \r\nhas resolutely pursued the development of productive, \r\nstructural and promising sectors, without which we \r\ncannot envisage improving the living conditions of \r\nthe population. That is the objective of our long-term \r\nvision, whose goal, in line with the political agenda \r\nof President Biya, is to make Cameroon an emerging \r\ncountry by 2035.\r\nOn the environmental front, my country, which was \r\namong the first States to ratify the Paris Agreement, \r\nremains firmly committed to preserving biodiversity. \r\nTherefore, in order to protect the climatic balance of \r\nthe planet, Cameroon, a country in the Congo Basin \r\nand the second most forested country in Africa, \r\ntook the courageous decision not to make full use \r\nof its forests. In that regard, it is necessary to find \r\nurgent and appropriate solutions so as to reconcile \r\nthe environmental protection initiatives adopted by \r\nCameroon in the interest of all and the legitimate \r\naspirations of its people for their well-being.\r\nIn the same vein, Cameroon would like to reiterate \r\nthe need for a number of urgent actions to preserve \r\nLake Chad, which today has been reduced by more than \r\n90 per cent of its initial surface area. It is an issue of \r\nsurvival for the local communities, whose livelihoods \r\ndepend on preserving that body of water. Cameroon \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to express its sincere \r\ngratitude to the international donors that, in a spirit of \r\nsolidarity, pledged a total of €1.5 billion for that cause \r\nat the donor conference held in early September.\r\nWith regard to the democratic process in my \r\ncountry, we have improved our electoral system not only \r\nby strengthening electoral mechanisms but also through \r\nlegislative and regulatory measures designed to ensure \r\na high participation rate in upcoming electoral contests, \r\nthe next being the presidential election scheduled for \r\n7 October this year. The strengthening of democratic \r\nculture in Cameroon is an inevitable process despite the \r\nsecurity challenges that we face.\r\nThanks to the sacrifices of the entire Cameroonian \r\nnation, combined with efforts coordinated with our \r\nneighbours in the Lake Chad basin and the support of \r\nour international partners, the capacity of the Boko \r\nHaram terrorist group to do harm has been significantly \r\nreduced, although it is necessary to remain mobilized \r\nuntil its complete eradication.\r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n50/61 18-30073\r\nRegarding the sociopolitical situation in the North-\r\nWest and South-West regions, our Government remains \r\ndetermined to stabilize it. The corporatist demands of \r\nthe teachers’ and lawyers’ unions, which are at the root \r\nof that situation, have continued to be the subject of \r\nnegotiations with those socioprofessional categories. \r\nSolutions, which have sometimes gone beyond the \r\nproblems raised, have been found.\r\nUnfortunately — and Cameroon wishes to state \r\nthis from this rostrum — individuals without faith or \r\nlaw thought it necessary to turn those socioprofessional \r\nconcerns into secessionist demands aimed at breaking \r\nup the State, going outside constitutional and democratic \r\nmechanisms. Having chosen as their modus operandi the \r\nperpetration of terrorist acts, armed gangs have burned \r\nschools and hospitals and violated children’s right to \r\neducation by preventing them from going to school and \r\nby kidnapping and killing department officials, defence \r\nand security officers and indigenous authorities, as \r\nwell as any citizen who does not subscribe to their \r\ndestructive ideology. To date, nearly 100 members of \r\nthe armed forces of our country have lost their lives \r\nwithout including the many families overwhelmed by \r\nthose barbaric acts.\r\nThe current situation has led to the deterioration \r\nof both the economic fabric and the school and \r\nhealth systems of those two regions. That picture is \r\ncompounded by the fact that people have been displaced \r\nwithin the national territory and towards Nigeria, a \r\nneighbouring friendly country. In the light of all this, our \r\nGovernment is working to restore peace and security in \r\nboth regions, with respect for human rights and the laws \r\nand regulations of the Republic. In addition, sensitive \r\nto the plight of the populations concerned, the President \r\nof the Republic, His Excellency Paul Biya, decided to \r\nimplement, on 21 June, an emergency humanitarian \r\nassistance plan for the people of the two regions with \r\na provisional budget of CFA 12.7 billion. The funds \r\nallocated to the plan are being complemented by \r\nfinancing from a remarkable outpouring of solidarity \r\nand generosity from all other regions and segments of \r\nthe Cameroonian population.\r\nCameroon, a former trusteeship territory of the \r\nUnited Nations, invites the Assembly and all States \r\nand peoples who are friends of Cameroon and who are \r\ncommitted to peace and justice to support it in mobilizing \r\nresources and implementing that humanitarian plan \r\nwith a view to providing better assistance to those \r\npopulations. The Government would like to express \r\nits gratitude to our partners who, since the launch of \r\nthat plan, have spontaneously given us their support. \r\nIn any case, the Government of Cameroon would like \r\nto reaffirm its dedication to peace and stability and its \r\nresolve to take into account the concerns of the people. \r\nWe have shown on several occasions, and we reiterate \r\ntoday, our openness to dialogue, but with strict respect \r\nfor the institutions and laws of the Republic.\r\nStrong measures have already been taken to \r\naddress the situation that I mentioned. I would like \r\nto note, for example, the creation of the National \r\nCommission for the Promotion of Bilingualism and \r\nMulticulturalism and a fully f ledged ministry in \r\ncharge of decentralization. The aim is to accelerate a \r\nshift towards the management of local affairs by the \r\nconcerned populations themselves.\r\nMs. Ioannou (Cyprus), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe Government of Cameroon wishes to reiterate \r\nits unwavering commitment to ensuring the security of \r\npersons and property, as well as to protecting its national \r\nunity and integrity. In that regard, the Government \r\nwelcomes the rejection by the entire population of \r\nCameroon, and especially by the people of those two \r\nregions, of any attempt at secession.\r\nIn conclusion, Cameroon, a country whose \r\nindependence was led and supervised by the United \r\nNations, would like to reaffirm in this Hall not only \r\nits faith in our Organization, but also its commitment \r\nto peace and stability, without which no development \r\nis possible.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Augustine Phillip Mahiga, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, East Africa, Regional and International \r\nCooperation of the United Republic of Tanzania.\r\nMr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania): I wish \r\nto congratulate the President on her well-deserved \r\nelection to preside over the work of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session. Her election to \r\nthat prestigious position as the fourth woman in that \r\npost in the history of the Organization and the first \r\nfrom Latin America is not only a unique accolade to \r\nher person, but also a testimony bestowed on her by \r\nthe States Members of the United Nations. In that \r\nregard, Tanzania pledges its full support to her and her \r\nentire Office.\r\nI also wish to pay special tribute to her predecessor, \r\nHis Excellency Miroslav Lajčák, for his successful \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 51/61\r\nleadership and commitment to the General Assembly \r\nduring his presidency at the previous session. We wish \r\nhim well in his future endeavours. In the same manner, \r\nI commend Secretary-General António Guterres for his \r\ntireless efforts to steer the work of our Organization, \r\nespecially in implementing the challenging reforms \r\nthat are under way under his stewardship.\r\nI am greatly honoured to address the Assembly on \r\nbehalf of my President, His Excellency Mr. John Pombe \r\nJoseph Magufuli, who could not join his colleagues in \r\nthe Assembly owing to the tragic ferry accident that \r\nclaimed the lives of more than 200 Tanzanians and left \r\nmany others injured. We appreciate the support of the \r\ninternational community during this difficult moment. \r\nMay the souls of the departed rest in eternal peace.\r\nBefore I proceed, let me express the condolences \r\nof the Government of Tanzania to the United Nations \r\ncommunity and the entire world on the demise of \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, an outstanding humanitarian and a \r\ndefender and advocate of multilateralism. Our thoughts \r\nand prayers are with his family, relatives and friends. \r\nMay his soul rest in eternal peace.\r\nThis year’s theme, “Making the United Nations \r\nrelevant to all people: global leadership and shared \r\nresponsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties”, is very captivating and timely in reinforcing \r\nglobal governance to ensure the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That \r\nimpetus from the United Nations comes at a time when \r\nmultilateralism is eroding and needs to be rescued with \r\ncollective and determined efforts.\r\nToday, we are living in a world where most societies \r\nare neither peaceful and equitable nor sustainable. The \r\nworld is still facing many violent conflicts and wars \r\nresulting in a massive loss of lives, and the threat of \r\nterrorism, the destruction of the environment, refugee \r\ninfluxes, displaced persons and global migration, \r\nhunger and poverty persist in many parts of the world. \r\nAddressing those challenges requires a collective \r\nvisionary leadership and governance.\r\nUnfortunately, all those miseries are mainly \r\nhuman-made and could be prevented if we resolved to \r\ntake collective measures. Continued and meaningful \r\ncooperation among Member States is a prerequisite \r\nin addressing all of the challenges confronting the \r\nworld. Through such a platform, we could accentuate \r\nthe relevance of this body to all nations and the people. \r\nFurthermore, we could shape global policies and norms \r\nto respond to the various needs of our diverse cultures \r\nand societies. A call for the United Nations to be \r\nrelevant to all people is therefore timely; and indeed, \r\nit is in accordance with the Organization’s purposes \r\nand principles as enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIt is in facing those global challenges that \r\nmultilateralism at all levels of response, and especially \r\nthrough the United Nations and its institutions, \r\nbecomes essential to ensuring peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies. It is an undeniable fact that \r\nevery sovereign State in the international system seeks \r\nto maximize its national interests and the well-being \r\nof its citizens. However, acting alone and in isolation \r\nminimizes the potential for realizing the desired optimal \r\nresults. Globalization and the intricate web of relations \r\nthat have subsequently emerged globally render a \r\nmultilateral approach to issues of national, regional and \r\ninternational concern essential and unavoidable.\r\nUnfortunately, the world is witnessing multilateral \r\ninstitutions and principles being put to the test. For \r\nexample, the World Trade Organization, which has \r\nbeen the pillar and yardstick of the rule-based and \r\nfair global trading system, is being now undermined. \r\nClimate change and global warming, which are already \r\nwreaking havoc on lives and property in all regions \r\nregardless of national borders, can be addressed \r\neffectively only through multilateral approaches. \r\nAbove all, it is the post-Second World War multilateral \r\nedifice and institutions that have given us the peace we \r\nwitness today, albeit an imperfect one. We should be \r\nseeking to improve the shortcomings in the multilateral \r\nsystem that we have created for ourselves and for a \r\nbetter world, rather than walking away from it.\r\nTanzania is unreservedly committed to multilateralism \r\nin pursuit of its national interests. It is also through \r\nunmitigated multilateralism that we will be able to \r\naddress critical global challenges, such as terrorism, \r\nextremism, radicalism, climate change, restrictive trade \r\npolicies, trafficking in persons, drug abuse, pandemic \r\ndiseases, absolute and abject poverty, immigration \r\ndynamics and weapons of mass destruction, just to \r\nmention a few. We are encouraged by the united chorus \r\nfrom the General Assembly in defence of multilateralism \r\nand in defence of the purposes and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations, which bind all of us together.\r\nWe have seen diplomatic engagement work \r\nsuccessfully to bring adversaries to a round table to \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n52/61 18-30073\r\naddress their differences peacefully. Tanzania wishes \r\nto endorse the continuous use of diplomatic means and \r\nround-table negotiations to address conflicts between \r\nand among nations. It is in that regard that Tanzania, as a \r\npeaceful and stable country, has assisted and witnessed \r\nthe value of brokering peace. Tanzania welcomes the \r\nrecent talks between the United States and North Korea \r\non the Korean nuclear deal, which paved the way for the \r\nrecent signing of an agreement between North Korea \r\nand the Republic of Korea. We hope that deal and \r\nothers that have followed the same pattern will yield the \r\nanticipated positive outcomes sooner rather than later, \r\nincluding resolving the long outstanding humanitarian \r\nissues in the Korean peninsula. Those are some of \r\nthe good examples of successful outcomes resulting \r\nfrom diplomatic engagements around the world. All \r\nthose efforts have confirmed the value of dialogue in \r\nresolving and preventing conflicts.\r\nReforms are necessary both for continuity and \r\nfor change. For the past decades, the Assembly has \r\ncontinuously been discussing reforms of the United \r\nNations and its institutions so that it can respond \r\neffectively to the current global economic, political, \r\nsocial and changing security dynamics. That is the \r\nway to make our Organization alive and relevant. \r\nCurrently, the reforms are focusing on the United \r\nNations development system, management, and peace \r\nand security. My delegation strongly believes that the \r\nreforms will be objective and balanced.\r\nTanzania supports the reforms of the United Nations, \r\nespecially those relating to the Security Council, and \r\nreiterates the position of Africa as contained in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration, which we \r\nendorse. In addition, Tanzania urges the international \r\ncommunity to make the process transparent, inclusive \r\nand democratic. All countries, poor and rich, must \r\nhave equal participation, and their voices and positions \r\nmust be heard and taken seriously. After many years \r\nof almost stalemated negotiations on Security Council \r\nreforms, it is necessary to move the process forward, \r\nbut in a manner that will preserve the interests and \r\npositions of all parties concerned in a transparent \r\nconsultative manner.\r\nWe ought to remind ourselves that the credibility of \r\nthe United Nations rests on a fully representative and \r\nresponsive Security Council. The Council is what it is \r\ntoday and the reforms are not advancing well because \r\nof the veto. If we are to make meaningful reforms, we \r\nshould, first of all and foremost, be bold enough to \r\ndecide on the future use of the veto. In that respect, \r\nmy delegation wishes to stress that issues relating to \r\nthe veto and the expansion of the membership and \r\ncategories should be addressed as a package and not \r\nin isolation.\r\nOver the years, and with the support of the \r\ninternational community and development partners, \r\nTanzania has successfully implemented various national \r\ndevelopment plans that have significantly contributed to \r\nthe reduction of poverty. Furthermore, we are proud to \r\nhave incorporated the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) into our national development agenda in order \r\nto accelerate economic growth and eradicate poverty. \r\nDrawing on experiences from the implementation of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, it is apparent that \r\nthe implementation of the SDGs requires adequate, \r\nsustainable and predictable funding, especially to \r\nassist least developed countries like mine. Thus, the \r\nmobilization of long-term innovative public and private \r\nfinancing is key to the realization of those Goals.\r\nTanzania has embarked on systematic legal and \r\nadministrative reforms of mechanisms that have been \r\nhampering resource mobilization and accountability. \r\nThe Government has embarked on a relentless fight \r\nagainst corruption and public-service incompetence \r\nin order to increase accountability and transparency. \r\nThe Government has undertaken stringent measures to \r\nfight drug and human trafficking, illicit trade in ivory \r\nand violent extremism. As expected, those measures \r\nhave generated determined resistance on the part of \r\nvested economic interests and criminal elements. \r\nIn response, the Government has needed to take \r\nappropriate countermeasures that have sometimes been \r\nmisunderstood as being too restrictive. Despite those \r\nchallenges, Tanzania will continue to respect the rule \r\nof law, good governance, democracy and human rights, \r\nas enshrined in our Constitution.\r\nNotwithstanding the ongoing efforts to mobilize \r\ndomestic resources, developing countries continue to \r\nexperience global systemic issues relating to unfair tax \r\nregimes and illicit financial f lows, which contribute to \r\ncapital f light and deny those countries their rightful \r\nincome. We call upon the international community to \r\nredouble its efforts to tackle those systemic issues by, \r\namong other things, establishing an intergovernmental \r\ntax body under the United Nations to address the \r\nevasion and avoidance of taxes. That, in turn, will \r\nput more resources at our disposal for implementing \r\nthe SDGs.\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 53/61\r\nTanzania is among the top troop-contributing \r\ncountries to United Nations peacekeeping missions, \r\nand we have significantly contributed to the restoration \r\nof global peace and stability in many parts of the world. \r\nWe currently have 2,687 troops serving under the \r\nUnited Nations f lag in six different countries.\r\nRegrettably, Tanzania’s participation in peacekeeping \r\noperations has not been without incident. Some of our \r\npeacekeepers have been attacked and even killed. The \r\nDecember 2017 attack in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo was the worst in the past 25 years of United \r\nNations peacekeeping history. We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and all Member States that extended their \r\ncondolences to Tanzania and the families, friends and \r\nrelatives of the deceased. Our pain was eased by those \r\nwho stood with Tanzania during those difficult days. \r\nMay the souls of the departed rest in eternal peace.\r\nWe welcome the support of the United Nations, \r\nand we commend the Secretary-General for promptly \r\nforming a special investigation team that established \r\nthe causes of the attack and determined the actions to be \r\ntaken to prevent such hostile and cowardly incidents in \r\nfuture. We are also gratified that the recommendations \r\nof the investigation report will feature prominently \r\nin the Declaration of Shared Commitments on United \r\nNations Peacekeeping Operations, which Tanzania \r\nsupports. Tanzania looks forward to the implementation \r\nof those recommendations.\r\nI wish to remind the Assembly of the historic role \r\nplayed by Tanzania in hosting and providing sanctuary \r\nand protection to refugees from Central and Southern \r\nAfrica for decades. We have done so for humanitarian \r\nreasons, but also because of the internationally agreed \r\nprinciples to which we are signatory with regard to \r\nthe admission of asylum-seekers and the protection of \r\nrefugees. We are currently hosting more than 330,000 \r\nrefugees, mainly from Burundi and the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo. Over the decades of hosting \r\nrefugees, Tanzania has provided local integration and \r\ncitizenship to more than 150,000 refugees.\r\nApart from providing sanctuary to refugees, \r\nwe have also been involved in initiatives to resolve \r\nregional conflicts in the Great Lakes region, which \r\nhave the potential to increase refugee influxes into \r\nour country. In addition, as of September, Tanzania \r\nhas also assisted in the voluntary repatriation of more \r\nthan 46,000 Burundian refugees. The repatriation \r\nexercise was conducted transparently and inclusively \r\nin collaboration with the Burundian authorities, the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees (UNHCR) and other relevant development \r\npartners. Nevertheless, some misguided Burundian \r\nexiles have criticized the exercise as involuntary. The \r\ntruth is that the bottlenecks and constraints in the \r\nimplementation of the Tripartite Agreement are due to a \r\nlack of resources and to mixed progress in the political \r\nand security situation in Burundi.\r\nIn that connection, Tanzania appeals to the \r\ninternational community to facilitate and support \r\nthe ongoing voluntary repatriation of the remaining \r\nBurundian refugees while consultations continue \r\nbetween Tanzania, Burundi and the UNHCR. It is \r\nequally important to present a realistic assessment of the \r\nevolving political and security situation inside Burundi \r\nin order to enable the refugees to make informed and \r\nobjective decisions on returning to various parts of \r\nthe country.\r\nThe people of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo continue to face challenges to peace, security \r\nand stability. The country has continuously been \r\ndestabilized by warring factions and warlords, who \r\nhave wreaked havoc, leading to political instability in \r\nsome parts of the country, especially in the eastern part \r\nof the country. The situation has not only denied the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo the opportunity to \r\ndevelop its country and people, but has also undermined \r\nand threatened regional peace and security. However, \r\ncurrent efforts to address the protracted impasse are \r\nseeing some progress with regard to the Government’s \r\ncommitment to holding the long-awaited general \r\nelections later this year. The stability of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo would not only contribute to \r\naddressing the refugee problem, but would also improve \r\nthe prospects for regional trade and investment, as well \r\nas the economic prosperity of the region. There can be \r\nno better assurance of the future, progress in and status \r\nof the political situation of the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo than the statement delivered two days ago \r\nfrom this rostrum by President Joseph Kabila Kabange \r\n(see A/73/PV.7). To that end, it is necessary to continue \r\nwith the United Nations Organization Stabilization \r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\n(MONUSCO) and the Intervention Brigade, in which \r\nTanzania is a participant, in the eastern part of the \r\ncountry, until the elections in the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo are concluded.\r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n54/61 18-30073\r\nIn 2015, many world leaders who had gathered here \r\nwelcomed the historic and momentous decision taken \r\nby the United States of America and the Republic of \r\nCuba to restore diplomatic relations. For most of us, \r\nthat was the beginning of a harmonious coexistence \r\nwith high hopes and expectations. However, as time \r\nhas progressed, we feel and see that minimum efforts \r\nhave been made to meet such hopes and expectations, \r\nwhich ultimately should lead to the lifting the embargo \r\nthat has condemned the people of Cuba for many \r\nyears. We hope that through the power of reason and \r\nthe diplomatic means that led to the re-establishment \r\nof ties, the embargo on Cuba will be totally lifted and \r\nthat a new dawn of cooperation will follow, not only \r\nbetween the two countries but in the entire region of \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean.\r\nThe issue of self-determination for Western Sahara \r\nhas taken a new direction with Morocco re-joining the \r\nAfrican Union (AU), where it is a member of the Peace \r\nand Security Council. There is a renewed opportunity \r\nfor the United Nations and the Special Envoy of the \r\nSecretary-General to work with the newly established \r\nAU troika mechanism on Western Sahara to address the \r\nissue of that area. Tanzania supports that initiative and \r\nhopes that the process will gather momentum and reach \r\na new status soon.\r\nOn the question of Palestine, Tanzania reiterates its \r\nposition on resolving the conflict between Israel and \r\nPalestine through the two-State solution. We believe \r\nthat Palestine has the right to enjoy its independence \r\nand peace, just as Israel is entitled to peace and \r\nsecurity, in accordance with the provisions of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. It is our belief that it is \r\nwithin the creative and resourceful ability of Israel and \r\nthe determination of the Palestinian people to reach a \r\npeaceful solution that will permit Israel and Palestine \r\nto coexist in peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate Tanzania’s commitment to \r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations and \r\nto multilateralism. The Government of His Excellency \r\nJohn Magufuli stands ready to participate constructively \r\nin the search for peaceful solutions to conflicts and to \r\ncontribute to the United Nations mandate for conflict \r\nprevention and peacekeeping. Above all, we look \r\nto this Organization to continue championing the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand to support Tanzania’s own efforts to achieve those \r\nGoals as it heads towards a middle-income designation \r\nand furthers its ambition of industrialization.\r\nMay God bless us all and may God bless the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and International Cooperation of the Republic \r\nof Djibouti.\r\nMr. Youssouf (Djibouti) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I would like to offer our warm congratulations \r\nto the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session. Her many exceptional qualities bolster \r\nour deep conviction that she will successfully carry out \r\nher mission in the service of the nations of the world. \r\nDjibouti welcomes her election as President of the \r\nAssembly at this session in more ways than one. She \r\nis the fourth woman to hold this position in 73 years. \r\nWe assure her of my country’s support in carrying out \r\nher mandate.\r\nI would also like to commend the dynamism, faith \r\nand commitment of her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák. I also congratulate Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres on his many initiatives to advance the \r\nOrganization’s agenda and the ambitious United Nations \r\nreform plan designed and developed with the support \r\nof Member States. Even if there is a consensus on the \r\ngeneral need for reforms to make our Organization \r\nmore effective, it has not always been easy to convince \r\nMembers and overcome the resistance and burdens \r\noften faced by this type of major undertaking.\r\nDespite improvements in a number of indicators, \r\nsuch as life expectancy, living standards and a drastic \r\nreduction in the global rate of extreme poverty, \r\nthe observation we made last year in the General \r\nAssembly (see A/72/PV.19) remains valid. Even if \r\nsome parts of the world are experiencing growth, the \r\nrisks of diminished prospects loom large. Prospects for \r\neconomic expansion exacerbate the risk of increased \r\ntensions and trade disputes. Gross inequalities persist, \r\nand the major geopolitical upheavals under way \r\nare generating growing uncertainty. Similarly, the \r\npersistence and increased complexity of some conflicts \r\nis a major concern.\r\nThe number of people leaving their country because \r\ntheir lives are in danger is on the rise. More and more \r\npeople are leaving in search of a better life and taking \r\nto the sea, sometimes risking their lives in the process. \r\nThat migratory f low has unwittingly contributed \r\nto the emergence of a bitter political debate in many \r\nnorthern countries. Such fierce debates, if seen without \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 55/61\r\na dose of critical distance, could challenge the feeling \r\nof belonging to a common humanity bound by the \r\ncommon responsibility to build a better world together.\r\nThe crisis of multilateralism that we are witnessing, \r\nthe protectionist tendencies that we are observing, the \r\npalpable temptation of retreating into nationalism and \r\nsometimes even autism are the consequences of this \r\nemerging ideology. It posits that we must rely only \r\non ourselves, that we can only rely on ourselves, thus \r\ncontradicting the philosophical wisdom of Rimbaud: \r\n“I is another”. Hence the importance of this session’s \r\ntheme, “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”, as an \r\ninstrument to guide our collective reflection. All of our \r\nproposals and contributions could be compiled into a \r\nmanifesto to renew and restore the faith and confidence \r\nthat our peoples have in the United Nations system and \r\nits ability to respond to their problems.\r\nDjibouti welcomes the fact that in response to \r\neach of the perils mentioned above, the international \r\ncommunity has mobilized and formulated responses \r\nand developed action plans through particularly well-\r\nconducted intergovernmental processes. Among those \r\nsuccesses, I note the adoption of the reforms undertaken \r\nby the Secretary-General in some key areas — the \r\nrepositioning of the United Nations development system \r\nin the implementation of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment for humankind; management reform; and \r\nthe reform of the peace and security architecture.\r\nWe also note the finalization of the global compact \r\nfor safe, orderly and regular migration through an open, \r\ntransparent and inclusive process. It is set to be adopted \r\nin Marrakesh in December.\r\nSimilarly, the finalization of the global compact \r\non refugees, which will be submitted to the General \r\nAssembly for its consideration during this session, \r\nis a major development. Refugees are particularly \r\nvulnerable. Since the United Nations is unable to \r\naddress, in a sustainable manner, the causes of the \r\nconflicts that led to their exile, it must provide an \r\nadequate response to their needs.\r\nEfforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development encourage and motivate \r\nus. The current momentum to adopt and integrate \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals into national \r\nplanning and institutional initiatives should continue \r\nwith renewed energy. The aim should be to deepen \r\nreflection and exchanges, and to establish participatory \r\nframeworks and new partnership models. We must \r\nredirect investments to the improvement of data \r\ncollection on sustainable development and statistics \r\non gender, health, education and the environment. \r\nDjibouti is pleased to be able to present its first \r\nvoluntary review soon and considers this opportunity \r\nfor introspection beneficial.\r\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General’s strategy \r\nto mobilize increased resources for financing the \r\n2030 Agenda. In that regard, let me stress again that \r\nit will be necessary both to think about innovative \r\nfinancing strategies aimed at ensuring an increase in \r\nforeign direct investment and to honour development \r\naid commitments.\r\nThe greatest threat to the implementation of the \r\ntransformative agenda that is Agenda 2030 is undoubtedly \r\nconflict and violence. Conflicts in several parts of the \r\nworld continue to increase the death toll, and the nature \r\nof the specific challenges they pose will require the \r\nsustained attention of the international community. \r\nThe expansion of terrorism and international organized \r\ncrime further complicates already fragile situations \r\nand requires different responses than those proposed \r\nby conventional peace operations. It also sorely tests \r\nthe diplomatic negotiation tools at our disposal, which \r\nwe must urgently and thoroughly review.\r\nIn contrast to that gloomy picture, the Horn of Africa \r\nhas seen a series of historic positive developments \r\nthat are likely to generate peace dividends and lead \r\nto reconciliation and economic development. We \r\nwelcome the rapprochement between Ethiopia and \r\nEritrea, which ended two decades of neither war nor \r\npeace and inaugurated a new era of peace, friendship \r\nand cooperation between the two countries. The \r\npositive repercussions for other inter-State conflicts \r\nin the countries of the region have been rapid and, we \r\nhope, substantial.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to inform the Assembly \r\nthat the Presidents of Djibouti and Eritrea met on \r\n17 September in Jeddah, under the auspices of His \r\nMajesty King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud of Saudi \r\nArabia, and agreed to open a new chapter in relations \r\nbetween the two brotherly countries. At the end of the \r\nmeeting and thanks to the tireless efforts of the King \r\nof Saudi Arabia and the Ethiopian Prime Minister, \r\nAbiy Ahmed, the Presidents agreed to continue the \r\ndialogue with a view to finding a peaceful solution to \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n56/61 18-30073\r\nthe outstanding issues, including the border dispute and \r\nthe prisoners of war.\r\nWe also welcome the Peace Agreement signed \r\nbetween President Salva Kiir of South Sudan and the \r\nhead of the rebellion on 12 September in Addis Ababa \r\nunder the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority \r\non Development. We hope that it can be fully and \r\nunconditionally implemented. The South Sudanese \r\npeople have suffered too much. They deserves peace \r\nand the opportunity to build a better future.\r\nWe are encouraged by the tremendous progress \r\nmade by Somalia in building strong institutions and \r\nrestoring peace, stability and economic growth. \r\nAlthough we recognize the significant progress made, \r\nwe must work together to identify and combat the actors \r\nwho seek to block political normalization, particularly \r\nthe Al-Shabaab terrorist groups, and do all we can to \r\nbuild greater coherence and unity of action between \r\nthe federal Government and other federal units. We \r\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to the troops of the \r\nAfrican Union Military Observer Mission in Somalia \r\n(AMISOM), whose crucial role has been amply \r\ndemonstrated on the ground. AMISOM’s support of \r\nSomali forces is crucial to ensuring that the transfer of \r\nsecurity responsibilities can be carried out under the \r\nbest possible conditions.\r\nThe question of Palestine must continue to mobilize \r\nthe international community. There is no alternative \r\nto the two-State solution. Moreover, the issue of \r\nPalestinian refugees must also be of concern to us all.\r\nI would be remiss if I did not make mention of the \r\nsuffering of the Rohingya people, who today are being \r\nthreatened with ethnic cleansing, as the international \r\ncommunity has witnessed. We must pressure the \r\nGovernment of Myanmar to allow the return of the \r\nRohingyan refugees.\r\nThe United Nations has made a significant \r\ncontribution to the efforts to maintain international \r\npeace and security. It has played a crucial role in \r\npromoting international cooperation among States. It is \r\nthe responsibility of us all to strengthen its role and to \r\nmake it a global force.\r\nDjibouti is ready to work alongside the other nations \r\nof the world for the creation of a safer, more united and \r\nmore prosperous world. The stakes are high, and the \r\ncall is urgent. Long live the nations of the world! Long \r\nlive the United Nations!\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Workineh Gebeyehu Negewo, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.\r\nMr. Negewo (Ethiopia): Allow me to start \r\nby expressing my warmest congratulations to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-third \r\nsession. I can assure her of my delegation’s fullest \r\nsupport and cooperation in the effective discharge of \r\nher responsibilities. Let me also convey my sincere \r\nappreciation to her predecessor for his able leadership \r\nof the Assembly over the past year.\r\nThis year, the United Nations lost one of its \r\nicons, someone who rose through the ranks to lead \r\nthe Organization and who, as the Secretary-General \r\nrightly said, truly represented what the United Nations \r\nis all about. We mourn the loss of this illustrious son of \r\nAfrica, who left an enduring mark on the world stage, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan.\r\nWe are meeting at a time when multilateralism is \r\nfacing serious challenges, and yet there has never been \r\na time when we needed multilateralism more. That is \r\nwhy this gathering of nations under the umbrella of \r\nthe United Nations is so important. It remains the only \r\nuniversal Organization whose very ideals of freedom, \r\nequality and justice are still as valid today as they were \r\nat its inception. As the late Emperor Haile Selassie I of \r\nEthiopia stated in his address to the General Assembly \r\nin October 1963:\r\n“The Charter of the United Nations expresses \r\nthe noblest aspirations of man: the abjuration of \r\nforce in the settlement of disputes between States; \r\nthe assurance of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms for all, without distinction as to race, \r\nsex, language or religion; the safeguarding of \r\ninternational peace and security.” (A/PV.1229, \r\npara. 5)\r\nThat remains profoundly true. Let me take this \r\nopportunity today to assure the Assembly that Ethiopia, \r\nas a founding Member of the United Nations, will \r\ncontinue to adhere to those ideals and to the principles \r\nof multilateralism as we face unprecedented challenges \r\nand threats to our community of nations.\r\nEthiopia’s contribution to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping is second to none. We remain totally \r\ncommitted to that noble endeavour as we reform \r\nand adapt to the new and challenging realities of \r\npeacekeeping. We fully endorse the Secretary-\r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 57/61\r\nGeneral’s Action for Peacekeeping initiative and the \r\nDeclaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations \r\nPeacekeeping Operations to tackle the challenges \r\npeacekeeping faces today.\r\nSix months ago, a peaceful transfer of power \r\ntook place in Ethiopia. It opened a new chapter in our \r\ncountry’s political and social history, offering realistic \r\nand genuine possibilities for change that will meet the \r\nhopes and expectations of our youthful population. \r\nThose changes are in line with the new political and \r\ndemocratic realities that we are implementing and have \r\nbeen welcomed and embraced by Ethiopians across \r\nthe length and breadth of the country. Creating a just, \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable society is the vision \r\nthat we are supporting as we build a new society on \r\nthe foundations and achievements of the past. I believe \r\nthat vision is highly appropriate and relevant to our \r\ndiscussion here at this session of the General Assembly \r\nand to the theme selected for this general debate.\r\nEthiopia and its people have frequently shown their \r\nresilience and strength in times of adversity. We are quite \r\nconfident that we will continue to do so. No difficulties \r\nare insurmountable. Of course, there are challenges \r\nthat we continue to encounter in working to ensure that \r\nthe benefits of economic growth and development are \r\nwidely shared among all of our people. We are working \r\ntoday to broaden and deepen the necessary reforms in \r\norder to promote democratic governance and the rule of \r\nlaw, promote fairness and justice and better financial \r\nand economic management, ensure transparency \r\nand accountability in our governance, and foster \r\nparticipation in an effective democracy.\r\nIn the last six months, we have made every effort \r\nto ensure all of that, which, together with our message \r\nof forgiveness and reconciliation, strengthens the unity \r\nand solidarity of our people. The new Government, \r\nled by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, is taking a series \r\nof measures — opening up the democratic space in \r\nevery direction, opening up the economy and tackling \r\nobstacles to development, such as corruption, human \r\nrights violations, and failures of administration and \r\ngovernance. In other words, we continue to respond to \r\nthe hopes and aspirations of our people. Those reforms \r\nhave been welcomed across the country and beyond.\r\nWe have not confined our efforts to Ethiopia. There \r\nis another key historic development in our region. In \r\nthe last three months, my Prime Minister has embarked \r\nupon a significant reconciliation initiative across the \r\nHorn of Africa. It is the start of a genuine normalization \r\namong the countries of the Horn. Ethiopia and Eritrea \r\nhave opened a new chapter in their relationship, ending \r\ntwo decades of conflict. We are normalizing relations \r\nand charting a future in which our relationship will \r\ntruly reflect the long-standing ties between our peoples. \r\nSomalia and Eritrea have reconciled their differences \r\nand have re-established diplomatic relations.\r\nEarly this month, we held a trilateral summit \r\ninvolving Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia in Asmara. \r\nWe Foreign Ministers then visited Djibouti, opening a \r\nnew phase in relations between Djibouti and Eritrea. \r\nThe Chairperson of the African Union Commission \r\nhas rightly called that effort a clear demonstration of \r\nthe value and effectiveness of the search for African \r\nsolutions to African problems.\r\nRecently, my Prime Minister and the President of \r\nEritrea signed the Agreement on Peace, Friendship and \r\nComprehensive Cooperation in Jeddah. The Presidents \r\nof Eritrea and Djibouti shook hands in Jeddah, thus \r\nending a decade of dispute. In the light of those \r\nimportant and positive developments, it is appropriate \r\nand timely that the Security Council now, without \r\ndelay, seriously consider lifting the sanctions imposed \r\non Eritrea. A few days ago, the South Sudanese parties \r\nsigned the revitalized Agreement on the Resolution \r\nof the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan at \r\nan Extraordinary Summit of the Intergovernmental \r\nAuthority on Development Assembly of Heads of State \r\nand Government in Addis Ababa. The Agreement offers \r\na real prospect for peace in South Sudan after five years \r\nof civil war.\r\nThose are indeed major developments in the Horn \r\nof Africa. As the Secretary-General put it, a “powerful \r\nwind of hope is blowing across the Horn of Africa.” It \r\nis a wind that offers a start to the process of unravelling \r\nthe years of conflict and suspicion across a region that \r\nhas been one of the most conflict-ridden in Africa. The \r\nHorn of Africa is indeed becoming the hope of Africa.\r\nWhile all those major steps towards silencing \r\nthe guns in our region are taking place, it is equally \r\nimportant to extend the process to promote a framework \r\nfor regional economic integration to fight poverty. \r\nMoreover, regional economic cooperation will make \r\na real contribution to help do away with violence and \r\nwar, as well as promote deeper regional and continental \r\nintegration in line with the African Union Agenda 2063.\r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n58/61 18-30073\r\nIn the light of the challenges that we face together \r\nas a region, the choice we have is very clear — we must \r\nwork together for the collective destiny of our people. \r\nThe historical, cultural, social and linguistic links \r\nthat bind our peoples form a proper basis for striving \r\nfor common prosperity. We believe that regional \r\nintegration, which benefits all countries of the Horn, \r\nis our only viable option for meaningful development. \r\nWe are already seeing dividends through regional \r\nintegration projects. We are now working to accelerate \r\nsuch efforts, building on what we have already achieved.\r\nFinally, let me underline that Ethiopia will always \r\nremain firmly committed to making every possible \r\neffort to forge peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties in our subregion and our continent, Africa. \r\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security Council, \r\nwe have been doing everything we can to support that \r\nimportant and noble cause, and we will continue to do \r\nso in the spirit of and with a commitment to nurturing \r\npeace, security and stability for the common good of \r\nour countries.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Robert Dussey, Minister of State and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, Cooperation and Regional Integration \r\nof the Togolese Republic.\r\nMr. Dussey (Togo) (spoke in French): At the outset, \r\nI extend the warm congratulations of His Excellency \r\nMr. Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé, President of the \r\nTogolese Republic, to the President of the General \r\nAssembly on her well-deserved election to preside over \r\nthe Assembly at its seventy-third session. I also assure \r\nher of the support of my country, Togo.\r\nAt the same time, I would like to pay a well-deserved \r\ntribute to Mr. Miroslav Lajčák for the masterful \r\nleadership he showed during his term as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at the previous session. I am also \r\nparticularly pleased to commend the sense of human \r\naffairs and practical wisdom of the Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres. We appreciate his clearly expressed \r\ncommitment and daily work in support of the principles \r\nand values of the Organization, which we share.\r\nI would like to welcome the relevance of the \r\nchoice of the theme for this session, which draws the \r\nattention of all of us to a challenge that is essential, \r\nbecause it is fundamental: decentralizing the exercise \r\nof responsibilities at the United Nations level in order \r\nto bring the Organization into line with the realities of \r\na plural and multipolar world. Taking that into account \r\nwill undoubtedly broaden the basis of the legitimacy \r\nand effectiveness of the United Nations in the world.\r\nUnited Nations reform is less a wish than a logical \r\nnecessity. The world has evolved; new problems and \r\nactors have emerged; the planet itself is now suffering; \r\nviolent extremism and terrorism threaten the world; \r\nand new forms of responsibility have emerged. As a \r\ncentre for the exercise of collective responsibility on \r\na global scale, the United Nations must update the \r\nway in which it is organized and functions if it is to \r\neffectively play its role as an institution in the service \r\nof the human community. The time has come, in the \r\nwords of the philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, for \r\na paradigm shift.\r\nI would like to reiterate my country’s support for and \r\ncommitment to the Secretary-General’s initiative for the \r\nfar-reaching reform of the Organization, which has the \r\nmerit of being based on an open and inclusive process \r\nthat takes into account the three main institutional \r\npillars of the United Nations system: peace and \r\nsecurity, development and the management structure. \r\nThe reform initiative is focused on restructuring the \r\npeace and security pillar, which will help to make the \r\ninstitution more pragmatic and effective.\r\nThe link between peace, security and development \r\nis well established. Without peace and security, there \r\ncan be no sustainable development, nor development of \r\nany kind nor the building of resilient and sustainable \r\nsocieties. The new United Nations peace and security \r\narchitecture must therefore be intrinsically linked to the \r\nbroader development pillar, which includes respect for \r\nand promotion of human rights and the strengthening \r\nof humanitarian action. The ongoing reform should \r\nreposition the United Nations development system to \r\nadapt it to the new requirements associated with the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment in order ultimately to achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals and push back the \r\nboundaries of objective poverty and domestic and \r\nglobal inequality.\r\nThe United Nations must do more to help address \r\nthe world’s lack of development. One more step in the \r\nwar on the development deficit will help our world to \r\nlift entire segments of the world’s population out of the \r\nmisery of their position and condition, and restore their \r\nautonomy and power of control over their own lives. \r\nThe Organization’s new development system must \r\naccommodate the need to build a world in which each \r\ncountry enjoys sustained, inclusive and sustainable \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 59/61\r\neconomic growth. The aim is to reorient the system with \r\nsignificant adjustments focusing on skills, leadership, \r\ncoordination and accountability mechanisms.\r\nThis new restructuring of development mechanisms \r\nmust also aim at the implementation of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. The challenges of \r\nclimate change are vital, and our response must not \r\nwait. Obviously, in our response to the challenges of \r\nclimate change, a significant place must be given to the \r\npromotion of partnerships and innovative mechanisms \r\nfor financing development, in accordance with the \r\nAddis Ababa Action Agenda.\r\nWith regard to the management pillar of the \r\nongoing reform, we are pleased to note that the \r\nmajor changes envisaged correspond to the need to \r\nimprove the Organization’s internal management \r\nmethods by simplifying procedures, decentralizing \r\naction and investing in people in order to better meet \r\nthe requirements of sustainable development and for \r\nbuilding a peaceful world. Investing in people means \r\ntaking a stand for development and peace in the world. \r\nIn short, the reform we are talking about today aims to \r\nmake the United Nations more dynamic and capable. \r\nThe current global challenges call for the strengthening \r\nof the operational capabilities of the United Nations.\r\nThe challenges facing Africa today are immense. \r\nOur continent continues to face new forms of crises \r\nand difficulties. Unfortunately, Africa is now home \r\nto hotbeds of terrorism in some of its regions and \r\ncountries, where people who legitimately aspire to \r\npeace of mind face daily acts of barbarism that feed on \r\nviolent extremism, religious ignorance and intolerance, \r\nand ideological fanaticism.\r\nPoverty persists in Africa, and African populations \r\nare seeking well-being. The consequences of climate \r\nchange are terrible, and migration is decimating a \r\nsignificant part of Africa’s young people and making \r\nthem vulnerable. The current challenges relating to the \r\ndifficult issue of migration and the human tragedies \r\nit generates appeal to our conscience and sense of \r\ncollective responsibility and call for appropriate and \r\nsustainable responses. In that regard, the Togolese \r\nGovernment urges all stakeholders to give priority to \r\nthe participatory approach and the logic of consensus \r\nin the ongoing negotiation process and to work with \r\ndetermination towards the adoption, at the Marrakech \r\nConference on 10 and 11 December 2018, of a global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration.\r\nThe General Assembly will certainly agree with me \r\nthat the emergence of the peaceful, equitable, prosperous \r\nand sustainable societies that we all want cannot become \r\na tangible reality unless priority is given to effective, \r\ninnovative and mutually beneficial partnership \r\nmechanisms. To that end, the United Nations should, \r\nin order to play its full coordinating role, rely more on \r\nregional and subregional organizations in the fields of \r\ninternational peace and security and development.\r\nIn the case of Africa, where development problems \r\nare acute, Governments have become aware of the need \r\nto accelerate the regional integration process in order \r\nto pool development efforts and poverty-reduction \r\nstrategies, as recommended under the African Union’s \r\nAgenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. Several initiatives are currently under way \r\nto further strengthen that integration. In that regard, \r\nTogo welcomes the appointment of its President, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé, by his \r\npeers to lead the project to establish the Single African \r\nAir Transport Market, which is an important instrument \r\nfor the continent’s economic integration. The effort \r\nto mobilize States to sign that solemn undertaking is \r\nongoing, with a view to creating such a market.\r\nOn the issue of international peace and security, \r\nour priority today is to strengthen international \r\ncooperation in peacekeeping operations and in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism. We must redouble our efforts to end \r\nconflicts, especially in Africa and many other parts of \r\nthe world. This is an opportunity to pay tribute to, and \r\nacknowledge the true value of, the leading role that the \r\nUnited Nations has always played in the world through \r\nits various peacekeeping missions, the majority of \r\nwhich, unfortunately, involve the African continent.\r\nIt is my pleasure to welcome in passing the Peace \r\nAgreement reached between the parties to the crisis \r\nin South Sudan and to plead for the implementation of \r\nthe commitments made for a political and definitive \r\nsolution to the ongoing conflict in that country. As \r\na member of the African Union Peace and Security \r\nCouncil, we believe that further cooperation between \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping structures and the \r\noperational mechanisms of the African Union and the \r\nsubregions is an urgent necessity.\r\nThe resolution adopted by the General Assembly \r\nlast June during the biennial review of the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy reminds us \r\nof that imperative (resolution 72/284). In that regard, \r\nthe Togolese Government welcomes the holding of the \r\nA/73/PV.11 27/09/2018\r\n60/61 18-30073\r\nfirst Joint Summit of Heads of State and Government \r\nof the Economic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS) and the Economic Community of Central \r\nAfrican States on Peace, Security, Stability and the Fight \r\nagainst Terrorism and Violent Extremism, in Lomé, \r\non 30 July, during Togo’s term as Chairman-in-Office \r\nof the Assembly of Heads of State and Government \r\nof ECOWAS. That meeting, the first of its kind on \r\nthe continent, organized at the initiative of the two \r\nsubregions, made it possible to create a framework for \r\nexchanges on preventive and operational conditions for \r\nthe preservation and maintenance of a lasting peace in \r\nthe common space of the two communities.\r\nIn order for the United Nations to assert its \r\nleadership and play its role effectively and fully as a \r\nguarantor of international peace and stability, it is \r\nessential to continue and complete the Security Council \r\nreform process. The reform of the Organization will \r\nbe complete only if it also involves the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. The new approach is based on a shared \r\nvision of responsibilities and recommends that solutions \r\nto international peace and security problems should be \r\nthe prerogative of all States Members of the United \r\nNations. In that way, the expanded Security Council \r\nwould, in the interest of equitable representation and \r\nthe involvement of all regions of the world, contribute \r\nto making the Council more effective in fulfilling its \r\nimportant mission. Although my country welcomes \r\nthe consultations held throughout this year, which \r\nhave enabled States and groups to make proposals \r\nand enrich the discussions, there is reason to wonder \r\nabout the outcome of the negotiation process, which has \r\nobviously been stalled for 28 years.\r\nAt the national level, Togo’s action is part of \r\nthe shared commitment of States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to the achievement of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. The Government’s main objective \r\nis to make Togo a middle-income country that is \r\neconomically, socially and democratically stable and \r\nopen to the world’s demands. The recently adopted \r\nnational development programme, which is consistent \r\nwith the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nECOWAS Vision 2020 and the African Union’s Agenda \r\n2063, aims to structurally transform the national \r\neconomy for sustainable, inclusive and resilient \r\ngrowth. Togo is working to improve the quality of life \r\nof its citizens and to contribute, alongside the United \r\nNations, to reducing pockets of insecurity in our \r\nchanging world. In that regard, I would like to express \r\nmy gratitude to the development partners that have \r\nalready come forward to support my country in that \r\nambitious and burdensome task.\r\nSustainable development also promotes the \r\ndevelopment of human rights. The establishment \r\nof a fair and free society depends on the building of \r\na peaceful and secure world. In that regard, Togo is \r\nresolutely pursuing its constitutional and institutional \r\nreform process with a view to consolidating democratic \r\ngains and guaranteeing rights and freedoms for all. In \r\nthat perspective, the Government has launched efforts \r\nto find a definitive and lasting solution to the political \r\nmisunderstandings that we have experienced in recent \r\nmonths, by continuing to bring together the political \r\nclass and civil society to share views on the common \r\nchallenges and objectives of peace and social and \r\nhuman progress.\r\nIn the spirit of regional solidarity, ECOWAS \r\nhas been helping Togo to overcome its political \r\ndifficulties. That noble regional organization, through \r\nthe facilitation of Ghana and Guinea, has helped the \r\nTogolese political class agree on the joint composition \r\nof the Independent National Electoral Commission with \r\na view to the scheduled holding of legislative elections \r\non 20 December 2018.\r\nThe late former Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations, Kofi Annan, who passed away last month and \r\nto whom we pay a well-deserved and grateful tribute \r\nfor his admirable commitment to the service of peace in \r\nthe world, said on 24 September 2001: “The only route \r\nthat offers any hope of a better future for all humanity \r\nis that of cooperation and partnership” (A/56/PV.7, p. 2). \r\nTogether we will be able to build the world that we want \r\nto leave to future generations.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish \r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind \r\nmembers that statements in exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first statement \r\nand to five minutes for the second, and should be made \r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Mamdouhi (Islamic Republic of Iran): \r\nIn the exercise of its right of reply, my delegation \r\nwishes to respond to the statement made today by the \r\nrepresentative of the Israeli regime.\r\nThe Israeli regime has a long history of pursuing \r\nopportunistic policies aimed at misleading others. \r\n27/09/2018 A/73/PV.11\r\n18-30073 61/61\r\nThe intention behind such behaviour, which consists \r\nof psychological projection, is to divert attention from \r\nthe regime’s inhuman and savage actions taken against \r\nPalestinians and other Arab nations. Those actions \r\nhave sowed instability and anger in the region, have \r\ncaused many crises and have brought much suffering. \r\nThe Israeli regime continues to be the leading spoiler \r\nof peace and stability in the volatile region that is the \r\nMiddle East.\r\nThe Israeli showman never misses an opportunity \r\nto launch accusations against Iran in particular. The \r\nfallacies in his statement confirm his pathological \r\ntendency to tell monstrous lies and distort reality. \r\nHe just wants to distract attention from his regime’s \r\ninherent cruelty and brutality against Palestinians. He \r\nwants to cover up the killing of defenceless women \r\nand innocent children. He wants to hide the fact that, \r\nfor decades, millions of Palestinians have been taken \r\nhostage by Israel. He wants to mask Israel’s face as the \r\nlast apartheid regime in the world. He wants to conceal \r\nthe reality that his is the only regime in the world that \r\nopenly practices racism, having recently legalized it.\r\nIsrael, the warden of the world’s biggest open \r\nprison, Gaza, dares to stand here once again and make \r\na statement filled with despicable lies. No matter \r\nhow many slurs, lies and fabrications the regime puts \r\nforward, it cannot hide Israel’s criminal nature. Theirs \r\nis a dreadfully regressive and undemocratic regime \r\nled by a corrupt leader who pretends to be progressive \r\nand democratic.\r\nThe Israeli Prime Minister’s ethnoreligious \r\nfantasies are indeed very similar to those of other \r\nextremists, in particular Da’esh. Israel’s absurd claim \r\nthat it is a democracy echoes similar assertions that the \r\nNazis used to make before dragging the world towards \r\ndestruction. A racist and supremacist democracy that \r\ncrushes the dreams of the true owners of Palestine for \r\nself-determination is a mockery of democracy. It is the \r\ntyranny of racists.\r\nIn fact, Israel is the enemy of democracy in the \r\nMiddle East. It hates democracy. Indeed, if democracy \r\nwere to prevail, there would be no room for Israel in \r\nthe Middle East. The Israeli regime rejects the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations in its practices and \r\npolicies, defies almost all United Nations resolutions \r\nand misuses the Assembly to mislead others. For \r\nexample, we should ask how many Security Council \r\nresolutions have been violated by Israel. It has violated \r\nsome 300 resolutions, on topics ranging from weapons \r\nof mass destruction to the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East.\r\nOn Israeli-Palestinian issues alone, Israel has \r\nviolated 225 Security Council resolutions. The latest \r\nof those resolutions was resolution 2334 (2016), which \r\ncalled for an end to Israeli settlement-building. At the \r\nCouncil meeting on 20 September, almost all of its \r\nmembers — with the exception, of course, of Israel’s \r\ngreat patron, the United States — urged Israel to \r\nrefrain from violating and defying that resolution (see \r\nS/PV.8358). Israel holds the record for ignoring the \r\ngreatest number of Security Council resolutions of any \r\ncountry, which symbolically makes it an international \r\noutlaw. In order to be able to do so, it relies mainly on \r\nthe United States, which has used its veto power a total \r\nof 44 times to shield Israel from Security Council draft \r\nresolutions against its practices.\r\nExhibiting some photographs from Google Street \r\nView today, the Israeli showman claimed that he had \r\ndiscovered new nuclear facilities in Iran. This is yet \r\nanother fabrication, which is not surprising, since lying \r\nis in his DNA. Instead of such fabrications, he should \r\nstop threatening Iran with nuclear annihilation, as he \r\ndid recently. Such an inflammatory statement against a \r\nparty to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) constitutes a serious violation of \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nGiven that the Israeli regime has attacked two peaceful \r\nnuclear facilities in our region in the past, the Security \r\nCouncil should strongly condemn the threats by that \r\nregime to use nuclear weapons against Iran.\r\nIsrael should also be compelled to abandon its \r\nnuclear weapons, accede to the NPT without delay \r\nor preconditions, and place all of its nuclear facilities \r\nunder the full-scope safeguards of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency. The regime should stop its \r\ndestabilizing conduct, its frequent incitements directed \r\nagainst countries in the region, and its regular violation \r\nof Syrian and Lebanese airspace. It should also put an \r\nend to its air strikes against various targets in Syria. \r\nThose air strikes effectively serve as air support for \r\nterrorist groups.\r\nLet us be altogether clear: we are watching the \r\nIsraelis’ criminal behaviour whenever and wherever \r\nthey commit it. The time when Israel could strike its \r\nneighbours with impunity is past.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.10 p.m.\r\n"
