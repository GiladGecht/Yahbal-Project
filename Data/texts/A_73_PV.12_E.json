"United Nations A/73/PV.12\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n12th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 28 September 2018, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mrs. Gueguen \r\n(France), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ilir Meta, President of the Republic \r\nof Albania\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Albania.\r\nMr. Ilir Meta, President of the Republic of Albania, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ilir Meta, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Albania, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Meta: Let me first join all the other \r\nspeakers in congratulating and wishing success to \r\nPresident Espinosa Garcés. Albania wishes to assure \r\nher of our full support in her tasks and mission.\r\nThe theme of this general debate, “Making the \r\nUnited Nations relevant to all people”, takes us to \r\nthe heart of multilateralism, the kind that our nations \r\nhave built through global leadership and shared \r\nresponsibilities for the benefit of peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies. While we share the belief \r\nin the need for the constant pursuit of reform, we \r\nremain faithful to the fundamental principles of the \r\nOrganization. We continue to see the United Nations \r\nas a multilateral instrument through which peaceful \r\ninternational order is safeguarded.\r\nThe United Nations was created in a concert of \r\nsovereign wills that produced a corpus of rules and \r\ngood practices to guide our efforts to find global \r\nsolutions to global problems. The United Nations has \r\nno life of its own outside the will of its Members, nor \r\nis it immune to evolving changes and developments. \r\nThe United Nations has grown as the world has become \r\nmore global. The issues of democracy, human rights, \r\nsecurity, development, technological advances and \r\nthe worldwide web, the environment and many more \r\nincreasingly feature on the United Nations agenda, just \r\nas they dominate our domestic policies.\r\nAlbania takes seriously its responsibility to be \r\nactive in this debate and thereby add relevance to our \r\npart of the world. It is in that spirit that we fully support \r\nthe vision of Secretary-General Guterres for reform and \r\nthe achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nat the national, regional and international levels. We \r\nstrongly believe that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment is universal, because it is relevant and \r\napplicable to all the countries of the world. Albania has \r\ntaken a clear stance through a unanimous resolution \r\nadopted by the Albanian Parliament that expresses \r\nour firm commitment to implementing and achieving \r\nthose Goals.\r\nAlbania presented its national voluntary report in \r\nJuly, incorporating a combination of its European agenda \r\nobjectives with those of sustainable development. I \r\nwould like to emphasize that those strategic documents \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n18-30104 (E)\r\n*1830104*\r\n \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n2/61 18-30104\r\nare fully compatible and in line with our national \r\nstrategic project for European integration. Albania’s \r\nnational strategy for development and integration \r\nenshrines the same strategic vision and objectives for \r\ndevelopment — good governance, the rule of law, a \r\ncompetitive and sustainable economy and the promotion \r\nof, and respect for, human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms. As we look forward to a future decision to \r\nopen accession negotiations with the European Union \r\n(EU), we remain committed to progress, with domestic \r\nreforms in key areas.\r\nWe also consider the EU prerogative of open \r\nregional cooperation to be an indispensable policy. \r\nWith ongoing processes aimed at maintaining peace \r\nand integration in the Balkans, we believe that every \r\nbilateral achievement among our countries contributes \r\ndirectly to greater peace, security, stability and \r\neconomic development. We consider that the recently \r\nreached agreement between Greece and Macedonia \r\nhas the opportunity to become a historic achievement. \r\nWe have called on all political actors in Macedonia, \r\nincluding local Albanian leaders, to be actively engaged \r\nin ensuring the success of the referendum to be held \r\non 30 September and to support a vote in favour of \r\nthe agreement.\r\nNATO’s open-door policy towards the Western \r\nBalkans remains vital and will be decisive in anchoring \r\nthe region to the NATO security umbrella and ensuring \r\nresponsible local ownership. In that context, I strongly \r\nwelcome the recent messages that our strategic partners \r\nsent to Macedonian citizens. Those messages echo \r\ntheir determination to uphold the immense investment \r\nover the past two decades in establishing stability and \r\nsecurity in the Balkans. The combined commitment of \r\nboth NATO and the EU is the best guarantor for all the \r\ncountries and citizens in our region.\r\nThat positive momentum can also nurture further \r\nprogress in the EU-led dialogue between Kosovo and \r\nSerbia. The dialogue has entered its final stage and \r\nis expected to be concluded with a legally binding \r\nagreement on the comprehensive normalization of \r\nrelations between the two States. It is of paramount \r\nimportance that the expected agreement should embody \r\npositive energy while fostering the European values of \r\ninter-ethnic coexistence and harmony. It is extremely \r\nimportant that the agreement mark a breaking away \r\nfrom history and the past and improve the daily lives of \r\nthe peoples in both States.\r\nLet us bear in mind that for the Balkans, the \r\npast is notoriously linked to border changes, ethnic \r\ncleansing and violent massive displacements. However, \r\nover the past two decades, the region has undergone \r\na tremendous transformation, thanks to the support \r\nand involvement of the United Nations and the serious \r\npolitical, social and economic investments of the United \r\nStates of America and the EU. We call on and welcome \r\nevery effort on the part of the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to promote the international recognition \r\nof Kosovo and further support its membership in \r\nregional and international organizations. Based on the \r\nstability and positive developments in Kosovo, Albania \r\nsupports a reduction in the number of meetings held \r\nby the Security Council on the reports on the United \r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.\r\nAlbania fully supports a more effective United \r\nNations agenda through a more integrated peace and \r\nsecurity architecture, with peacekeeping operations \r\nas vital instruments and a f lagship activity of the \r\nUnited Nations. We support the recent Action for \r\nPeacekeeping initiative of the Secretary-General, and \r\nwe have endorsed the declaration on that initiative. \r\nAlbania fully supports Security Council resolution \r\n2242 (2015) and the substantively similar resolutions \r\nthat were adopted by the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council on the review of the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture (resolutions 70/262 and 2282 (2016)). We \r\nremain confident that Secretary-General Guterres \r\nwill keep up the momentum for a revitalized role for \r\nthe United Nations, with a special focus on peace and \r\nsecurity in the world. His platform for the revitalization \r\nof the United Nations is promising, and we support it. \r\nAllow me to note that more than 6,500 members of the \r\nAlbanian armed forces and civilians have participated \r\nin international peacekeeping operations since 1996. \r\nThey have contributed to operations in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Chad, South Sudan, Afghanistan and \r\nother countries. We have pledged to continue our \r\nmodest but steady contribution.\r\nAlbania has been aligned with all of the United \r\nNations initiatives aimed at fighting terrorism and has \r\nratified 12 of the 19 related United Nations conventions \r\nand protocols. Albania joined the immediate response \r\nas part of the global struggle against violent extremism \r\nand, notably, the Global Coalition against Daesh. As \r\na NATO member, we tripled our troop contribution to \r\nAfghanistan last year. Our contribution is a significant \r\npart of the collective efforts to fight illegal migration \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 3/61\r\nin the Mediterranean Sea. We are part of the NATO \r\nmaritime mission in the Aegean Sea and assist the \r\nEuropean Border and Coast Guard Agency in stopping \r\nmigrant smuggling. Albania believes that the protection \r\nof civilians, women and children is of crucial importance \r\nin peacekeeping operations, because the life of every \r\nperson is precious.\r\nWe welcome the growing attention to the role \r\nof regional organizations in security issues. In that \r\nconnection, we greatly appreciate and welcome the \r\nclose cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe European Union on the platform of the Common \r\nSecurity and Defence Policy. If we are to have a safer \r\nand more peaceful planet, concrete steps must be taken. \r\nIn that regard, Albania hails the progress that has \r\nbeen made under the leadership of the United States \r\nof America on the denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula and considers it a very positive step forward, \r\nnot only for that region but the entire planet.\r\nAnother issue of serious concern threatening \r\npeace and security is the ongoing conflict in Syria. \r\nWe support all the actions taken by the international \r\nactors to end the conflict and stop the use of chemical \r\nweapons. The humanitarian situation has worsened, and \r\nthat tragedy has produced millions of displaced persons \r\nand war refugees, which also threatens the security of \r\nneighbouring countries and the European continent.\r\nThe situation in Libya also continues to seriously \r\nconcern us, and we affirm our strong commitment to the \r\nunity and territorial integrity of Libya and emphasize \r\nthe need to de-escalate the violence there and combat \r\nthe spread of terrorism. We have supported the efforts \r\nof the international community to develop an inclusive \r\npolitical dialogue among all parties on the future of \r\nLibya as the only way to stop the conflict and resolve \r\nthe Libyan crisis, which is a seriously threatening \r\nsituation, and not only to its immediate neighbours.\r\nThe conflict between Israel and Palestine is still \r\nundermining peace and stability in the Middle East. A \r\ntwo-State solution will realistically enable both sides \r\nto fulfil their aspirations, put an end to the conflict \r\nand achieve a just and lasting peace for Israelis and \r\nPalestinians. We have always welcomed and supported \r\nthe efforts of all sides and those of the international \r\ncommunity to find a solution through negotiation.\r\nA few days ago, on behalf of Albania, I expressed, \r\nour full support for the principles and implementation \r\nof the declaration on the Global Call to Action on the \r\nWorld Drug Problem, initiated by the United States. \r\nWe all need to take bold action and work together to \r\neliminate drugs from the lives of our young people and \r\nchildren and save our societies and our national security \r\nand public health. For that reason, we must strengthen \r\ninternational cooperation and build a common basis \r\nof understanding of the problem, including taking \r\neffective measures against it. In that context, I would \r\nalso like to underline that Albania enjoys excellent \r\ncooperation with the United Nations Office on Drugs \r\nand Crime.\r\nAs a country with valuable contributions to the \r\nenforcement of peace, stability and progress, our \r\nrespect for and strong desire to protect universal \r\nhuman rights and our strong faith in multilateralism, \r\nAlbania seeks to serve as a non-permanent member of \r\nthe Security Council for the period from 2022 to 2023. \r\nTo that end, we stand ready to engage constructively in \r\nconflict prevention and various peace operations, both \r\nin the United Nations and in other regional security \r\norganizations, in order to implement sustainable \r\ndevelopment policies and contribute to universal \r\nrespect for human rights. Albania is committed to \r\nprotecting and promoting all human rights and supports \r\nthe integration of the human rights dimension into the \r\nagenda of United Nations.\r\nFinally, I would like to address the issue of climate \r\nchange, which affects every country and continent. It is \r\ndisrupting national economies and affecting lives, at a \r\nhigh cost to peoples, communities and countries. The \r\nhistoric Paris Agreement on Climate Change of 2015, \r\nwhich is based on the Kyoto Protocol to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nprovides a legally binding international commitment \r\nto engaging with concrete action. Albania has adopted \r\ncorresponding strategies and action plans and is taking \r\nthe necessary measures to protect the environment \r\nand reduce gas emissions. It is quite clear that the \r\nconsequences of climate change are moving faster \r\nthan we are. We must prevent climate change in order \r\nto ensure the existence of the planet and save future \r\ngenerations. Collective efforts are needed to address \r\ncollective challenges.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Albania for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n4/61 18-30104\r\nMr. Ilir Meta, President of the Republic of Albania, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Carl Greenidge, Vice-President \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nCo-operative Republic of Guyana\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Vice-President \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Co-operative \r\nRepublic of Guyana.\r\nMr. Carl Greenidge, Vice-President and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Co-operative Republic of \r\nGuyana, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Carl \r\nGreenidge, Vice-President and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Greenidge (Guyana): I am pleased to extend \r\nour warmest congratulations to Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés and the people of Ecuador on the \r\noccasion of her election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session. That election is \r\nall the more gratifying because Ms. Espinosa Garcés \r\nrepresents the Latin America and Caribbean region. \r\nShe joins a small but distinguished group of women \r\nwho have presided over the Assembly in the 72 years of \r\nits history. Guyana pledges its unwavering support as \r\nshe discharges her responsibilities.\r\nLet me also take the opportunity to pay tribute to \r\nthe previous President, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák, for his successful stewardship of the Assembly’s \r\nseventy-second session.\r\nI would also like to take a moment to salute the \r\nmemory of the late former Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan, a son of Africa and a servant of the peoples of \r\nthe world whose dedication to the global community \r\nwas epitomized by a lifetime of self less service to the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nGuyana is guided by the value of multilateralism, \r\nsometimes termed liberal multilateralism, which has \r\noriented its policies since independence. That rules-\r\nbased system, with a pivotal role for nation States \r\nalongside key international and multilateral institutions, \r\nis valued by Member States, particularly small States. \r\nIt is largely predictable, as it is based on the rule of law, \r\nand it has enabled extensive economic development and \r\nimprovements in human welfare across the globe since \r\nits establishment after the 1939-1945 war.\r\nIn spite of that success, multilateralism is now \r\nunder attack in some quarters of the world, and recently \r\nthere have even been calls for it to be replaced. Some \r\nof the challenges fuelling such calls are obvious. The \r\nrapid expansion in the number of States over the past \r\nfew decades has contributed to the exponential growth \r\nin the number and complexity of decision-making units \r\nin the system. The consequences of the latter have been \r\nmost evident in some of the very areas in which global \r\nmultilateral governance has had the greatest success in \r\nthe past — trade, economic growth and the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts.\r\nAt the United Nations, we are faced with stymied \r\nefforts at Security Council reform. The debates about \r\nthe reforms needed to move us forward and out of \r\nthis cul-de-sac have yielded many ideas. But rather \r\nthan turning to outdated models, solutions based on \r\nmisconceived economic goals, or some form of national \r\nexceptionalism, we need to explore complementary \r\norganizational forms and arrangements that could help \r\nsimplify decision-making.\r\nIn their attempts to look outside the box for \r\nsolutions, some observers have turned to the idea of \r\nincluding new partners, such as non-governmental \r\norganizations and social networks working alongside \r\nStates and Governments, as well as to some degree of \r\nregionalization of organizational structures — the so-\r\ncalled Web 2.0 option. It may also be worth exploring \r\nother voting rules for decision-making. In other words, \r\nwe need to fashion a more equitable and just variant of \r\nmultilateralism rather than its replacement.\r\nSerious proposals should seek to preserve the \r\nvalued elements of multilateralism, because as we face \r\nmore intractable problems, the capacities of individual \r\nStates do not give us the ability to solve those problems. \r\nIt is no wonder that the Secretary-General, in his report \r\non the work of the Organization (A/73/1), asserts that \r\nthe United Nations offers a platform where Member \r\nStates, regional organizations and civil society can \r\nfind solutions to global problems that no nation can \r\nresolve by acting alone. Working together is not an \r\noption. It is the only answer. Guyana therefore pledges \r\nits full support for the strategic vision proposed by \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 5/61\r\nthe President, “Dialogue and the strengthening of \r\nmultilateralism as a catalyst for the well-being of all \r\npersons and a sustainable planet”.\r\nGlobal governance and peace are inextricably \r\nlinked. In that regard, Guyana has noted with \r\nsatisfaction the efforts of Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres, in close collaboration with Member States, \r\nto reform and streamline the machinery of the United \r\nNations so as to make it more fit for purpose. We fully \r\nsupport the reform of the peace and security pillar, with \r\nits emphasis on preventive diplomacy.\r\nPeace is also inextricably linked to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In that regard, the United Nations \r\ndisarmament agenda is a central element in our efforts \r\nto achieve a stable, secure and peaceful world order. \r\nGuyana has demonstrated its commitment to that \r\nagenda, most recently in its signing and ratification \r\nof the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. \r\nWe recognize, however, that the commitment of every \r\nMember State to the disarmament agenda is key to \r\nachieving the world to which we aspire. The onus is on \r\nall of us to fulfil the obligations that we have taken on \r\nourselves by becoming State parties to the various legal \r\ninstruments concerned with questions of disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation.\r\nFor Guyana and the wider Caribbean, the illicit trade \r\nin small arms and light weapons and their associated \r\nammunition poses one of the most serious threats to \r\nhuman security and sustainable development in our \r\nregion. International drug trafficking, transnational \r\norganized crime, unregulated cyberspace and the illicit \r\ntrade in small arms and light weapons divert resources \r\nthat could otherwise be invested in other critical areas. \r\nWe believe that with effective international cooperation \r\nand assistance, small countries like Guyana can tackle \r\nthat illicit trade and ultimately create safer communities, \r\ncountries and regions and a safer world.\r\nAdherence to the cardinal principles of the sovereign \r\nequality of States, respect for the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of States and the peaceful resolution \r\nof disputes are the most effective guarantees of peace. \r\nMembers are no doubt aware of the controversy that has \r\narisen between Guyana and its neighbour the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela over Venezuela’s contention that \r\nthe 1899 arbitral award, which settled the boundaries \r\nbetween the two countries, is null and void.\r\nOn 30 January 2018, Secretary-General Guterres \r\ntook the decision that the controversy with the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela should be referred to \r\nthe International Court of Justice. The decision of the \r\nSecretary-General is binding on the parties. Accordingly, \r\nin March of this year, Guyana filed its application in \r\nthe Court, seeking an affirmation of the validity of the \r\n1899 arbitral award and the international boundary \r\nthat it established. Unfortunately, notwithstanding its \r\nobligation to do so, Venezuela has so far refused to \r\nparticipate in the proceedings. Guyana sincerely hopes \r\nthat Venezuela will change its mind. There is still time \r\nfor it to do so. Guyana wishes to express its gratitude \r\nto the Secretary-General for his important contribution \r\nto the resolution of this long-standing matter and looks \r\nforward to a final judgment by the International Court \r\nof Justice.\r\nAs a responsible member of the global community, \r\nGuyana seeks peace not only in our region but throughout \r\nthe world where the scourges of war and conflict are \r\nan obstacle to development. They divert attention away \r\nfrom the pressing problems of development and the \r\nenhancement of human well-being.\r\n With regard to the Middle East, the region of the \r\nworld that has given birth to thethree great monotheistic \r\nreligions of our age, we reiterate our call for a two-\r\nState solution to the generational conflict between \r\nthe peoples of Palestine and Israel. Those two peoples \r\nhave much to gain by living side by side in peace. Like \r\npeople everywhere, the people of Palestine, including \r\nthe inhabitants of Gaza, have a right to life, a dignified \r\nexistence and their own homeland.\r\nSimilarly, we deplore the suffering being endured \r\nby the Rohingya population. We call on the international \r\ncommunity to take the necessary steps to ensure respect \r\nfor the human rights of the affected population. At the \r\nsame time, we commend the efforts of Bangladesh to \r\nprovide a safe haven for the refugee population, with \r\nthe assistance of international agencies.\r\nCloser to home, in the Caribbean region, we again \r\njoin the overwhelming majority of the international \r\ncommunity in calling for the removal of the trade and \r\neconomic embargo on our sister Caribbean nation of \r\nCuba. That embargo hinders the right of the Cuban \r\npeople to development and the enhancement of their \r\nmaterial well-being.\r\nGuyana also welcomes the measures being taken to \r\nreposition the United Nations development system in \r\norder to better align its operations with the goals set out \r\nin the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n6/61 18-30104\r\naccept that that repositioning is a shared responsibility, \r\nand Guyana is committed to playing its part. Guyana \r\nhas fully embraced the holistic and people-centred \r\napproach to development enshrined in the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Our nation is currently engaged \r\nin efforts to mainstream and integrate those Goals into \r\nour national development strategy, known as the Green \r\nState Development Strategy, which seeks to ensure \r\nthat development is not achieved at the expense of the \r\nenvironment, notwithstanding the fact that Guyana \r\nwill soon become a significant oil producer, regionally \r\nand internationally. We will wean Guyana away from \r\nits current near-total dependence on non-renewable \r\nsources of energy. We are turning to renewable sources \r\nsuch as hydroelectricity, wind, solar and biomass.\r\nGuyana is unalterably committed to the principles \r\nof sustainable development and to working with the \r\ninternational community and all partners to help \r\ncombat the effects of climate change, including rising \r\nsea levels, to which we are particularly vulnerable as \r\na low-lying coastal State. For that reason, Guyana’s \r\nstrategy is to emphasize inclusive transformation, \r\nsustainable natural resources, energy transition, \r\nresilient infrastructure, human development and well-\r\nbeing, Government and institutional foundations and \r\ninternational cooperation, trade and investment.\r\nGuyana fully recognizes the necessary — nay, \r\ncritical — contribution of women and girls to its \r\nsustainable development. Women and girls constitute \r\nmore than half of the world’s population. The \r\nunderutilization of their potential represents a serious \r\nloss of resources in the global effort to promote \r\nhuman development. We are trying to ensure that the \r\nmanagement of that development is undertaken with \r\nwomen and girls fully represented at the helm of the \r\ndecision-making in Guyana. We therefore applaud the \r\nsteps taken by the Secretary-General to ensure parity in \r\nthe appointment of United Nations senior management, \r\nincluding Resident Coordinators in the field.\r\nI want to express Guyana’s satisfaction at the \r\nsuccessful conclusion this year of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on a global compact for safe, orderly and \r\nregular migration. Its provisions are consistent with the \r\n2030 Agenda and the commitments made in the New \r\nYork Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. It is our \r\nhope that this global framework will help to manage \r\ninternational migration f lows in all their dimensions \r\nfor the benefit of all States, both of origin and \r\ndestination, and for the benefit of migrants themselves. \r\nGuyana looks forward to the successful adoption of the \r\ncompact at the Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt \r\nthe Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular \r\nMigration, to be held in December in Marrakech.\r\nWe meet this year in disconcerting times. Our \r\nplanet, the only one we have, faces grave threats on \r\nmultiple fronts, including to the very existence of life \r\nas we know it. As I have already hinted, there are many \r\nwho question whether our Organization, the nations \r\nof the world united, will be able to unite our strength \r\nin order to maintain international peace and security \r\nwhile promoting social progress and better standards \r\nof living in larger freedom and reaffirming faith in \r\nfundamental human rights, the dignity and worth of the \r\nhuman person and the equal rights of men and women. \r\nIt is for us to decide and to summon the will to work \r\nfor those ends. Our children and our children’s children \r\nwill judge us. Guyana reaffirms its strong resolution \r\nto doing its part within the limits of its capacity \r\nand resources.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nCo-operative Republic of Guyana for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Carl Greenidge, Vice-President and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Cooperative Republic of \r\nGuyana, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Taban Deng Gai, First \r\nVice-President of the Republic of South Sudan\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the First \r\nVice-President of the Republic of South Sudan.\r\nMr. Taban Deng Gai, First Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of South Sudan, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Taban Deng \r\nGai, First Vice-President of the Republic of South \r\nSudan, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Gai (South Sudan): It is my great honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of His Excellency \r\nMr. Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the Republic \r\nof South Sudan, who unfortunately could not be here \r\ntoday owing to his engagement in consolidating and \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 7/61\r\nstreamlining the implementation of the peace process. \r\nI would also like to congratulate the President on her \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-third session and on being the fourth woman \r\nto hold that position. The Republic of South Sudan \r\naffirms its commitment to playing its role in supporting \r\nthe implementation of the agenda she has proposed for \r\nthis historic session.\r\nOn behalf of the people of the Republic of South \r\nSudan and my Government, I would like to reiterate \r\nour heartfelt condolences to the entire United Nations \r\nfamily and to the family of the late former Secretary-\r\nGeneral His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, who recently \r\npassed away. He played a crucial role in supporting the \r\npeople of the Republic of South Sudan by ensuring that \r\nwe  peace, which was instrumental in the formation of \r\nthe Republic of South Sudan.\r\nIn addition, I was happy to attend the centenary \r\ncommemoration of the late Madiba (see A/73/PV.4 et \r\nseq.). It is fitting that the United Nations has dedicated \r\n24 September to the annual holding of the Nelson \r\nMandela Peace Summit. He was an icon of peace whose \r\nlegacy will live forever.\r\nThe theme selected by the President for this \r\nsession, “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”, resonates \r\nvery well with the vision of the Republic of South Sudan \r\nfor peace and prosperity. At this juncture, I would like \r\nto share with members some of the successes that we \r\nhave achieved on our long walk to peace and prosperity.\r\nI stood before the General Assembly last year (see \r\nA/72/PV.19) as the First Vice-President of a country \r\nin the middle of violent conflict. I stand before the \r\nAssembly today in testament to what Members of \r\nthis Organization have helped achieve in the Republic \r\nof South Sudan, especially the relevant specialized \r\nUnited Nations bodies operating in our country, along \r\nwith the Intergovernmental Authority on Development \r\n(IGAD), the African Union (AU), the European Union, \r\nthe Troika, China, the IGAD Partners Forum and the \r\ninternational partners and friends of South Sudan. I \r\nam pleased to inform the Assembly that we now have a \r\nmore united Republic of South Sudan, heading towards \r\npeaceful stability. With the continued support and \r\ngoodwill of our regional and international partners, we \r\nare on schedule to hold free and fair general elections \r\nafter a transitional period of 36 months.\r\nThe path leading towards that agreement began at \r\nthe thirty-first Extraordinary Summit of IGAD Heads \r\nof State and Government, held on 12 June 2017 in Addis \r\nAbaba on the situation in the Republic of South Sudan. \r\nThe Heads of State and Government agreed on the need \r\nfor the establishment of a high-level revitalization forum \r\nfor all of the parties to the Agreement on the Resolution \r\nof the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. That \r\nprocess includes new stakeholders and various groups, \r\nincluding civil society, women’s groups, religious \r\nleaders, young people and eminent persons as observers. \r\nThe purpose of the High-level Revitalization Forum, \r\nas stated at the Extraordinary Summit, was threefold: \r\nfirst, to institute a permanent ceasefire; secondly, to \r\ngive fresh impetus to the inclusive implementation of \r\nthe provisions of the peace agreement; and thirdly, to \r\nagree on a realistic new timeline and implementation \r\nschedule for the holding of democratic elections at the \r\nend of the transitional period.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of South Sudan \r\nunreservedly embraced the IGAD-led High-level \r\nRevitalization Forum. Its objectives were crystal clear, \r\nand the delegation of the Government of the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan attended the meetings of the Forum fully \r\nprepared to take advantage of every opportunity to \r\nachieve comprehensive and lasting peace. The thirty-\r\nsecond Extraordinary Summit of IGAD Heads of State \r\nand Government on the situation in the Republic of South \r\nSudan entrusted His Excellency Field Marshal Omer \r\nHassan Ahmed Al-Bashir, President of the Republic of \r\nthe Sudan, to facilitate a second round of face-to-face \r\ndiscussions with His Excellency General Salva Kiir \r\nMayardit, Mr. Riek Machar and other political leaders \r\nto resolve the outstanding issues pertaining to the \r\ngovernance and security arrangements emerging from \r\nthe Revitalization Forum.\r\nThe signing of the Khartoum Declaration of \r\nAgreement between the Parties to the Conflict in the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan took place on 27 June. General \r\nSalva Kiir Mayardit and Mr. Riek Machar, together with \r\nother political leaders, approved under that agreement: \r\nfirst, the declaration of a permanent ceasefire throughout \r\nSouth Sudan, based on the Cessation of Hostilities \r\nAgreement signed on 21 December 2017; secondly, \r\nthe adoption of security arrangements to build one \r\nnational army, a police force and other security organs \r\nof an inclusive character; and thirdly, the conclusion \r\nof an agreement on the revised bridging proposal \r\nbefore the closure of the Khartoum round of talks. On \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n8/61 18-30104\r\n12 September, all of the parties — the Transitional \r\nGovernment of National Unity, the Sudanese People’s \r\nLiberation Movement/Sudanese People’s Liberation \r\nArmy in Opposition, the South Sudan Opposition \r\nAlliance, former detainees, other political parties and \r\nother stakeholders with regard to the original peace \r\nAgreement — signed the final Revitalized Agreement \r\non the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic \r\nof South Sudan in Addis Ababa. The signing was \r\ngraciously attended and witnessed by the IGAD Heads \r\nof State and Government, the international community, \r\nthe African Union, the European Union, the United \r\nNations, the Troika, China, the IGAD Partners Forum \r\nand international partners and friends of the Republic \r\nof South Sudan.\r\nIn addition to the recently signed Revitalized \r\nPeace Agreement, since December 2015 we have \r\nbeen working on a national dialogue and grass-roots \r\npeople-to-people peace initiatives. It is our belief that \r\nsuch a complementary three-track approach is the only \r\nway to consolidate the efforts for peace on the ground, \r\nas well as to ensure the restoration of accountability \r\nand the upholding of human rights in my country. In \r\nSouth Sudan’s unique environment, a multilayered \r\napproach such as the one adopted by my Government is \r\nthe best way forward.\r\nIt is therefore against that background that the \r\nTransitional Government of National Unity has \r\nembraced the full implementation of the peace \r\nAgreement as the only instrument crucial to achieving \r\nthat mission and vision. The Government of the Republic \r\nof South Sudan is ready to welcome forces from the \r\nguarantors of the Revitalized Agreement to monitor \r\nits implementation and encourages IGAD and the AU \r\nto discuss with the Security Council how the Regional \r\nProtection Force can help to monitor and ensure that \r\npeace holds in the Republic of South Sudan. With regard \r\nto security-sector reforms, which are a major pillar of \r\nthe Revitalized Agreement, my Government reiterates \r\nits commitment and resolve to implement transitional \r\nsecurity arrangements encompassing a range of \r\nsecurity-sector reforms, including the cantonment of \r\nforces. Moreover, the Government is committed to \r\ntransforming the Sudan Peoples’ Liberation Army, and \r\nits structures are already in place to achieve the aim of \r\ncreating a professional national army.\r\nI am very pleased to inform the Assembly of the \r\nformation of the National Pre-Transitional Committee, \r\nwhich is made up of all of the stakeholders who will \r\nbe entrusted with the functions of overseeing and \r\ncoordinating the implementation of the peace agreement \r\nactivities during the pretransitional period.\r\nThe achievement of lasting peace requires \r\nestablishing mechanisms to tackle impunity and ensure \r\naccountability. In the recently decided Terrain Hotel \r\ncase, the Government interviewed victims in order to be \r\nable to hold the responsible individuals accountable. A \r\ndetailed investigation formula and evidence-gathering \r\nprocess, carried out with the support of the United \r\nStates Government through the Federal Bureau of \r\nInvestigation, enabled the victims to identify their \r\nattackers and enabled the prosecution of those \r\nresponsible to the full extent of the law. Since the \r\neruption of the conflict in December 2013, the court \r\nmartial has tried 204 cases, including the Terrain \r\nHotel case. The Terrain Hotel trials demonstrated \r\nthe commitment of the Sudanese People’s Liberation \r\nMovement/Sudanese People’s Liberation Army in \r\nOpposition to holding its members to account for their \r\ncrimes, including abuse of civilians.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nIt goes without saying that war has blighted the \r\neconomy of the Republic of South Sudan. We have seen \r\ntremendous losses of life, property and human dignity. \r\nNo report affects my heart as much as the sight of our \r\nyoung and infirm dying needlessly and suffering from \r\ndeprivation. Indeed, I have been asked specifically \r\nwhy my Government believes that this time peace is \r\npermanent. There is an African proverb that advises a \r\nperson to look at the place where he slipped, because \r\nthere he will find what made him fall.\r\nIt is through a change of leaders’ attitudes from \r\nentrenched positions that we have moved towards \r\na conciliatory and accommodating Government of \r\nNational Unity. My President, Mr. Kiir Mayardit, has \r\ncompromised on many positions and worked with \r\nmore stakeholders for the sake of peace. The IGAD-led \r\npeace initiatives have demonstrated the way in which \r\nAfrican solutions to African problems can lead to an \r\nagreement. I want to express my heartfelt appreciation \r\nto IGAD, the Republic of the Sudan in particular, and \r\nthe broader international community for the critical \r\nroles they played, without which the Revitalized Peace \r\nAgreement would not have happened.\r\nIn that regard, given the positive role being played \r\nby the Republic of the Sudan in the peace process in \r\nSouth Sudan and the region, we appeal for a speedy \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 9/61\r\nnormalization of the relationship between the Sudan \r\nand the United States of America. Moreover, we call \r\nfor the total lifting of the sanctions against the Sudan.\r\nWe urge the Government of the Sudan to find a \r\nspeedy resolution to the contentious issues in the Blue \r\nNile, Southern Kordofan and Darfur regions, based on \r\nour strong belief that stability in those areas is critical \r\nfor total and lasting peace in South Sudan and the \r\nSudan, as well as the region as a whole.\r\nOn Abyei, as we await the settlement of its final \r\nstatus, the Government of South Sudan reiterates its \r\nsupport for the recommendations of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his letter to the Security Council dated \r\n20 August (S/2018/776). We also commend the good \r\nwork of the United Nations Interim Security Force for \r\nAbyei (UNISFA) and remain grateful to Ethiopia, the \r\nsole UNISFA troop contributor.\r\nWe also urge Member States to continue supporting \r\nefforts at the level of the African Union to find a political \r\nsolution to the problem of Abyei. We call especially for \r\nthe implementation of the 21 September 2012 proposal \r\nof the AU High-Level Implementation Panel for the \r\nSudan and former President Mbeki, which has been \r\nendorsed more than six times to date by the AU Peace \r\nand Security Council. It is high time that we brought an \r\nend to the suffering of the Ngok Dinka people.\r\nConflict by itself can also be a vehicle for positive \r\nchange, if we are aware of where we have come from, \r\nwhere we are now and where we are going. As brothers \r\nand sisters, we have hurt each other. As we seek national \r\nhealing, President Kiir Mayardit has empowered \r\na cross-section of community representatives and \r\nmediators to set up national dialogue and other grass-\r\nroots people-to-people peace initiatives.\r\nThe national dialogue was launched to create a \r\nmultilayered approach to repairing the social fabric. It \r\nhas been heavily criticized by some external observers, \r\nmainly because of a misconception that it was considered \r\na substitute for peace talks. At the launch of the national \r\ndialogue in 2015, its aim was to create a forum in which \r\nthe causes of conflict could be discussed and, among \r\nother things, to ask the people important questions \r\nabout matters such as national identity, governance and \r\nthe relationship between the communities, including \r\nthe causes of intercommunal conflict.\r\nThe grass-roots component has been the most \r\neffective. Members of the committee visited regions, \r\nstarting at the community level, asking questions \r\ndesigned to identify the causes of division while also \r\nsearching for solutions to those divisions and how to \r\nheal them. The process enabled those who had not \r\nhad an opportunity to have their voices heard to begin \r\nexpressing their various viewpoints. The reports from \r\nthe grass-roots initiatives were candid, as communities \r\nwere allowed to express their opinions freely without \r\nfear of repercussions. We look forward to seeing the next \r\nsteps of that process as we enter the transitional period.\r\nAs we work to make the United Nations relevant \r\nto all people through global leadership and shared \r\nresponsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties, I would like to reiterate that my Government \r\nwelcomes the presence and support of United Nations \r\nagencies. However, the terms of that relationship need \r\nto be reconsidered, specifically when it comes to \r\nprotecting vulnerable citizens in the host country. It is \r\nonly through a reflective approach that we can move \r\nforward in adapting the nature of this institution to \r\nmake it fit for today’s environment.\r\nLast but not least, as I speak of reviving peace in \r\nthe Republic of South Sudan, it is only right to mention \r\nthe late former President John F. Kennedy, who said in \r\nan address to the Assembly on 20 September 1963:\r\n“Peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly process, \r\ngradually changing opinions, slowly eroding \r\nold barriers, quietly building new structures.” \r\n(A/PV.1209, para.38)\r\nI call on members of the United Nations family, \r\nincluding those who are sceptical, to give peace a \r\nchance in the Republic of South Sudan by supporting \r\nthe critical implementation phase of the peace \r\nagreement. South Sudan will continue its cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations, the regional bodies, IGAD, \r\nthe East African Community, the AU, the EU, the \r\nTroika, China, other international partners and all \r\nour friends as we work to enhance conditions in our \r\ncountry. We undertake to consolidate peace and justice, \r\nrebuild strong institutions in our country and stabilize \r\nour economy.\r\nWe call on all Member States as partners to \r\nsupport, cooperate, consult and engage in dialogue \r\nwith us as we join together in achieving the agenda \r\nfor making the United Nations relevant to all people \r\nthrough global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. That \r\nis our agenda, too.\r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n10/61 18-30104\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the First \r\nVice-President of the Republic of South Sudan for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Taban Dei Gei, First Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Boyko Borissov, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Bulgaria\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Bulgaria.\r\nMr. Boyko Borissov, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Bulgaria, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Boyko \r\nBorissov, Prime Minister of the Republic of Bulgaria, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Borissov (Bulgaria) (spoke in Bulgarian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I believe we \r\nshould appreciate the fact that the theme of this year’s \r\ngeneral debate deals with global leadership and shared \r\nresponsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties. It is comprehensive and provides food for \r\nthought on the direction in which our world should \r\ndevelop — and this international Organization along \r\nwith it.\r\nGlobal leadership is, first and foremost, a great \r\nresponsibility. In order for us to achieve sustainability \r\nand standards of living that uphold the principle \r\nof dignity for every human being on the planet, it is \r\nabsolutely crucial that we demonstrate our commitment \r\nand unity as we face the challenges of our time. I am \r\nconvinced that we are all aware that we need to act with \r\ndetermination and unity in sharing the responsibility \r\nto ensure peace, equality and the sustainability of \r\nour communities.\r\nThe Republic of Bulgaria has worked constantly \r\nand actively to sustain a world order based on the rule \r\nof law and to reaffirm the principles of multilateral \r\ncooperation. That is why I would like to highlight that \r\nit is the destiny of the United Nations to play a central \r\nrole in that effort, and we therefore actively support the \r\nOrganization in its efforts.\r\nThe main global challenges, such as conflict \r\nresolution and peacekeeping, strengthening global \r\nsecurity and stability, countering climate change, \r\nterrorism and ever-deepening inequality, cannot be \r\naddressed by one country alone. Those challenges require \r\nshared responsibility and everyone’s contribution.\r\nGlobal peace and security depend on the stability \r\nand sustainable development of the various parts of our \r\nglobalized world. Every country, large or small, has \r\nthe responsibility and capacity to make a significant \r\ncontribution to security and prosperity in the region in \r\nwhich it is located. For example, this past Monday, at the \r\nhigh-level event on the global drug problem organized \r\nby President Trump, every participating country made \r\na firm commitment to fighting that global scourge. It \r\nwas not by chance that Bulgaria was one of the co-hosts \r\nof that event. We have already pledged and proven our \r\ncommitment to fighting the drug problem through \r\nour actions. Even as we speak, Bulgarian customs \r\nauthorities and prosecutors have managed to seize \r\nhundreds of kilogrammes of drugs, making my country \r\na positive example. In order to achieve peace, security \r\nand stability, as well as the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, we all need to take more actions of that kind.\r\nThe United Nations plays an integral part in \r\npromoting the fair use of global opportunities for the \r\nbenefit of all. Inclusive and sustainable global growth \r\nunderpins the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. Achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, which are universal in nature and \r\nclosely interlinked, is the key to addressing our current \r\nglobal challenges.\r\nDuring the first half of this year, the Bulgarian \r\npresidency of the Council of the European Union (EU) \r\ninvested considerable efforts in achieving marked \r\nprogress and consensus among member States on the \r\nmain goals of the 2030 Agenda. We are proud that \r\nduring our six-month tenure of the presidency, the \r\nEuropean Union adopted a mandate to start negotiations \r\nfor the signing of a new partnership agreement with 79 \r\ncountries from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. \r\nThe negotiations seek to achieve a modern, dynamic \r\npartnership with those countries as an important \r\ninstrument in tackling global challenges, ranging from \r\npoverty and inequality to the promotion of peace and \r\nsustainable development for all.\r\nAllow me to highlight some of the idiosyncrasies of \r\nthe region in which my country, Bulgaria, is situated. \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 11/61\r\nThis year we mark the 100th anniversary of the end of \r\nthe First World War, which serves to remind us of the \r\nimportance of the Balkans in the past as well as the \r\nrelevance of the region in the present day. The Balkans \r\nhave often been the source of conflicts and to this day \r\nthe embers of some in that area continue to burn.\r\nDespite the circumstances and obstacles they face, \r\nthe countries of South-Eastern Europe, especially \r\nthose in the Western Balkans, have managed to make \r\nremarkable progress on important and much debated \r\nissues. It took several decades to reach the current \r\nstate of affairs, which is why we should not hesitate \r\nany further to offer the international community’s \r\nunequivocal political support to every State or initiative \r\nthat deserves support.\r\nCompelling proof of the progress made by the \r\nWestern Balkan countries can be seen in the recent \r\nsigning of agreements between Sofia and Skopje, \r\nas well as that between Athens and Skopje. Those \r\nagreements are crucial steps towards stability and \r\nsecurity in South-Eastern Europe and towards the Euro-\r\nAtlantic prospects of the Western Balkan countries. \r\nThe agreement between Podgorica and Pristina on \r\nthe border demarcation, which just came into force, is \r\nalso a significant milestone. Those documents not only \r\nshow but also help to create the new spirit of relations \r\nbetween and among the countries of that region.\r\nI will provide one more example. Based on the \r\nhistoric opportunity that the rotating presidency of \r\nthe Council of the EU offered us, Bulgaria initiated a \r\nprocess that put the Western Balkans back on the agenda \r\nof European politics. Opportunities for cooperation and \r\nthe participation of countries from outside the region in \r\nthe construction of the new Balkan infrastructure have \r\nalready started to attract interest and investments.\r\nAn important and emblematic expression of \r\nthat process was the Leaders’ Summit of the States \r\nmembers of the EU and the Western Balkan countries \r\nin our capital, Sofia, in May this year. That was the \r\nfirst meeting of its kind since the Thessaloniki Summit \r\nin 2003. Connectivity in all its dimensions was the \r\nfocus of the discussion, as was the joint response of \r\nthe young and relatively small Balkan States to the \r\ncommon challenges to security that we all face, such \r\nas irregular migration, organized crime, terrorism, \r\nhybrid threats, cybersecurity and misinformation. The \r\nSofia Declaration adopted at the Summit reaffirmed the \r\nEuropean prospects for the region and made them an \r\nachievable goal.\r\nWe are aware that that is just the beginning of a \r\nnew path that is encouraging but neither easy nor quick. \r\nHowever, the stakes are high, not only for the citizens of \r\nthose countries and for their EU neighbours and friends, \r\nbut also for the global processes aimed at economic and \r\npolitical strengthening and development. We cannot \r\nleave blank spots marked by lagging development, \r\nweak economies and societies susceptible to the present \r\nglobal threats.\r\nIn two days’ time, the citizens of our neighbour \r\nto the south-east, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, will have to take a landmark decision about \r\ntheir future — whether to endorse the unprecedented \r\ncompromise achieved with neighbouring Greece, which \r\nwill clear their path towards Euro-Atlantic integration. \r\nIt is a truly historic moment and shows exactly why we \r\nshould support the citizens of that country as they take \r\nthat new decision for their country.\r\nTwo of our other neighbours face a very difficult \r\ndilemma. We support the dialogue between Belgrade \r\nand Pristina, and we welcome their determination to \r\nmove forward in normalizing bilateral relations with the \r\nhelp of EU mediation. At the same time, we deem the \r\npotential re-tailoring of borders a non-viable solution, \r\nnot just in this case but in general.\r\nImportant elections for Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nare coming up in October. They will serve as a key test \r\nof the country’s unity and determination to progress \r\nfurther along the path of European integration. As we \r\ncan see, the situation in that part of Europe is very \r\ndynamic and fraught with important events that for \r\nmany years to come will determine the direction of the \r\nregion’s development and, to a large extent, the state \r\nof the EU. What we have managed to achieve so far \r\nas a result of our work within the main priorities of \r\nBulgarian foreign policy is part of our contribution to \r\npeace and security on the European continent and the \r\nworld beyond.\r\nHowever, the generally optimistic prospects for \r\nthe Western Balkans and South-Eastern Europea are \r\nin drastic contrast to the conflicts that surround them \r\non three sides — in Ukraine to the north-east, in the \r\nMiddle East to the south-east and in Libya to the south. \r\nMigration f lows and the increasing threat of terrorism \r\nare the direct consequences of conflicts around the \r\nworld. I will address those topics in due course.\r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n12/61 18-30104\r\nFirst, I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention \r\nto the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. In the past \r\nfour and a half years, according to data from the United \r\nNations, the total number of victims in the conflict has \r\nexceeded 10,000, and the number of wounded stands \r\nat 24,000. There is special cause for concern about the \r\ndeteriorating humanitarian and environmental situation \r\nin Donbas. In addition to such dire statistics, there \r\nhas been no real progress in implementing the Minsk \r\nagreements, which, in our view, represent the only way \r\nto a peaceful and sustainable solution to the conflict. \r\nThe existing differences with regard to the deployment \r\nof international peacekeeping forces in eastern Ukraine \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations continue. We, \r\nthe leaders of the States Members of this international \r\nOrganization, share the responsibility to establish a \r\npeaceful, fair and sustainable world order that rests on \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations. I \r\ncall on the Assembly to redouble its efforts to achieve \r\npeace and stability in Ukraine without infringing on its \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nThe situation in Syria remains tragic. Despite \r\nthe efforts of the international community, military \r\nactivities in the country continue, resulting in increasing \r\nnumbers of casualties among the civilian population, as \r\nwell as thousands of new migrants. As a country that \r\nis geographically close to Syria, Bulgaria supports \r\nefforts to prevent any further escalation of the military \r\nconflict. To that end, we support the continuation of \r\npolitical dialogue and intra-Syria negotiations, with \r\nthe aim of finding a permanent political solution to \r\nthe crisis.\r\nWe support the launch of international initiatives \r\nto create conditions that are conducive to restarting the \r\nMiddle East peace process through bilateral talks. We \r\nbelieve that that is the way to achieve a final agreement, \r\nbased on the principle of two States coexisting in peace \r\nand stability. That is why we greatly appreciate and \r\nstrongly support the efforts of Nickolay Mladenov, the \r\nUnited Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East \r\nPeace Process, to improve the humanitarian situation in \r\nthe Gaza Strip as soon as possible.\r\nWith regard to Libya, Bulgaria supports the \r\nUnited Nations Action Plan for Libya and the efforts \r\nof the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, whose \r\nprimary task is to stabilize the country and reach \r\nnational conciliation in the context of the existing \r\npolitical and institutional fragmentation. We support \r\nthe agreement reached by the four key political leaders \r\nfor conducting presidential and parliamentary elections.\r\nIt is impossible to end all conflicts, but I would \r\nnevertheless like to say a few words about another \r\nimportant issue related to peace and security in the \r\nworld, especially after some of the statements we \r\nhave heard from Mr. Abbas, Mr. Netanyahu and \r\nMr. Rouhani. We are of the opinion that in the current \r\ncontext, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on \r\nthe Iranian nuclear programme continues to be a key \r\nelement in the international security architecture. \r\nWe also support all efforts for the full, verifiable and \r\nirreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula \r\nand the establishment of permanent peace in North-\r\nEast Asia.\r\nMigration f lows and refugee crises are a global \r\nphenomenon, the result of a myriad political and \r\nsocioeconomic factors, and of conflicts in various parts \r\nof the world in particular. Let me underscore clearly and \r\nright from the start that irregular migration is a serious \r\nchallenge to our societies’ security and stability. That \r\nis why we need to strengthen cooperation among all \r\nthe countries concerned, including countries of origin, \r\ntransit and destination, in order to reach a sustainable \r\nand permanent solution. It must fully guarantee human \r\nrights and the sovereign right of States to ensure the \r\nsecurity of their borders.\r\nThe efforts of the international community should \r\nfocus chiefly on the main causes of migration, which \r\nare political, socioeconomic and natural — that is, \r\nthe result of natural disasters. We should pay special \r\nattention to the various dimensions of development and \r\nthe integral link between development and security. \r\nHowever, if we do not support those efforts with active \r\nmediation and peacekeeping and do not manage to \r\nresolve current conflicts and prevent future ones, our \r\nchances for success are doomed. That is where I see the \r\ncrucial and unique role of the United Nations, which \r\ncan and should be strengthened if there is sufficient \r\npolitical will on the part of Member States.\r\nDuring its presidency of the Council of the \r\nEuropean Union, Bulgaria took an active part in the \r\nprocess of negotiating the global compact for safe, \r\norderly and regular migration. Finalizing the language \r\nof the compact is an achievement based on multilateral \r\ncooperation, and I am confident that its adoption at \r\nthe Intergovernmental Conference in Morocco in \r\nDecember will lay the groundwork for the successful \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 13/61\r\nimplementation of the first-ever global framework for \r\ncooperation in the area of international migration.\r\nWe in Bulgaria also welcome the completion of \r\nthe consultations on the text of the global compact on \r\nrefugees, which constitutes a comprehensive response \r\nto the problem of large-scale migration f lows, based \r\non the principle of shared responsibility. We have \r\nrecently seen an increase in the numbers of terrorist \r\nattacks all over the world, as well as in the number \r\nof innocent victims of terrorism. Irregular migration \r\nwaves have enabled the infiltration of our countries \r\nand communities by former fighters from Syria, \r\nIraq, Afghanistan and other places, including trained \r\nmembers of terrorist organizations, such as the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Levant and Al-Qaida.\r\nBulgaria categorically condemns all forms and \r\nexpressions of terrorism, no matter what cause they \r\nclaim to support. They undermine peace, security and \r\nthe social and economic development of States. That \r\nis why an effective response to the problem requires \r\nthe coordinated efforts of the entire international \r\ncommunity. That is also why we support the United \r\nNations in its capacity as a universal organization \r\nthat possesses the full range of instruments to lead \r\nand coordinate the process, along with facilitating the \r\nexchange of experience among regional organizations \r\nand national agencies and assisting in streamlining \r\ntheir efforts.\r\nWe support the work of the United Nations Office \r\nof Counter-Terrorism and the specific steps taken to \r\nintensify the Organization’s operations in that regard, \r\nincluding support for the organization of the High-level \r\nConference of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies \r\nof Member States. One priority is taking measures to \r\nprotect young people from being radicalized or joining \r\nterrorist groups, as well as to neutralize the influence of \r\npersons and organizations instigating terrorist attacks.\r\nThis year we mark the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, and for the first time Bulgaria will present \r\nits candidacy for membership of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We rely on the support of Member States. That \r\nis not an end in itself for us but rather an expression \r\nof our consistent policy of working for the protection \r\nand affirmation of human rights in Bulgaria and at \r\nthe global level. Our presidency of the Council of the \r\nEuropean Union also gave Bulgaria the opportunity \r\nto showcase its contribution to various aspects of the \r\nprotection of human rights. We intend to continue to \r\nshare our best practices as a member of the Human \r\nRights Council. The values that give meaning to any \r\npolitical effort subsume the past, the present and the \r\nfuture. That is also what allows us to better comprehend \r\nand appreciate our present efforts.\r\nThere is a moment in Bulgaria’s history of which \r\nwe Bulgarians are justifiably proud. Seventy-five \r\nyears ago, in some of the darkest years of the Second \r\nWorld War, Bulgaria’s citizens, Church and enlightened \r\nleaders and intellectuals stood up to attempts to deport \r\nnearly 50,000 Bulgarian Jews to the death camps. They \r\nmanaged to prevent that from happening. Bulgarians \r\nachieved that at a time when Nazi Germany had \r\nsubordinated and occupied almost all of Europe. \r\nBulgaria is proud of the people who managed to save \r\nnearly 50,000 Jews.\r\nI share the story about the saving of Bulgarian Jews \r\nbecause it carries a very strong message that is relevant \r\nto the present day and to all who feel threatened. It \r\nshows that humaneness and courage can triumph over \r\npower and irrationality and save lives. It reminds us \r\nthat we should never stop fighting for human life and \r\nthe right causes. The salvation of the Bulgarian Jews \r\nis a much-needed example that can reassure us that \r\nvalues are not a forgotten notion but offer a chance for \r\na better future.\r\nThe Bulgarian example should become more widely \r\nknown to more people so that it can give courage to \r\nothers around the world who are fighting to defend their \r\nlives and those lives of others and to protect dignity and \r\nhuman rights. It is our mission at present not to allow \r\nxenophobia and anti-Semitism to return or to permit a \r\ndisregard for the right to live based on race, ethnicity \r\nor other factors. We Bulgarians know that it is possible \r\nand that it has happened before.\r\nOur main task is to guarantee peace and prosperity \r\naround the world. I am convinced that that is attainable, \r\nnot through arms or battles but rather through a greater \r\nsense of humanity and responsibility. We also need \r\nmore than ever to strengthen the role and authority \r\nof the United Nations in its global operations. I am \r\nconfident that, with effort and good will on the part \r\nof all Member States, that grand goal can be achieved.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Bulgaria for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n14/61 18-30104\r\nMr. Boyko Borissov, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Bulgaria, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Trade of the Independent State \r\nof Samoa\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa.\r\nMr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of \r\nthe Independent State of Samoa, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Tuilaepa \r\nSailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Trade of the Independent State of \r\nSamoa, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): I have had the \r\nprivilege of addressing the General Assembly over \r\nthe past 21 years as Samoa’s Prime Minister, and my \r\nmessage has remained consistent throughout those \r\nyears. Put simply, climate change poses our single \r\ngreatest threat, especially to small island developing \r\nStates like Samoa — albeit not through our doing or \r\nchoice — and the need for the international community \r\nto take effective action to mitigate its impact is urgent \r\nand real.\r\nClimate change also encompasses the breadth of \r\nsecurity issues facing our blue Pacific region, including \r\nhuman security, environmental and resource security \r\nand transnational crime and cybersecurity. As we have \r\nexplained to the United Nations before, climate change \r\nis one of the most pressing security challenges facing \r\nisland countries, affecting food security and access to \r\nsafe water and fundamentally affecting our ability to \r\ndraw sustenance from the pristine ocean and seas that \r\nsurround us. It is the highest priority challenge facing \r\nthe countries of the world and does not discriminate \r\nbetween rich and poor.\r\nThe logic of our perspective is simple. Climate \r\nchange affects the whole of Samoa’s realities and \r\naspirations. It affects our society, economy, culture, \r\nfaith and way of life and will continue to be our \r\noverriding policy concern and major preoccupation, \r\nand that of our entire Pacific region, today and well \r\ninto the future.\r\nIt is a societal problem requiring a decisive response \r\nfrom the world community. Its global reach and impact \r\nshould unite and strengthen our resolve, not weaken and \r\ndivide us. As a united community, there is a great deal \r\nthat we can do to arrest, and even reverse, the threat of \r\nclimate change, although its effects are worsening by \r\nthe day. Acting alone, no one country or single group of \r\nnations or organization can win the war against climate \r\nchange. The divergent, yet inextricably linked, interests \r\nof Member States demand that we work together.\r\nOur Paris Agreement on Climate Change was a \r\nbeacon of hope, especially for vulnerable island States. \r\nIt is based on shared responsibilities, trust, collaboration \r\nand principled action. It demonstrates a new brand of \r\ncooperation and a broad outlook, where the narrow \r\npursuits of self-interest and a reliance on economic and \r\npolitical expediencies were to be set aside. It was meant \r\nto be a timely reminder that no action is too small or \r\ninsignificant. All contributions matter, and every action \r\ncounts, irrespective of who provides it. Importantly, it \r\nplaces the responsibility of addressing climate change \r\nsquarely on every leader and every individual country \r\nin terms of the implementation of their nationally \r\ndetermined contributions to the Paris Agreement.\r\nIt is indeed worrisome and alarming that the level of \r\ncommitments to the Paris Agreement by Member States \r\nwill not keep global warming anywhere below 1.5° C, \r\nwhich is the ideal and moral goal required to save planet \r\nEarth. Without that, the continuing existence of low-\r\nlying islands in our Pacific region and elsewhere will \r\nbe in grave doubt. We must work together with a sense \r\nof urgency and commitment to address climate change \r\ntoday. It should not only be science that recommends \r\nwhat we should do but also our very conscience and \r\npolitical will to follow through.\r\nClearly, we want leaders who view the world as a \r\nsingle constituency where all must work together within \r\nthe limits of their capacity and capability to be part of \r\nthe total solution. Samoa also wants to be part of that \r\nsolution, because it is in our interest to do so. As for \r\nthose suggesting that they are being asked to implement \r\nbold actions just for the sake of our vulnerable islands, \r\nthey need to be quietly reminded that in the final \r\nanalysis, implementation initiatives will ultimately \r\nbenefit their economies, their people and the survival \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 15/61\r\nof their countries as well. In fact, the whole world will \r\nstand to benefit.\r\nFor vulnerable countries, the issue does not require \r\nthe setting of new targets, the commissioning of more \r\nstudies and reports or even more polite talking-shops \r\nand structured dialogue sessions. What is needed now \r\nis adaptation in the interest of long-term survival. The \r\nUnited Nations remains our last best hope to provide \r\nthe political will and the necessary commitment to turn \r\nthe tide against climate change.\r\nSamoa appeals to States Members of our \r\nOrganization in positions of world leadership to lead \r\nthe charge in finding and implementing solutions to the \r\ncauses of climate change. As custodians of our world’s \r\nenvironment, we owe it to our future generations to do \r\nwhat needs to be done quickly and decisively. In the \r\nsame way that nations in leadership roles are called to \r\naccount to do the right thing for our world, all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations must uphold their part \r\nof the bargain in the work that needs to be done. Without \r\nthat cooperation from all Member States, reaching \r\nthe objectives that we all know must be achieved will \r\ncontinue to elude us.\r\nThe Pacific region is already dealing with the \r\ndestructive impact of climate change and disasters. \r\nUnprecedented cyclones, f loods, droughts, sea level \r\nrise and ocean acidification are taking their toll on \r\nthe health and well-being of our peoples, environment \r\nand economies. Disaster-related economic losses, as \r\na percentage of gross domestic product, are higher in \r\nPacific island countries than almost anywhere else in \r\nthe world.\r\nOur people are waiting; the world is watching. It \r\nis incumbent on each individual leader and country to \r\nraise the level of ambition, not just as an aspirational \r\ngoal but as deliverables under the Paris Agreement. For \r\nthe Pacific peoples and our blue Pacific region, urgent, \r\nambitious action on climate change is the only option.\r\nWe welcome the determination that we heard in the \r\nSecretary-General’s remarks to the General Assembly \r\nearlier this month to sound the alarm on the need for \r\nbolder action on climate change (see A/73/PV.6). Those \r\nare big demands to deliver on, and it would be naive \r\nto think otherwise. But when the future existence of \r\nsovereign island nations, populations and cultures are \r\nat stake, there is a moral imperative for the world to act \r\ndecisively and collectively.\r\nThe Pacific leaders are increasingly conscious of \r\nand concerned about the security of our region, and we \r\nlook at security not only from the orthodox perspective \r\nof State security but also for what it means for us as \r\nPacific communities. The Framework for Pacific \r\nRegionalism identifies security as one of the four \r\nobjectives of regionalism, a security that ensures stable \r\nand safe human, environmental and political conditions \r\nfor all.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum leaders have renewed \r\ntheir commitment to work together as one blue \r\nPacific continent, particularly in view of the renewed \r\ngeopolitical interests in the Pacific region. Suddenly, \r\nthe Pacific is swimming in a rising tide of so-called \r\nfit-for-purpose strategies, stretching from the tip of \r\nAfrica, encompassing the Indian Ocean and morphing \r\ninto the vast blue Pacific Ocean continent, which is our \r\nhome and place. The big Powers are doggedly pursuing \r\nstrategies to widen and extend their reach and creating \r\na far-reaching sense of insecurity. The renewed vigour \r\nwith which a strategy based on a free and open Indo-\r\nPacific Ocean is being advocated and pursued leaves us \r\nwith much uncertainty. For the Pacific, there is a real \r\nrisk of privileging Indo over Pacific.\r\nWhile the Pacific region is currently enjoying a \r\nperiod of relative stability, drivers of instability exist \r\nin the region and beyond. The 2017 State of Pacific \r\nRegionalism report indicated that shifting global and \r\nregional geopolitics are creating an increasingly complex \r\nand crowded region that places the Pacific at the centre \r\nof contemporary global geopolitics. That trend, coupled \r\nwith broader challenges, such as climate change, rising \r\ninequality, resource depletion, maritime-boundary \r\ndisputes and advances in technology, will continue to \r\nshape the Pacific regional security environment.\r\nWhile the world belabours the issues of security \r\nbased on military might and the wonders of technological \r\nadvancement in achieving such ends, our priority in the \r\nPacific is to maintain the stability of our Governments \r\nand countries. We can do that by reviewing of our \r\ngovernance pathways and ensuring that our elected \r\nleaders respond to people’s needs. Pacific Island \r\nForum members have a very proud history of working \r\ncollectively in response to events and issues that have \r\nchallenged regional security, peace and stability, from \r\nthe 1985 Rarotonga Treaty, which created a nuclear-free \r\nzone in the South Pacific, to a collective approach to \r\naddressing the existential threat of climate change.\r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n16/61 18-30104\r\nThe Pacific region’s current geopolitical and \r\ngeostrategic context underlines the need for an \r\nintegrated and comprehensive security architecture \r\nincorporating an expanded concept of security. A \r\nstable and resilient security environment provides \r\nthe platform for achieving the region’s sustainable \r\ndevelopment aspirations.\r\nIn 2017, in recognition of those considerations, the \r\nPacific Forum leaders agreed to build on the Biketawa \r\nDeclaration and other security-related declarations \r\nissued by the Forum as a foundation for future regional \r\nstrategic responses, recognizing the importance of an \r\nexpanded concept of security and regional cooperation \r\nin building resilience to disasters and climate change. \r\nThe leaders have also prioritized action on climate \r\nchange and disaster-risk management, fisheries and \r\nocean management and conservation, all of which have \r\nsignificant security elements.\r\nAs if being vulnerable to climate change were not \r\na lifelong challenge, the label of Pacific small island \r\ndeveloping State can also bring with it unintended trials \r\nand tribulations. For far too long, the international \r\ncommunity has been given to believe that our States are \r\nlittle and classified as have-nots. We are susceptible to \r\nbeing characterized as countries that have little and that \r\nshould be grateful for whatever is offered to us. We are \r\nhighly protective of our means of livelihood and have \r\nembraced regional action to ensure the sustainability \r\nof our fisheries resources. We are actively asserting \r\nour ambitions to ensure that there is inheritance for \r\nthe generations to come. Any approach to engagement \r\nwith partners must be genuine and durable, premised \r\non understanding, friendship, mutual benefit and a \r\ncollective ambition to achieve sustainable results. It \r\nmust also be non-partisan and non-interventionist. I \r\nrepeat that any engagement must be non-partisan and \r\nnon-interventionist.\r\nIn that process, our partners have fallen short of \r\nacknowledging the integrity of Pacific leadership \r\nand the responsibility that our leaders have for every \r\ndecision made in order to garner support for the \r\nsustainable development of their nations. Some might \r\nsay that there is a patronizing nuance that suggests that \r\nPacific nations do not know what they are doing or are \r\nincapable of reaping the benefits of close relations with \r\ncountries that are, and will be, in the region for some \r\ntime to come. To the extent that emerging partners have \r\nengaged with Pacific countries without conditionality, \r\nthe relationships are perceived to be associated with \r\nproblems of corruption or unprecedented environmental \r\ndegradation. We have the tendency to be bemused by \r\nthe fact that the reaction is an attempt to hide what we \r\nsee as strategic neglect.\r\nWhere we are now would not have been possible \r\nwithout the valuable support of our circle of partners \r\nand the value of the partnerships that we have nurtured \r\nand cultivated over the years to respond to our people’s \r\nmultitudinous needs. The friendly relations that we \r\nhave with some partners are construed by others as \r\ncompromising and obtrusive, prompting some to speak \r\nup for us in order to ward off the influences that we are \r\nsupposedly too naive to recognize. By the same token, \r\nwe are given alternatives that reflect interests beyond \r\naltruism and improvement of the poor. As Pacific \r\nleaders we need to ask ourselves what we ought to do \r\nin order to make a difference for ourselves and for the \r\nworld and to promote our values, which are premised \r\non peace, stability and security.\r\nOur geographical isolation and insularity no longer \r\nshield or protect us from today’s  increasingly complex \r\nand dynamic security challenges — transnational \r\ncrime, nuclear proliferation, challenges to sovereignty \r\nand humanitarian crises. The rules-based international \r\nsystem is being bent out of shape. Gone are the days when \r\nwe took only what we needed from our environment \r\nand were much more conscious of the importance of \r\nthe continuity of our cultures and values, unadulterated \r\nby the infringing, impinging world around us. In those \r\ndays we did not worry much about borders because the \r\noriginal migrations of our peoples defined for us our \r\nocean space and place. Poverty was not a part of our \r\nconsciousness because we cared for each other and the \r\noceans provided their bounty.\r\nWe should not be influenced by economic \r\ndependence, as that is a compromise in itself. We \r\nshould seek to strengthen domestic cohesion, develop \r\nresilience and rethink our governance pathways. The \r\nleaders of the Pacific Islands Forum are committed to \r\na vision for the Pacific — that it should be a region \r\nof peace, harmony, security, social inclusion and \r\nprosperity so that all Pacific people can lead free, \r\nhealthy and productive lives now and into the future. \r\nMoreover, we have committed to working together to \r\nachieve that vision. The blue Pacific platform offers all \r\nPacific countries the adaptive capabilities to address \r\na changing geostrategic landscape. The opportunity \r\nto realize the full benefits of the blue Pacific rests on \r\nour ability to work and stand together as a political \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 17/61\r\nbloc. The challenge for us is to maintain solidarity in \r\nthe face of the intense engagement of an ever-growing \r\nnumber of partners in our region. We should never let \r\nthat challenge divide us.\r\nIn four weeks’ time, Samoa will host the \r\ninterregional meeting of small island developing States \r\nand their development partners in preparation for the \r\nfive-year review of the Small Island Developing States \r\nAccelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA Pathway) \r\nduring the high-level week in September next year. My \r\nGovernment looks forward to welcoming our guests, \r\nand we thank Member States, in particular small island \r\ndeveloping States, for agreeing to allow the SAMOA \r\nPathway to make a brief return to its namesake \r\nand birthplace.\r\nLet me conclude by acknowledging the support of \r\nall States Members of the United Nations, Samoa’s circle \r\nof friends, that supported our candidate’s re-election to \r\nthe Committee on the Rights of the Child.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China.\r\nMr. Wang Yi (China) (spoke in Chinese): Every \r\nSeptember, global attention is focused on the United \r\nNations and on this stately Assembly Hall. People watch \r\nclosely what is happening here, hoping that the United \r\nNations will deliver peace, development, harmony \r\nand prosperity to the world. People look to the United \r\nNations to help them realize their dreams for a better \r\nlife, to a United Nations that is committed to making \r\nitself relevant to all people, thereby making our world a \r\nbetter place for everyone to live in.\r\nThe contemporary international order, which began \r\nwith the founding of the United Nations, is based on the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and is enhanced by the vision and practice of \r\nmultilateralism. It has brought about general peace and \r\nrapid development over the past 70 years or more. A \r\npeople-centred philosophy has gained wide acceptance, \r\nand a broad consensus has formed on the need for \r\ninterdependence and win-win cooperation.\r\nYet it is also true that the international order \r\ntoday faces problems and needs steady reform and \r\nimprovement. The world is changing. As we celebrate \r\nhumankind’s proud achievements and progress, we \r\nmust never lose sight of the challenges and difficulties \r\nwe face in an ever-changing world. We must remain \r\nvigilant. What we see today is that international rules \r\nand multilateral mechanisms are under attack, and the \r\ninternational landscape is filled with uncertainties and \r\ndestabilizing factors. Should we stay committed to \r\nmultilateralism or let unilateralism have its way? Should \r\nwe seek to uphold the architecture of the world order or \r\nallow it to be eroded and collapse? Those are critical \r\nquestions bearing on the future of all countries and the \r\ndestiny of humankind, questions that all countries must \r\ncarefully reflect on and seek answers to.\r\nChina’s answer is clear cut. All along, China \r\nhas upheld the international order and pursued \r\nmultilateralism. Though once kept out of the United \r\nNations for 22 years, China has never wavered in its \r\ncommitment to multilateralism and to the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nChina stayed true to its commitment throughout \r\nthe negotiation process on its return to the General \r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade and then its accession \r\nto the World Trade Organization (WTO) — negotiations \r\nthat lasted 15 long years and were concluded at a certain \r\nprice. China fulfilled its promise and integrated itself \r\ninto the world economic system. After the international \r\nfinancial crisis broke out, China chose not to stand idly \r\nby; instead it worked together with other countries to \r\nget through those challenging times. For many years, \r\nChina has contributed more than 30 per cent of global \r\neconomic growth. It has played its part in helping with \r\nthe global recovery. In the face of new developments and \r\nsevere challenges, China will keep to its commitment \r\nand remain a champion of multilateralism.\r\nStanding at this rostrum in 2015, Chinese \r\nPresident Xi Jinping, in his statement reflecting the \r\nkey understanding of humankind’s common interest \r\nand the future of our planet, called for the building \r\nof a community with a shared future for humankind \r\n(seeA/70/PV.13). That initiative is in keeping with the \r\ntrend of history, and it echoes the call of the times. It \r\nadds to our conviction and strength as we pursue our \r\ncommon endeavour to protect this global village. It \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n18/61 18-30104\r\npoints us in the direction where we should work together \r\nto open up an even better future for humankind.\r\nTo uphold multilateralism in this new era, we \r\nbelieve that the following principles must be adhered \r\nto. First, we must pursue win-win cooperation. Our \r\nworld is undergoing profound changes, never before \r\nseen in this century. Also never seen before are the \r\nproblems and challenges we are facing. No country \r\ncan meet them alone or stay immune to their impact. \r\nWe must replace confrontation with cooperation and \r\ncoercion with consultation. We must remain united as \r\na big family. Instead of forming closed circles, we must \r\npromote common development through consultation \r\ninstead of taking a “winner-takes-all” approach. That \r\nis a sure way to usher in a bright future.\r\nSecondly, we must act in accordance with rules \r\nand order. State-to-State relations must be based on \r\ncredibility, not the wilful revocation of commitments. \r\nInternational cooperation should be guided by rules, \r\nnot impulse. Practising multilateralism is, first and \r\nforemost, about upholding the Charter of the United \r\nNations, observing international law and basic norms \r\ngoverning international relations, and honouring \r\ninternational agreements reached through negotiations.\r\nThirdly, we must uphold the principles of fairness \r\nand justice. In international affairs, fairness and justice \r\nmean equality among all countries, big or small. They \r\nsignify the responsibility of big countries to help \r\nthe small, and rich ones to assist the poor. Fairness \r\nand justice also mean respect for other countries’ \r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as \r\nwell as their choice of development paths and right to \r\na better life and increased development opportunities.\r\nFourthly, we must act to deliver real results. \r\nMultilateralism is not based on empty rhetoric. It must \r\nbe pursued to solve problems. Efforts must be targeted, \r\nresults-oriented and measured by visible progress. \r\nWhether a multilateral mechanism works depends on \r\nthe will and engagement of countries. It is imperative \r\nthat we work together to uphold the international \r\nsystem with the United Nations at its core, as well as the \r\nmultilateral trading system centred on the World Trade \r\nOrganization. Multilateralism requires a strong United \r\nNations. China supports Secretary-General Guterres \r\nin advancing reform of the United Nations system in \r\nthe three critical areas of peace and security, economic \r\ndevelopment and internal management. That reform \r\nshould be led by Member States, and it should prioritize \r\nthe concerns of developing countries, make the United \r\nNations more effective and enhance oversight and \r\naccountability. Stable and predictable funding is critical \r\nto the proper functioning of the United Nations. China \r\nwill continue to fulfil its financial obligations and \r\ncalls on other Member States to pay their membership \r\ncontributions and peacekeeping assessments on time \r\nand in full.\r\nThe momentum of humankind’s drive forward \r\ntowards development and progress is unstoppable. \r\nPeace, reconciliation and harmony represent the \r\npredominant trend, while war, conflict and terror are \r\nopposed by all. Equality, mutual trust and win-win \r\ncooperation are key words of our times, whereas power \r\npolitics and the law of the jungle find no support. As a \r\nmajor responsible country, China is committed to the \r\npath of peaceful development, and it will work together \r\nwith other countries and contribute its share to global \r\npeace and security.\r\nOver the past year, the situation on the Korean \r\npeninsula has seen a major turnaround thanks to the \r\nefforts of all the parties concerned. China, for its \r\npart, has contributed to that progress. China supports \r\nthe comprehensive improvement of relations between \r\nthe north and the south of the peninsula, as well as \r\nefforts to facilitate dialogue between the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States. \r\nChina encourages the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea to continue moving towards denuclearization. \r\nWe believe that it is also incumbent on the United \r\nStates to respond in a timely and positive manner so \r\nas to truly meet the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea halfway. China will continue to honour its \r\ninternational responsibilities and obligations and will \r\nstrictly implement the Security Council resolutions \r\nrelated to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\nChina calls on the Security Council to take timely \r\naction in the light of developments and changes in the \r\nsituation so as to create more favourable conditions \r\nfor a peaceful settlement of the issue on the peninsula \r\nthrough political and diplomatic means. To effectively \r\nsettle the issue we need complete denuclearization and \r\nthe establishment of a peace mechanism. Only when \r\nthose components move in tandem can the issue be \r\ntruly resolved and peace achieved.\r\nRegarding the Iranian nuclear issue, now is a crucial \r\ntime for the continued implementation of the Joint \r\nComprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The JCPOA \r\nis a consensus-based multilateral agreement endorsed \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 19/61\r\nby the Security Council. It serves the common interests \r\nof all the parties concerned and the international \r\ncommunity at large. If it is not implemented, the \r\ninternational nuclear non-proliferation regime will \r\nbe undermined, the authority and role of the Security \r\nCouncil challenged, and peace and stability jeopardized \r\nboth in that region and throughout the world,. That is \r\na scenario from which no one stands to gain. China \r\nurges the parties concerned to continue to observe and \r\nimplement the JCPOA. On that basis, the possibility \r\ncould be explored for a platform for dialogue that is \r\ninclusive and transparent so as to enable each party’s \r\nconcerns to be adequately addressed through talks \r\nand consultations.\r\nThe question of Palestine must not be marginalized. \r\nFor more than seven decades, peace and justice have \r\nremained elusive in that part of the world. What the \r\ninternational community needs most is not a proposal \r\nor an initiative but resolve and action. In order to \r\nimplement a two-State solution, a new round of \r\npeace-promoting efforts must be made with a view to \r\nexploring a new mediation mechanism. To that end, \r\nChina will play its part, and Chinese humanitarian \r\nassistance to the Palestinian people will continue.\r\nThe issue involving Myanmar’s Rakhine state \r\ncannot be resolved overnight, and steady progress \r\nmust be made through a three-phase process involving \r\na cessation of violence, the return of the displaced \r\npersons and economic development. Myanmar and \r\nBangladesh are inseparable neighbours and could well \r\nbe inseparable partners. Yesterday, at my meeting with \r\ncolleagues from Myanmar and Bangladesh and in the \r\npresence of Secretary-General Guterres, an agreement \r\nwas reached between Myanmar and Bangladesh on \r\naccelerating the return of the first wave of displaced \r\npersons. We believe that Myanmar and Bangladesh \r\nare capable of resolving the issue properly through \r\nfriendly negotiations.\r\nChina supports the leading role of the United Nations \r\nin coordinating responses to non-traditional security \r\nchallenges. On the new frontiers of global governance, \r\nsuch as cyberspace and outer space, State sovereignty \r\nmust be upheld, rules observed and responsibilities \r\nhonoured. Terrorism, a threat to all societies, can \r\nnever be justified. Security Council resolutions must \r\nbe vigorously implemented to counter cyberterrorism, \r\nterrorist financing and the spread of radical narratives \r\nso as to eliminate the breeding grounds of terrorism.\r\nDevelopment is essential for our world today. We \r\nneed to address both insufficient development and, \r\nmore importantly, imbalance in development. There \r\nis no one-size-fits-all model. Every country is entitled \r\nto explore a particular development path aimed at \r\ndelivering happiness and security to its people and \r\nbringing about a future of confidence and hope for its \r\nchildren. Countries face various questions with regard \r\nto development. Such questions could be turned into \r\ndrivers for reform, and solutions to problems could bring \r\nabout development. Economic globalization should not \r\nbe a process whereby some profit and others lose; even \r\nless should it result in widening the gap between North \r\nand South. It is important that we adapt to the trend \r\nof economic globalization and ensure that the process \r\nis open, inclusive, balanced and mutually beneficial so \r\nthat it can deliver benefits to all. International trade \r\nis complementary and mutually beneficial in nature. \r\nIt should not be a zero-sum game in which one side \r\ngains at the expense of the others, and no one should be \r\nallowed to place their own interest above the interest of \r\nothers. Protectionism will only be self-defeating, and \r\nunilateral moves will hurt everyone.\r\nWith regard to friction in trade, China stands for \r\na proper settlement of disagreements based on rules \r\nand consensus through dialogue and consultation on an \r\nequal footing. China will not be blackmailed or yield \r\nto pressure. We have not only taken steps to defend our \r\nown legitimate rights and interests but also to uphold \r\nthe free trade system, international rules and the \r\ninternational order for the benefit of global recovery \r\nand the common interests of all countries.\r\nThe implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development should be at the top of the \r\nagenda of the current session of the General Assembly. \r\nWe need to incorporate its implementation into \r\nMember States’ development strategies and pursue \r\ninnovation-driven, coordinated, green and open \r\ndevelopment that benefits all. We need to forge closer \r\npartnerships for development and pursue international \r\ndevelopment cooperation, with the United Nations at \r\nits centre and North-South cooperation as the main \r\nchannel, supplemented by South-South cooperation. To \r\nmeet the challenges of climate change, it is crucial to \r\nachieve sustainable development. China hopes to see \r\nthe conclusion of the negotiations on the implementation \r\nguidelines of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, \r\nscheduled for the end of this year, with a view to boosting \r\njoint efforts for global ecological conservation.\r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n20/61 18-30104\r\nIn pursuing our common cause of humankind’s \r\ndevelopment and progress, China has worked in \r\npartnership with other countries of the international \r\ncommunity. This year marks the fortieth anniversary \r\nof China’s reform and opening up. Over those 40 years, \r\nwe have worked hard and forged ahead successfully \r\nalong a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. \r\nThat path has brought fundamental changes to China. \r\nIn the past 40 years, more than 700 million individuals \r\nin the Chinese population have been lifted out of \r\nabsolute poverty, which accounts for more than 70 per \r\ncent of the global totals for the same period. A basic \r\nmedical insurance system has been set up to cover \r\nChina’s 1.35 billion people, and a social pension \r\nnetwork accessible to more than 900 million people has \r\nbeen fully implemented. China has built approximately \r\n25,000 kilometres of high-speed railway. That accounts \r\nfor two thirds of the global total and helps elevate \r\nglobal infrastructure construction. According to \r\npolls conducted by authoritative international polling \r\nagencies, China is at the top of global rankings in terms \r\nof public satisfaction with its development and public \r\nconfidence in its future. The path of development \r\nthat China is pursuing has provided the world with \r\nopportunities for shared development. Over the past \r\n40 years, China’s foreign trade has averaged an annual \r\ngrowth rate of 14.5 per cent. That has sustained the \r\nimpetus for global growth and provided the world with \r\na huge Chinese market. We have every confidence \r\nthat we will maintain that momentum and continue to \r\nrealize high-quality development. China will accelerate \r\nefforts to build an advanced economic system, which \r\nwill create greater trade opportunities and an even \r\nbetter investment environment for other countries.\r\nChina will not reverse course or shut its doors \r\nbut will rather open its doors even wider to the world. \r\nChina will not erect market barriers but will expand \r\naccess to the Chinese market. Of all of the developing \r\ncountries in the world, China has been the fastest in \r\nterms of opening up at a level unparalleled by others. \r\nWhen it comes to overall tariff reduction, China has \r\naccomplished more than it committed to when it joined \r\nthe WTO. The breadth of China’s openness in services \r\nis close to the average level of developed countries. \r\nIn November, China will host the first International \r\nImport Expo in Shanghai, which will be yet another \r\nmajor step in opening China’s market. Countries are \r\nwelcome to participate actively in it.\r\nThe Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by President \r\nXi Jinping, is a public good that China is providing for \r\nthe world. It has grown into the largest platform for \r\ninternational cooperation. It aims to deliver benefits \r\nfor all through consultations and cooperation. The \r\nInitiative is open, transparent and inclusive. It is \r\nbased on international rules and laws, and it aims to \r\nachieve green, environment-friendly and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. It is about pursuing common prosperity \r\nthrough greater complementarity among participating \r\ncountries. By September, more than 130 countries and \r\ninternational organizations will have signed agreements \r\non Belt and Road cooperation with China. Next year, \r\nChina will host the second Belt and Road Forum for \r\nInternational Cooperation, and we welcome all parties \r\nto attend that event.\r\nChina is the largest developing country in the \r\nworld. Strengthening cooperation and solidarity with \r\nother developing countries has been and will continue \r\nto be a firm strategic priority in China’s diplomacy. \r\nThat choice has been determined by what defines China \r\nas a country and by the system and values that China \r\nupholds. No matter how much China has increased \r\nin strength, and regardless of how the international \r\nlandscape might change, that strategic priority of China \r\nwill not change.\r\nThe United Nations is the primary platform for \r\nadvocating for and practising multilateralism. We hope \r\nthat the current session of the General Assembly will be \r\nremembered for its part in upholding multilateralism, \r\nworld peace and development. We hope that all of \r\nus in the international community will support the \r\nUnited Nations in its efforts to play a central role in \r\ninternational affairs, and we call on people of all \r\ncountries to work together to build a community with a \r\nshared future for humankind.\r\nAddress by Mr. Charlot Salwai Tabimasmas, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Vanuatu.\r\nMr. Charlot Salwai Tabimasmas, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Charlot \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 21/61\r\nSalwai Tabimasmas, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nVanuatu, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Salwai (Vanuatu) (spoke in French): It \r\nis an honour for Vanuatu to join other speakers \r\nin congratulating you, Madam President, on your \r\naccession to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-third session, and we assure you of our full \r\nsupport. I would also like to express my gratitude to \r\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, \r\nfor his excellent leadership. Allow me also to commend \r\nSecretary-General Guterres and reiterate to him my \r\nGovernment’s confidence in his ability to carry out his \r\nfunctions as chief administrator.\r\nI also want to pay tribute to His Excellency the late \r\nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who passed \r\naway last month. Mr. Annan will long be remembered \r\nfor his advocacy for United Nations reform and his \r\ncommitment to resolving major issues peacefully, given \r\nhis faith in mediation and dialogue.\r\nThe United Nations was founded on the vision that \r\nnations can together play an important preventive role \r\nin saving successive generations from the scourge of \r\nwar and restoring confidence in basic human rights. The \r\nfounders also envisioned an organization that would be \r\na pillar of the world order, in which international peace \r\nand security would be guaranteed by international law. \r\nMoreover, they envisaged international mechanisms for \r\nstrengthening social progress and the living conditions \r\nof humankind. During these weeks of debate we have \r\nan opportunity to assess the progress that has been \r\nmade over the past seven decades and to discuss areas \r\nin which we must do more. The theme of the seventy-\r\nthird session, “Making the United Nations relevant to \r\nall people: global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”, is \r\nmore fitting than ever as we deliberate on ways to build \r\na stronger, fairer and more transparent United Nations \r\nthat meets its goals.\r\nThe United Nations has made great strides in the \r\npast few decades. Extreme poverty has been halved. \r\nMore girls are enrolled in school than ever before. More \r\nwomen, especially in rural areas, are playing roles with \r\nincreased responsibility and contributing to the global \r\neconomy. Similarly, the health of mothers and children \r\nhas improved significantly. However, those advances are \r\novershadowed by gaps in the Organization, including \r\nits continued inability to address the growing list of \r\nproblems facing humankind, including preventing \r\ncrises. The Security Council’s inability to take decisive \r\naction on the Syrian issue is one of many examples. \r\nThe Government of Vanuatu joins other Governments \r\nin recalling that membership in the Security Council \r\nis not only a mark of prestige but also entails knowing \r\nhow to demonstrate strong leadership and assume \r\nshared responsibilities to safeguard peace and security \r\nin the world.\r\nMy Government welcomes the reforms that \r\nSecretary-General Guterres is undertaking, prioritizing \r\nprevention and the maintenance of peace while making \r\nthe Organization more coherent and effective through \r\na comprehensive approach. We welcome the efforts to \r\nreform the United Nations development system, which \r\nrequire specific changes within the system in order to \r\nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. \r\nMy Government asks that the United Nations system be \r\nf lexible and provide opportunities to review and adapt \r\nthe configuration, role and development services of the \r\nmany United Nations country teams so as to ensure the \r\nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nWith reference to an important part of the United \r\nNations reform agenda under way, I would like to \r\ndraw attention to the pillar of human rights. Without \r\nan effective and resilient United Nations-led human \r\nrights system within every State, it will be difficult to \r\nemploy preventive diplomacy. United Nations reform \r\nshould consider the entire system by aligning peace and \r\nsecurity more closely with the pillars of development \r\nand human rights.\r\nThe Pacific region is committed to strengthening \r\nclimate resilience as quickly as possible so as to build \r\na strong region. That emerged from the Pacific Islands \r\nForum leaders summit held in Nauru earlier this month. \r\nNature continues to warn us of the imminent dangers to \r\nour planet as it approaches a point of no return beyond \r\nwhich our climate systems will no longer be able to cope. \r\nSummer heatwaves, huge forest fires, extreme drought \r\nand the increasing frequency and scale of weather \r\nevents have brought the debate on global warming to an \r\nindisputable level of importance. I sincerely hope that \r\nthose warnings will provoke concerted climate action.\r\nAs the world’s most at-risk country in terms of \r\nexposure to natural hazards, according to the World \r\nRisk Index of the United Nations University, for Vanuatu \r\nclimate change continues to be the biggest threat to \r\nattaining the national targets of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, and it is currently our worst \r\nproblem, putting the lives of tens of thousands at risk. If \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n22/61 18-30104\r\nthe level of greenhouse-gas emissions continues to rise \r\nrelentlessly, we will witness an escalation of the costs \r\nassociated with the effects of climate change, costs that \r\nvulnerable countries such as Vanuatu cannot afford. \r\nThat will cost us dearly in the future if the international \r\ncommunity does not act now.\r\nMr. Yelchenko (Ukraine), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe Governments of industrialized countries \r\nhave pledged $100 billion annually by 2020 to finance \r\nclimate-change mitigation measures in vulnerable \r\ncountries. But how to attain that goal remains unclear. \r\nWe call for prioritizing those commitments and \r\nputting in place a specific road map for mobilizing and \r\naccumulating the promised funds as soon as possible, \r\nbecause climate change is upon us. We also call for \r\nmore f lexible access to climate funding by simplifying \r\nvalidation procedures, so that vulnerable countries \r\ncan take action and repair the damage caused by \r\nclimate change.\r\nThe Pacific region cannot afford to see the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change relegated to the archives \r\nof the United Nations. We therefore call for the Paris \r\nAgreement’s work programme to be completed and \r\nmade operational at the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Katowice, Poland. Climate change threatens \r\nthe sustainability of the environment, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and people’s inalienable rights, both \r\nnow and in the future. It represents a real danger to \r\nthe survival of future generations and to low-lying \r\ncountries in the Pacific. The current pledges being made \r\nthrough nationally determined contributions are simply \r\nnot enough to reverse climate change. The parties to \r\nthe Paris Agreement must intensify their ambitions to \r\nreach the agreed target limit of no more than 1.5° C. For \r\nvulnerable countries, especially in our region, a failure \r\nto do so would mean even greater exposure to more \r\nfrequent natural disasters.\r\nAs the largest oceanic continent in the world, the \r\nPacific islands region is a vital source of food and income \r\nfor our population. It is therefore important to implement \r\nsustainable policies for the sound management and \r\nconservation of the oceans that can ensure a future for \r\nour peoples. We welcome opportunities to support our \r\nregional efforts to protect our oceans. Vanuatu, like \r\nother countries, has unresolved issues regarding the \r\ndelimitation of its maritime boundaries, which is a very \r\nimportant step in our independence process, and we are \r\ndetermined to resolve those issues. We are committed \r\nto and are encouraged by the decision of the Pacific \r\nleaders, under the auspices of the Pacific Islands \r\nForum, to bring the negotiations forward with a view to \r\nfinishing and reporting in 2019.\r\nVanuatu welcomes the mobilization of the Pacific \r\nIslands Forum to establish a new implementation \r\nagreement on the conservation and sustainable use \r\nof biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, \r\nwhich represents an important opportunity for the \r\nPacific region.\r\nVanuatu maintains its position on denuclearization. \r\nPacific island countries, including our brothers and \r\nsisters in the Federated States of Micronesia, continue \r\nto be exposed to ongoing threats from radioactive \r\ncontaminants, including remnants from the Second \r\nWorld War and unexploded ordnance. We therefore call \r\non Member States to join us in ratifying the Treaty on \r\nthe Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nSince the inception of the United Nations, some \r\n750 million people from more than 80 former colonies \r\nhave gained political independence. However, the \r\nsituation still remains desperate for millions of others \r\naspiring to achieve self-determination. Vanuatu \r\nattaches great importance to the work of the Special \r\nCommittee on Decolonization. The elimination of all \r\nforms of colonialism must remain a top priority on the \r\nUnited Nations agenda, in the spirit of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. New Caledonia is on a path to deciding \r\nits political destiny through a referendum to be held on \r\n4 November. We appeal to the international community \r\nto support the right of the people of New Caledonia to \r\nfully participate in that referendum and, above all, to \r\nensure that it takes place in a free and fair manner.\r\nThe international community is witnessing violence \r\nand human rights abuses against West Papua nationals. \r\nWe urge the Human Rights Council to investigate those \r\nabuses. We also call on our leading counterparts around \r\nthe world to pay more attention to those inhumane \r\nacts and, together with Indonesia, to stop all forms of \r\nviolence and find common ground with nationalists so \r\nas to facilitate the establishment of a process that will \r\nallow them to freely express their choice.\r\nAccording to the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, we all have an obligation to work \r\ntogether to lift the economic, trade and financial \r\nembargoes imposed on the Republic of Cuba, and \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 23/61\r\nlifting those bans will, among other things, allow the \r\nCuban people to benefit and enjoy their human rights.\r\nMy Government’s top priority is to ensure national \r\nsustainable development for our population by 2030, and \r\nwe aim to leave no one behind. Our national sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals are people-oriented, transformative \r\nand indivisible in order to strike a balance to the three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development. We recognize \r\nthat the eradication of poverty in all its forms and aspects \r\nis an essential condition for sustainable development.\r\nHowever, my Government cannot bear the immense \r\nresponsibility of achieving sustainable development in \r\nour country alone, a responsibility that is all the more \r\ndifficult given that we are exposed to increasingly fierce \r\nnatural disasters. Most recently, my Government had to \r\nevacuate some 11,000 people from Ambae Island owing \r\nto increased volcanic activity. That poses a financial \r\nchallenge in the context of an already limited national \r\nbudget. In that regard, I wish to express my sincere \r\nappreciation to the development partners who have \r\nassisted the Government and the people of Vanuatu in \r\nthese difficult times and are helping to fund activities \r\nthat improve the living conditions of our people.\r\nMy Government welcomes the opportunity to \r\npresent Vanuatu’s national voluntary review in 2019, and \r\nwe count on the support and comments of delegations \r\nas we share our progress, shortcomings and challenges. \r\nIn implementing Vanuatu’s sustainable development \r\nplan, we believe it is essential to create sincere and \r\nsustainable partnerships across all sectors and with \r\nmultiple stakeholders. Vanuatu will emerge from \r\nits status as a least-developed country by December \r\n2020. We hope to be able to count on our development \r\npartners to assist us with support measures that will \r\nenable us to attain developed country status with \r\nimproved conditions.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating that Vanuatu \r\nbelieves and trusts in multilateralism. The United \r\nNations has made this world a better place compared \r\nto what it was 70 years ago. While much progress has \r\nbeen made since then, there is still much work ahead of \r\nus if we want to maintain the relevance of the United \r\nNations. International problems require appropriate \r\nsolutions. We need to find ways to act collectively and \r\ninclusively in order to solve those problems. We must \r\ncontinually strive to reform the Organization in order to \r\nmake it more effective so that it meets our expectations \r\ntoday and in the years to come.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Vanuatu for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Charlot Salwai Tabimasmas, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Allen Michael Chastanet, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Finance, \r\nEconomic Growth, Job Creation, External \r\nAffairs and the Public Service of Saint Lucia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Finance, Economic Growth, Job Creation, External \r\nAffairs and the Public Service of Saint Lucia.\r\nMr. Allen Michael Chastanet, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Finance, Economic Growth, Job \r\nCreation, External Affairs and the Public Service \r\nof Saint Lucia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Allen Michael \r\nChastanet, Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, \r\nEconomic Growth, Job Creation, External Affairs and \r\nthe Public Service of Saint Lucia, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Chastanet (Saint Lucia): Allow me to begin \r\nby congratulating the President on her election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session. Her assumption of that important office \r\ncontributes to our progress in breaking down the \r\nbarriers of inequality, considering that she is one of \r\nonly four women to have held that position in 73 years.\r\nThe President is the first woman from the Latin \r\nAmerica and Caribbean region to have been elected \r\nto that post, and we are especially proud of her \r\nachievement. Saint Lucia is a staunch advocate for \r\ngender equality, as evidenced by the large percentage of \r\nSaint Lucian women who hold senior positions in and out \r\nof Government, including the four female ministers in \r\nmy Cabinet. The President can rest assured that she has \r\nmy delegation’s full support at the upcoming session.\r\nI stand before the Assembly today as a leader of \r\na small island developing State (SIDS) that is also a \r\nmiddle-income country. Saint Lucia’s engagement in \r\nthe international system is framed by acronyms that \r\nrepresent designations and categorizations that have \r\nbeen globally accepted. For example, it has become \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n24/61 18-30104\r\naccepted that SIDS are more vulnerable to natural \r\nhazards than other countries. The fact that the resulting \r\ndamage from natural disasters has a greater overall \r\nimpact on our economies by virtue of our small size \r\nhas also become widely accepted. The fact that SIDS \r\nthat are also middle-income countries face additional \r\nchallenges because of the assumptions regarding the \r\ncapabilities of countries carrying that designation has \r\nalso been acknowledged.\r\nWe all know those truths. They are, in fact, self-\r\nevident. This Hall has echoed with the words of SIDS \r\nand middle-income country leaders, who make plain \r\nand clear, year after year, the challenges that we \r\nface. Yet global policies, programmes and strategies \r\nremain unfairly unaccommodating to those very real \r\nand true challenges. The world acknowledges our \r\nacronyms, but little or nothing else changes. Saint \r\nLucia remains economically vulnerable to de-risking \r\nand the loss of correspondent banking relations. \r\nWe remain excluded from access to concessionary \r\nfinancing. Our reputations are unfairly tarnished by \r\ntax-related labels. We continue to struggle under the \r\nweight of international frameworks that do not provide \r\nan enabling environment for my country to chart an \r\neffective sustainable development path or even to be \r\nable to take control of our own destiny.\r\nDespite the fact that the odds remain stacked \r\nagainst us, Saint Lucia must survive and persist. I have \r\nan obligation to the people of my country, and so I \r\nmust find new and innovative ways, regardless of the \r\ndifficulties, to keep our economy growing and to ensure \r\nand enhance environmental and social protections. I \r\ndo not have the luxury of waiting for the international \r\nsystem to adjust to the special needs of countries like \r\nmy own, while natural disasters continue to threaten \r\nand erode the gains that we have made. In preparation \r\nfor the coming hurricane season, Saint Lucia has had \r\nto spend three times the amount of money that we did \r\nlast season. In order to meet those costs, we have had to \r\nimpose new taxes to facilitate our preparedness.\r\nFor example, we have introduced a water tax \r\nto assist with the de-silting of our dam, a gas tax to \r\nassist with road rehabilitation and slope stabilization, \r\nand an airport tax to assist with the development of a \r\nnew terminal, as well as highway and f lood mitigation \r\nmeasures around the airport. Saint Lucia is moving \r\nforward with an aggressive agenda to reform our \r\ninstitutions and build a more resilient country. We \r\nare making difficult decisions and are committed to \r\nincreasing the productivity of our Government through \r\nthe use of e-Government tools. I want to acknowledge \r\nand thank Estonia for its assistance in that area.\r\nWe are building resilience with the support of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, which has given us assistance in \r\nthe form of engineers, and with loans from Taiwan to \r\nenable us to rebuild our roads and our airport. I want \r\nto thank my citizens, in particular, for their continued \r\nsupport and understanding. We will play our part in the \r\nadaptation of our economy, and we will adapt to the \r\nnew normal.\r\nThe President of the World Bank has acknowledged \r\nthat “good health is the foundation of a country’s human \r\ncapital, and no country can afford low-quality or unsafe \r\nhealth care”. The challenge of providing adequate and \r\naffordable health care is another area of focus for Saint \r\nLucia. We understand that preventive and affordable \r\nhealth care is critical to the social development of \r\nany nation, and more so for a small State with a \r\nsmall population. We are plagued with cases where \r\nindividuals delay in seeking early medical assistance \r\nowing to the high cost, only to be saddled with a serious \r\ndiagnosis later, thereby increasing the cost burden to \r\nthe State and the individual.\r\nWe have therefore taken steps to address the issue \r\nfrom multiple angles. We are working with partners \r\nsuch as the European Union and the World Bank with \r\nthe goal of implementing the necessary policies and \r\nlegislation to give life to a national health-insurance \r\nscheme. We are also looking into preventive approaches, \r\nsuch as the imposition of appropriate labelling and a \r\nsugar tax, as we grapple with the high prevalence of \r\nnon-communicable diseases. We are also expanding \r\nour after-school programmes, which focus on building \r\nhealthy lifestyles through physical activity and diet. \r\nWe are establishing sports academies complete with \r\nnutritionists who will be community-based so that their \r\nexpertise can be shared.\r\nSaint Lucia has worked hard to grow and develop \r\nwithin the context of an international system that \r\nacknowledges our existence and needs only theoretically, \r\nwhile any practical and tangible manifestation of those \r\nacknowledgements is rarely seen or felt.\r\nWe have seen the disastrous impact of natural \r\ndisasters brought on by the changes in our climate. As \r\nI speak, my country is suffering from the ravages of \r\nTropical Storm Kirk, which was on a projected course \r\nnorth of my island but changed direction overnight and \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 25/61\r\nmoved directly over Saint Lucia. This morning, Saint \r\nLucia also suffered an earthquake. Early reports indicate \r\ndamage to our utilities that remain above ground and \r\nextensive damage to the agricultural sector. Once again, \r\nmy heart goes out to our hard-working men and women \r\nand the communities that depend on agriculture. But \r\nthey may rest assured that regardless of the difficulties, \r\nwe will provide the necessary support to help our \r\npeople recover as quickly as possible. My thoughts and \r\nprayers are also with the Government and the people \r\nof Barbados, who have also been affected, as well as \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, which now lies in \r\nthe path of the storm, and Martinique, which suffered \r\nan earthquake this morning.\r\nOur resilience as a people and our ability to pick \r\nourselves up should not be used to punish us. I applaud \r\nJapan, India and the numerous states within the United \r\nStates of America that have the capacity to respond \r\neffectively to natural disasters. I envy the fact that they \r\nhave the fiscal and policy space they need to enable \r\nthem to effectively recover and rebuild, while we, as \r\nSIDS, are continually denied that ability.\r\nWe are aware that Dominica, the British Virgin \r\nIslands and Puerto Rico, among others, are still \r\nrecovering from the storms one year later. Yet little \r\nhas changed. The Caribbean Community-United \r\nNations High-Level Pledging Conference to support \r\nreconstruction efforts in the region following \r\nHurricanes Irma and Maria received pledges of more \r\nthan $1.3 billion, but there remains a significant gap \r\nbetween the pledges made and the actual amounts that \r\nhave been disbursed. While those pledges were well \r\nintended, we have been let down once again.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the initiative to convene a \r\nhigh-level meeting on the challenges of middle-income \r\ncountries during this seventy-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Saint Lucia has continued to place \r\nour concerns about debt sustainability on the global \r\nagenda. We have joined the call for the creation of a \r\nhighly indebted middle-income-country initiative \r\nbased not only on the urgent need for debt relief, but also \r\non the need to acknowledge and highlight the negative \r\nimplications of the challenges that middle-income \r\ncountries face in accessing concessionary \r\nfinancing — so vital to building resilience in our \r\ncountries. We fear a business-as-usual approach to \r\nsuch a meeting, but remain hopeful that it will provide \r\nsubstantive outcomes with actionable solutions.\r\nMultilateralism is under threat. We have heard the \r\ncries from leaders this week. The winds of nationalism \r\nthat threaten to blow us away from our collective \r\nendeavours here at the United Nations are gathering \r\nstrength. But Saint Lucia believes that it is only \r\nwithin a strong, functional multilateral system that the \r\nguarantees of world peace and security can be provided. \r\nTo paraphrase what Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres has said, in a world in which all problems are \r\nglobal, there is no way countries can handle issues by \r\nthemselves. We need global responses.\r\nThe ongoing reform of the United Nations system \r\nis critical. The increasingly chaotic world requires \r\nan organization that is responsive and effective and \r\nthat reflects the political and economic reality of a \r\nchanging world and of all its Member States. We can \r\nno longer operate within a framework of ideologies, \r\npolicies, institutions and patterns of behaviour that \r\nwere established at a time long past to deal with \r\ncircumstances long gone.\r\nWe must be willing to challenge discrimination \r\nand exclusion if we hope to create an equal and just \r\nworld for all. Every country has a role to play in this \r\nglobal environment. We know that. Saint Lucia joins \r\nthe other voices calling for an end to the more than \r\nhalf-a-century-old embargo imposed on our neighbour \r\nCuba, and to all restrictions on the rights of the Cuban \r\npeople, particularly regarding liberty, security and \r\nadvancement. Similarly, we call for an end to the \r\nrestrictions on the legitimate aspirations of Taiwan \r\nto participate as an observer in key international \r\ninstitutions, such as the World Health Organization, \r\nthe International Civil Aviation Organization and the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange (UNFCCC). We demand that as much for us \r\nas for them.\r\nIn our hemisphere, where confrontations and \r\ndisagreements exist, I reaffirm Saint Lucia’s position \r\nthat all conflicts must be resolved through diplomatic \r\nchannels. As we work to reform this institution, we \r\nmust ensure that no one is left behind. We must find \r\nthe political will and courage to ensure that the United \r\nNations, as currently evolved, not only acknowledges \r\nthe challenges of its membership but provides adequate \r\nsolutions for all.\r\nNotwithstanding the myriad challenges that \r\nframe our engagement in the international system, \r\nSaint Lucia remains committed to the objectives of \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n26/61 18-30104\r\nmultilateralism. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development was a triumph of multilateral \r\ncooperation, but it is the successful implementation of \r\nthe Agenda, the fulfilment of the promise of its purpose, \r\nthat will define the true measure of our collective will \r\nto transform and develop as a global community.\r\nIt is within that context that Saint Lucia has \r\ncommitted to presenting its voluntary national review \r\nof our progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda at \r\nthe 2019 high-level political forum on sustainable \r\ndevelopment. I am also pleased to report that Saint Lucia \r\nwill deposit the required instrument to ratify the Doha \r\nAmendment to the Kyoto Protocol before the start of the \r\ntwenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe UNFCCC. This week, Saint Lucia also reaffirmed \r\nits commitment to international law by signing the \r\nRegional Agreement on Access to Information, Public \r\nParticipation and Justice in Environmental Matters in \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean and the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nIn order to build peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies, SIDS, particularly those that \r\nare middle-income countries, must look to a different \r\ncourse of action in order to arrive at a more immediate \r\nsolution to our development challenges, while we \r\ncontinue to call for changes in the international system. \r\nSaint Lucia has recorded two successive years of \r\nconsistent economic growth. We have increased our \r\ntax revenue and are on course to attract record foreign \r\ndirect investment. We are still competing, having to \r\nfind new ways to ensure our growth and development, \r\nbut imagine how much better we could do in building \r\neconomic and social resilience to further enhance our \r\nability to meet our sustainable development goals and \r\nimprove the quality of life of our citizens if a fair and \r\njust international enabling environment were made \r\navailable to us.\r\nLet us not forget that we come together here as \r\nnations united to build institutions, norms and rules \r\nthat advance the shared interests of all, not only those \r\nof a select few. The enormous challenges of our moment \r\nin history require a renewed social contract, based on \r\nshared responsibility, and the space to achieve that \r\nglobal compact is right here at the United Nations. Let \r\nus draw on the inspiration of Nelson Mandela and his \r\nincredible ability to forgive and find solutions for the \r\ngreater human good.\r\nThere is a Buddhist proverb that says, “To know \r\nand not to do is not yet to know”. If the international \r\ncommunity claims to know and accept the special \r\ncircumstances and vulnerabilities of the SIDS, and \r\ndoes nothing to remedy the systems and frameworks \r\nthat exacerbate our vulnerability, can the international \r\ncommunity say that it really knows? Have we truly \r\naccepted the evidence? While the answers to those \r\nquestions may not be readily available, countries like \r\nmy own have to chart a development path through \r\nthis changing and volatile world. It is my hope that as \r\nmultilateralism evolves, and with it this institution, we \r\nwill arrive at knowing and at doing what must be done.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Finance, Economic Growth, Job Creation, \r\nExternal Affairs and the Public Service of Saint Lucia \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Allen Michael Chastanet, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Finance, Economic Growth, Job \r\nCreation, External Affairs and the Public Service \r\nof Saint Lucia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mahathir bin Mohamad, Prime \r\nMinister of Malaysia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, Prime Minister of \r\nMalaysia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, \r\nPrime Minister of Malaysia, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Mohamad (Malaysia): I would like to join \r\nothers in congratulating the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session. I am confident \r\nthat with her wisdom and vast experience, this session \r\nwill achieve the objectives of its theme. I assure her \r\nof Malaysia’s full support and cooperation towards \r\nachieving those noble goals.\r\nAllow me to also pay tribute to her predecessor, \r\nMiroslav Lajčák, for his dedication and stewardship in \r\nsuccessfully completing the work of the seventy-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly. I also commend the \r\nSecretary-General and the United Nations staff for \r\ntheir tireless efforts in steering and managing the \r\nOrganization’s activities globally.\r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 27/61\r\nI particularly want to pay tribute to the late Kofi \r\nAnnan, who served as the Organization’s seventh \r\nSecretary-General from 1997 to 2006 and, sadly, passed \r\naway in August. Malaysia enjoyed a positive and active \r\nengagement with the United Nations during his tenure.\r\nThe theme of this seventy-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, “Making the United Nations \r\nrelevant to all people: global leadership and shared \r\nresponsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties”, remains true to the aspirations of our founding \r\nfathers. The theme is most relevant and timely and is \r\nespecially pertinent in the context of the new Malaysia. \r\nThe new Government of Malaysia, recently empowered \r\nwith a strong mandate from its people, is committed to \r\nensuring that every Malaysian has an equitable share in \r\nthe prosperity and wealth of the nation.\r\nA new Malaysia emerged after the fourteenth \r\ngeneral election, in May this year, in which Malaysians \r\ndecided to change their Government, which had been \r\nin power for 61 years, that is, since independence. We \r\ndid that because the previous Administration indulged \r\nin a politics of hatred, racial and religious bigotry \r\nand widespread corruption. The process of change \r\nwas achieved democratically, without violence or loss \r\nof life.\r\nMalaysians want a new Malaysia that upholds the \r\nprinciples of fairness, good governance, integrity and \r\nthe rule of law. They want a Malaysia that is a friend \r\nto all and an enemy to none, a Malaysia that remains \r\nneutral and non-aligned, a Malaysia that detests and \r\nabhors war and violence. They also want a Malaysia \r\nthat will speak its mind on what is right and wrong, \r\nwithout fear or favour; a new Malaysia that believes in \r\ncooperation based on mutual respect and mutual gain; \r\na new Malaysia that offers a partnership based on our \r\n“prosper-thy-neighbour” philosophy. We believe in \r\nthe goodness of cooperation and that prosperous and \r\nstable neighbours contribute to our own prosperity \r\nand stability.\r\nThe new Malaysia will firmly espouse the \r\nprinciples promoted by the United Nations in our \r\ninternational engagements. Those include the \r\nprinciples of truth, human rights, the rule of law, \r\njustice, fairness, responsibility and accountability, as \r\nwell as sustainability. It is within that context that the \r\nnew Government of Malaysia has pledged to ratify all \r\nremaining core United Nations instruments related to \r\nthe protection of human rights. It will not be easy for us \r\nto do because Malaysia is multi-ethnic, multireligious, \r\nmulticultural and multilingual. We will provide the \r\nspace and time for all to deliberate and to decide freely \r\nbased on the principles of democracy.\r\nWhen I last spoke here, in 2003 (see A/58/PV.11), I \r\nlamented how the world had lost its way. I bemoaned the \r\nfact that small countries continued to be at the mercy of \r\nthe powerful. I argued for the need for the developing \r\nworld to push for reform, enhance capacity-building \r\nand diversify the economy. We needed to maintain \r\ncontrol of our destiny.\r\nToday, 15 years later, the world has not changed very \r\nmuch. If anything, the world is far worse. Today, the \r\nworld is in a state of turmoil economically, socially and \r\npolitically. There is a trade war between the two most \r\npowerful nations, and the rest of the world is feeling the \r\npain. Socially, new values are acting to undermine the \r\nstability of nations and their people. Freedom has led \r\nto the negation of the concept of marriage and families, \r\nmoral codes and respect for one another.\r\nBut the worst turmoil is in the political arena. We \r\nsee acts of terror everywhere. People are tying bombs \r\nto their bodies and blowing themselves up in crowded \r\nplaces. Trucks are driven into holiday crowds. Wars are \r\nfought, and people beheaded with short knives. Acts \r\nof brutality are broadcast live to the world. Masses of \r\npeople risk their lives to migrate, only to be denied \r\nasylum while being forced to sleep in the open and \r\nfreeze to death. Thousands starve, and tens of thousands \r\ndie in cholera epidemics. No one, no country is safe. \r\nSecurity checks inconvenience travellers. There can be \r\nno liquids on planes. The slightest suspicion leads to \r\ndetention and unpleasant questioning.\r\nIn order to fight the terrorists, all kinds of security \r\nmeasures, gadgets and equipment are deployed. Big \r\nbrother is watching, but acts of terror continue. Malaysia \r\nfought the bandits and terrorists for independence and \r\ndefeated them. We used the military, to be sure, but \r\nalongside it — and more importantly — we campaigned \r\nto win the hearts and minds of the people. The present \r\nwar against the terrorists will not end until the root \r\ncauses are found and removed and hearts and minds \r\nare won.\r\nWhat are the root causes? In 1948, Palestinian \r\nland was seized to form the State of Israel. The \r\nPalestinians were massacred and forced to leave their \r\nland. Their homes and farms were seized. They tried \r\nto fight a conventional war with help from sympathetic \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n28/61 18-30104\r\nneighbours; the friends of Israel ensured that that attempt \r\nfailed. More Palestinian land was seized, and Israeli \r\nsettlements were built on more and more Palestinian \r\nland. The Palestinians themselves are denied access \r\nto the settlements built on their land. The Palestinians \r\ninitially tried to fight with catapults and stones. They \r\nwere fired on with live bullets and arrested. Thousands \r\nare incarcerated. Frustrated and angry, unable to fight \r\na conventional war, the Palestinians resort to what we \r\ncall terrorism.\r\nThe world does not care, even when Israel breaks \r\ninternational laws, seizing ships carrying medicine, \r\nfood and building materials in international waters. The \r\nPalestinians fired ineffective rockets that hurt no one. \r\nMassive retaliations were mounted by Israel, rocketing \r\nand bombing hospitals, schools and other buildings and \r\nkilling innocent civilians, including schoolchildren \r\nand hospital patients, among others. The world has \r\nrewarded Israel, deliberately provoking Palestine by \r\nrecognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\r\nIt is the anger and frustration of the Palestinians and \r\ntheir sympathizers that cause them to resort to what we \r\ncall terrorism, but it is important to acknowledge that \r\nany act that terrifies people also constitutes terrorism. \r\nStates dropping bombs or launching rockets that maim \r\nand kill innocent people also terrify people — they are \r\nalso acts of terrorism.\r\nMalaysia hates terrorism. We will fight it, but we \r\nbelieve that the only way to fight terrorism is to remove \r\nthe cause. Let the Palestinians return to reclaim their \r\nland. Let there be a State of Palestine. Let there be \r\njustice and the rule of law. Warring against them will not \r\nstop terrorism, nor will out-terrorizing them succeed.\r\nWe need to remind ourselves that the United \r\nNations, like the League of Nations before it, was \r\nconceived for the noble purpose of ending wars between \r\nnations. Wars are about killing people. Modern wars are \r\nabout mass killings and total destruction countrywide. \r\nCivilized nations claim that they abhor killing for any \r\nreason. When a man kills, he commits the crime of \r\nmurder, and the punishment for that may be death.\r\nBut wars, as we all know, encourage and legitimize \r\nkilling. Indeed, such killings are regarded as noble, and \r\nthe killers are hailed as heroes. They have medals pinned \r\nto their chests and statues erected in their honour, with \r\ntheir names mentioned in the history books. There is \r\nsomething wrong with our way of thinking and with \r\nour value system. Kill one man and it is murder; kill a \r\nmillion and they become a hero.\r\nHowever, we persist in believing that conflict \r\nbetween nations can be resolved with war, and because \r\nwe do so, we must prepare for war. The old adage says, \r\n“if you want peace, prepare for war”. We are forever \r\npreparing for war, inventing more and more destructive \r\nweapons. We now have nuclear bombs that are capable \r\nof destroying whole cities, but we also now know that \r\nthe radiation emanating from the explosion will affect \r\neven the country that uses the bomb. A nuclear war \r\nwould destroy the world.\r\nThat fear has caused the countries of Europe and \r\nNorth America to maintain peace for over 70 years. \r\nHowever, that is not the case for other countries. Wars \r\nin the other countries can help test the new weapons \r\nbeing invented, and so the arms exporters sell them to \r\nwarring countries. We see their arms in wars fought \r\nbetween smaller nations. Those are not world wars, but \r\nthey are no less destructive. Hundreds of thousands of \r\npeople have been killed, whole countries devastated, and \r\nnations bankrupted because of fantastic new weapons.\r\nSuch wars give handsome dividends to the arms \r\nmanufacturers and traders. The arms business is \r\nnow the largest business in the world. They profit \r\nshamelessly from the deaths and destruction that they \r\ncause. Indeed, so-called peace-loving countries often \r\npromote that shameful business. Today’s weapons cost \r\nmillions. Fighter jets cost about $100 million each, and \r\nmaintaining them can cost tens of millions. Yet poorer \r\ncountries are persuaded to buy them, even if they \r\ncannot afford them. They are told that their neighbours \r\nor their enemies have them. It is therefore imperative \r\nthat they, too, have such weapons. While their people \r\nstarve and suffer from all kinds of deprivation, a huge \r\npercentage of the budget of many countries is allocated \r\nto the purchase of modern arms. The fact that their \r\nbuyers may never have to use them does not bother the \r\npurveyors at all.\r\nIn Myanmar, Muslims in Rakhine state are being \r\nmurdered and their homes torched. Millions of refugees \r\nhave been forced to f lee, to drown in the high seas or \r\nlive in makeshift huts without water or food and with \r\nthe most primitive sanitation. Yet the authorities of \r\nMyanmar, including a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, deny \r\nthat that is happening. I believe in non-interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of nations, but is the world supposed \r\nto watch massacres being carried out and do nothing? \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 29/61\r\nNations are independent, but does that independence \r\nmean they have a right to massacre their own people?\r\nOn the other hand, in terms of trade, nations are no \r\nlonger independent. Free trade means that there is no \r\nprotection for the infant industries in small countries. \r\nThey must abandon tariff restrictions and open their \r\ncountries to invasion by the products of the rich and \r\npowerful. Yet the simple products of the poor are \r\nsubjected to clever barriers so that they cannot penetrate \r\nthe market of the rich. Malaysian palm oil is labelled as \r\nharmful to health, and it is claimed that the palm oil \r\nestates are destroying animal habitats. Food products \r\nof the rich are declared to be free of palm oil. Now \r\npalm diesel is also condemned because the producers \r\ndecimate virgin jungles. The caring people making \r\nthose claims forget that their boycott deprives hundreds \r\nof thousands of people of jobs and a decent life. We in \r\nMalaysia care for the environment. Some 48 per cent of \r\nour country remains virgin jungle. Can our detractors \r\nclaim the same about their own countries?\r\nMalaysia is committed to sustainable development. \r\nWe have taken steps, for example by improving \r\nproduction methods, in order to ensure that our palm \r\noil production is sustainable. By December 2019, the \r\nMalaysian Sustainable Palm Oil standard will become \r\nmandatory. That will ensure that every drop of palm oil \r\nproduced in Malaysia will be certified as sustainable \r\nby 2020.\r\nAll around the world, we observe a dangerous \r\ntrend towards inward-looking nationalism. We see \r\nGovernments pandering to populism, retreating from \r\ninternational collaboration and closing their borders \r\nto the free movement of people, goods and services, \r\neven as they talk of a borderless world and free trade. \r\nWhile globalization has indeed brought us some \r\nbenefits, the effects have been proven to threaten the \r\nindependence of small nations. We cannot even talk or \r\nmove around without having our voices and movements \r\nrecorded and often used against us. Data on everyone \r\nis being captured and traded by powerful nations and \r\ntheir corporations.\r\nMalaysia lauds the United Nations for its \r\nendeavours to end poverty and protect our planet and \r\nfor its efforts to try to ensure that everyone enjoys \r\npeace and prosperity. However, I would like to mention \r\nthe need for reform in the Organization. Five countries, \r\non the basis of their victories in wars fought more than \r\n70 years ago, must not be allowed to claim to have a \r\nright to hold the world to ransom forever. They cannot \r\ntake the moral high ground, preaching democracy and \r\nregime change in the countries of the world while they \r\ndeny democracy in this Organization.\r\nI have suggested that the vetoing of a draft \r\nresolution in the Security Council should require that \r\nat least two permanent members, supported by three \r\nnon-permanent members of the Council, vote against it. \r\nThe General Assembly should then uphold the decision \r\nwith a simple majority. I will not say any more.\r\nI must admit that the world without the United \r\nNations would be disastrous. We need the United \r\nNations, and we need to sustain it with sufficient funds. \r\nNo one should threaten it with financial deprivation.\r\nAfter 15 years’ absence and at 93 years old, I \r\nnow return to this rostrum with the burdensome task \r\nof bringing the voice and hopes of the new Malaysia \r\nto the world stage. The people of Malaysia, proud of \r\ntheir recent democratic achievement, have high hopes \r\nthat around the world we will see peace, progress and \r\nprosperity. For that, we look to the United Nations to \r\nhear our plea.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nMalaysia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, Prime Minister of \r\nMalaysia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of \r\nGovernment of the Principality of Andorra\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Head of Government of the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra.\r\nMr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of Government \r\nof the Principality of Andorra, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Antoni Martí Petit, \r\nHead of Government of the Principality of Andorra, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Martí Petit (Andorra) (spoke in Catalan; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): For the people \r\nof Andorra, 2018 is a year of double celebration, globally \r\nand locally speaking. On 28 July, the Principality of \r\nAndorra celebrated 25 years since its entry into the \r\nUnited Nations, and on 10 December, it will be 70 \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n30/61 18-30104\r\nyears since the adoption of the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights.\r\nAs I have already mentioned, those two events \r\nhave both a global and a local significance — what \r\nsome people call “glocal”. In fact, the 1948 Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights has a global dimension for \r\nAndorra, as well as for the other countries that make up \r\nthe international community. But it also has strong local \r\nroots, because fundamental rights have been respected \r\nin Andorra since time immemorial. It is therefore no \r\nwonder that the Andorran Constitution expressly states \r\nthat the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is in \r\nforce in Andorra.\r\nThat is why our country wanted to play an active \r\npart in the Stand Up for Human Rights campaign, \r\nemphasizing the importance of the dissemination \r\nof human rights in the area of education. The United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, \r\nMichelle Bachelet, with whom I have had the honour \r\nof working in the Ibero-American community in recent \r\nyears, knows that she can count on Andorra to ensure \r\nthat the Declaration made on 10 December 1948 remains \r\nas valid and as strong as ever. As I have already said, \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights was already \r\npart of Andorran positive law even before Andorra \r\nbecame a Member of the United Nations.\r\nI would now like us to reflect on what the world \r\nwas like 25 years ago, when Andorra joined the \r\nOrganization as a full Member. The year 1993 was a \r\ntime of hope for everyone. The fall of the Iron Curtain \r\nand the end of the Cold War gave way to a wave of \r\nunprecedented democratization. Never had so many \r\npeople in the world lived under democracy as during \r\nthe final years of the twentieth and the early years of the \r\ntwenty-first century. Human rights were strengthened, \r\neconomies grew and inequalities were gradually \r\ndiminishing. They were years of peace, cooperation \r\nand multilateralism, as well as respect, understanding \r\nand dialogue among cultures and religions. Around us, \r\non the old continent, they were years of optimism in \r\nthe long and fruitful process of European construction.\r\nToday, we all remember that period with a certain \r\ndegree of nostalgia. We were reminded of that this \r\nsummer during the meaningful homages paid to the \r\nformer Secretary-General the late Kofi Annan, who \r\ndid so much for peace and multilateralism throughout \r\nthe end of the past century and the beginning of this \r\nmillennium. We saw it again just this week during the \r\nPeace Summit dedicated to Nelson Mandela (see A/73/\r\nPV.4 et seq.), who was, without a doubt, one of the key \r\nfigures of that historic moment.\r\nTwenty-five years on, many of the hopes of \r\n1993 have become blurred and, despite some of \r\nthe milestones reached, we have slipped back. The \r\nprestigious non-governmental organization Freedom \r\nHouse has noted, year after year, a constant decline in \r\nworld democracy since 2006. In its most recent report, \r\nwe read that in 2017, only 4 of every 10 people live in \r\nfree countries. That slow decline in democratic regimes \r\nhas been accompanied by an increase in inequality, \r\nintolerance and extremism. Even in the most established \r\ndemocracies, we increasingly hear the voices of people \r\nwho have suffered discrimination in silence for many \r\nyears — women, persons with disabilities and victims \r\nof sexual abuse or abuse of any kind. All of that shows \r\nus that our optimism 25 years ago was rather naive.\r\nHowever, despite all the disappointments and all \r\nthe faults, we must still defend the international order \r\nthat was created by the United Nations just after the \r\nend of the Second World War. We must defend that \r\norder because it is based on three principles that are \r\nas elemental as they are universal. All of us have the \r\nsame rights; what affects all of us must be decided by \r\nall of us; and any conflict must be solved peacefully \r\nand lawfully. When I say “all of us”, I am referring \r\nto everybody, individually, within a representative \r\ndemocracy and to all countries, on an equal footing, \r\nhere at the General Assembly.\r\nRepresentative democracy and multilateralism \r\nshare a set of common values and it is therefore not \r\nsurprising that they should end up in crisis at the same \r\ntime. In my view, the democratic multilateral order \r\nis threatened by the two extremes of populism and \r\ntechnocracy. In the face of complex problems, populism \r\nproposes solutions that are simple but that are not \r\nsolutions, because they end up creating new problems \r\nand calling into question democratic principles and \r\nvalues. In the face of complex problems, technocracy \r\nproposes solutions that are as complex as they are \r\nelitist and that rather than being inclusive, generate \r\ninequality and bypass many people. Populism is fed \r\nby the disappointment of people who have been left to \r\none side and have suffered from exclusion, a lack of \r\nunderstanding and inequality.\r\nIn recent years, we have heard time and time \r\nagain that the world is struggling between opening \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 31/61\r\nup and closing down, between multilateralism and \r\nunilateralism, between cooperation and protectionism. \r\nBut perhaps the mistake lies in wishing to present \r\nthings in that way. All too often, defenders of the \r\nmultilateral order and globalization believe that we \r\nhave made no errors and that it is other people who are \r\nmistaken, without seeing that globalization has created \r\nantibodies, some harmful and some not — because \r\nperhaps not every kind of globalization is good.\r\nIn the face of that dialectic between opening up \r\nand closing down, we should not seek confrontation \r\nbut look for balance. There should be a balance \r\nbetween cosmopolitanism and being deeply rooted in \r\ntradition, because there are advantages to both. All too \r\noften we have focused on the risks of protectionism, \r\npopulism and closing down, without realizing that \r\nthere is also another risk — that of elitist and inhumane \r\nglobalization, which is not very inclusive, if at all. \r\nVery often the solutions that we have found to major \r\ninternational issues — whether geopolitical, economic \r\nor social — are solutions that do not consider people \r\nand that go against one of the themes of the United \r\nNations, the call to leave no one behind.\r\nI therefore view very positively the theme chosen \r\nby the President of the General Assembly, Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés — with whom we also share \r\nthe Ibero-American community — of “Making the \r\nUnited Nations relevant to all people”. And that means \r\nbuilding peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies.\r\nThe action of the United Nations, and by extension \r\nof the entire international community, must be inclusive \r\nand focused on the real problems of people. If we do \r\nnot do that, we would be persevering in our mistakes; \r\nwe would be reinforcing an image of international \r\ninstitutions that are difficult to understand and far \r\nremoved from the concerns of the people, and we would \r\nbe opening the door to populism even wider. That is \r\nwhy Andorra wants to participate in a particularly \r\nactive way in promoting and achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. The Goals are focused on the specific, \r\ntangible needs of the world population. They are major \r\nglobal objectives that have local applications and impact, \r\nand if they are attained, they will reinforce the bonds \r\nthat are so necessary between people and institutions.\r\nAndorra presented its first voluntary national review \r\non the Sustainable Development Goals at the high-\r\nlevel political forum on sustainable development of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council last July. As explained in \r\nthe review, our Government has been working for some \r\ntime on classifying various of its political endeavours \r\naccording to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda. We have also launched a campaign \r\nto involve the education community, civil society and \r\nprivate companies in promoting and achieving the \r\nvarious Goals. That is a way of opening up and bringing \r\nthe United Nations and its agenda closer to the people.\r\nIn our opinion, innovation and the new technologies \r\nplay a very important role in achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. That is why we need a cross-\r\ncutting alliance between the public and the private \r\nsectors so that we can put technological progress in the \r\nservice of the 2030 Agenda.\r\nWe have assessed our performance on six \r\nSustainable Development Goals linked to the \r\nenvironment. They are water and sanitation; clean, \r\naccessible energy; sustainable cities; responsible \r\nconsumption and production; the protection of life on \r\nEarth and the fight against climate change. Various \r\nactions introduced by my Government in recent years \r\nare aimed at those goals — the ongoing improvement \r\nof water and air quality; a comprehensive plan of \r\nenergy transition that has enabled us to reduce our \r\ndependence on outside energy sources by promoting \r\nrenewable energy; direct grants for renewing buildings \r\nusing energy-efficient criteria and so on. All of those \r\nactions are designed to enable us to comply with the \r\n2030 Agenda.\r\nAndorra has also emphasized two more goals, \r\nmeasures to combat climate change and high-quality \r\neducation, because they are two things with which \r\nAndorran society fully identifies. We therefore champion \r\nthe validity of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, \r\nwhich many countries signed here in New York in April \r\n2016, and we insist that the international community \r\nmust comply with the agreements and commitments \r\nmade in Paris in December 2015. We reiterated that \r\nview in Paris last December at the One Planet Summit, \r\npromoted by the Secretary-General and the President \r\nof the French Republic and Co-Prince of Andorra, \r\nMr. Emmanuel Macron. Andorra is working to fulfil \r\nthe commitments of the Paris Agreement and strongly \r\nencourages the rest of the international community to \r\ndo the same.\r\nAs far as quality education is concerned, Andorra is \r\nproud of having a rich, diverse, all-embracing education \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n32/61 18-30104\r\nsystem that is available to all citizens. It is a system in \r\nwhich families can opt for Andorran, Spanish or French \r\neducation at no additional cost. It prepares our young \r\npeople to become citizens of a global world while \r\nremaining deeply rooted in their own identity. That \r\nis perhaps why a great many Andorran international \r\ncooperation efforts focus on the area of education. \r\nWith the financial support of the Government, several \r\nAndorran non-governmental organizations are carrying \r\nout  projects to promote training and opportunities \r\nfor street children in Bolivia, educate young girls in \r\nHonduras and provide schooling for poor children \r\nin Madagascar.\r\nIn choosing the theme for this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly — “Global leadership and shared \r\nresponsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties” — our President has spoken about leadership \r\nand shared responsibilities. That seems to me to be a key \r\nmatter. If we allow the action of the United Nations, and \r\nby extension that of the entire international community, \r\nto move away from people’s real needs, we would be \r\nlosing leadership.\r\nIn the face of the increase in populism and \r\nextremism, political leaders often feel they are \r\nmisunderstood. However, misunderstood leaders do \r\nnot exist, because a misunderstood leader is not a \r\nleader. A leader who does not connect with the people \r\nis not a leader. The United Nations cannot afford the \r\nluxury of disconnecting from the problems, needs, \r\nexpectations and hopes of the citizens of this globalized \r\nworld. Andorra therefore offers its support to the plans \r\nto reform the architecture of the United Nations that \r\nSecretary-General Guterres and his team are carrying \r\nout. More effective management of resources is \r\nessential, particularly with a management focused on \r\npeople. That is crucial.\r\nIn this final part of my statement I would like to \r\ntell a personal anecdote. Seven and a half years ago, I \r\ntook on the responsibility of leading the Government of \r\nthe Principality of Andorra. The ballot boxes bestowed \r\nthat responsibility on me again in March 2015. This \r\nwill therefore be the last time that I address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn Andorra, the entry of the men and women \r\nof my generation into political life coincided with \r\nthe approval of the 1993 Constitution and with the \r\nrecognition of our country as a full member of the \r\ninternational community. I was elected a Member of \r\nParliament in the same year that Andorra became a part \r\nof the United Nations. I am therefore a child of that \r\ntime of optimism that I mentioned at the beginning, a \r\ntime when democracy was expanding, economies were \r\ngrowing, and multilateral institutions were becoming \r\nstronger. However, it was also up to me and the people \r\nof my generation to take on the responsibilities of \r\nGovernment in a time of crisis — economic crisis, \r\nsocial crisis and a crisis in values — at a time when \r\nwhat we believed to be solid and resistant was proving \r\nto be fragile and unstable.\r\nOver time, we have grown accustomed to living \r\nwith that awareness of fragility and instability. When \r\nall is said and done, maybe that is not so bad. Our \r\npredecessors, the previous generations of Andorrans, \r\nwere acutely aware of the fragility of the foundations \r\non which our very old institutions stood. If I compare \r\nthat sense with the spirit of optimism that prevailed \r\n25 years ago, the symbol of our times, the symbol of \r\nthis current moment, is precisely that awareness of the \r\nfragility of the economy, the institutions, the worldwide \r\ngeopolitical order, the environment and the planet as a \r\nwhole. Everything seems to be much more fragile and \r\nin much greater danger now.\r\nMoving from that awareness of fragility, we have \r\nfound the strength to undertake actions that had been \r\nsitting on the table for years and to launch reforms that \r\nhad been pending for decades — seeking a more open, \r\ntransparent and cooperative economy, constructing \r\na more inclusive and all-embracing society, finding \r\nsustainable models of growth and preserving the \r\ninstitutions and values that have been handed down \r\nthrough history, adapting them and making them useful \r\nfor the people of today. Out of necessity we have made \r\na virtue and out of weakness we have found strength \r\nso that the younger generations can take up the reins of \r\ntheir times and do so with the same optimism that we \r\nhad 25 years ago. We must work right through to the last \r\nmoment so that our disappointments can be transformed \r\ninto their hope, so that our mistakes give rise to their \r\nability to prevent them from happening again, and \r\nso that our good choices serve as the foundations on \r\nwhich they can continue to build peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies.\r\nAll of us, the older and the younger generations, \r\nshould always be aware that everything that happens in \r\nthe global area has local repercussions and that all of the \r\nactions that we undertake at the local level contribute \r\nto shaping the global society. Hopefully, it is one that \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 33/61\r\nis fairer in nature, a global society in which everybody \r\nfeels that they are listened to and included. That is a \r\nglobal society to which Andorra — because of its small \r\nsize, but also because of its serenity, which prevails \r\nas a result of centuries of peaceful existence — is \r\nfully committed. The Secretary-General is aware of \r\nthat, as are the President of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-third session and all our friends in the \r\ninternational community.\r\nPoliticians move on. Countries and institutions \r\nremain. I am sure that in the future Member States \r\nwill be able to continue to count on the Principality of \r\nAndorra to assist in building a fairer, safer world. That \r\nis our task.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of Government of \r\nthe Principality of Andorra for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of Government of \r\nthe Principality of Andorra, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by the Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Itaukei Affairs, Sugar Industry and Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Fiji\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Josaia Voreqe \r\nBainimarama, Prime Minister and Minister for Itaukei \r\nAffairs, Sugar Industry and Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Fiji.\r\nMr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Itaukei Affairs, Sugar Industry \r\nand Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Fiji, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Josaia Voreqe \r\nBainimarama, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nItaukei Affairs, Sugar Industry and Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Fiji, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Bainimarama (Fiji): Bula, and a very good day \r\nto all. Allow me to congratulate the President on her \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-third session.\r\nEvery year brings fresh challenges and new \r\ncrises, even as the crises of last year and the year \r\nbefore await some resolution, or even some respite. \r\nThis Organization, the United Nations, is continually \r\nchallenged to stand between parties in conflict, ease \r\nthe suffering of refugees and migrants and continue its \r\nwork to build a more peaceful, just and equal world. The \r\nFijian people have always been proud of our nation’s full \r\nengagement with the United Nations. We have been a \r\nwilling and energetic presence in peacekeeping efforts \r\naround the world, and we are now proudly putting every \r\nounce of energy that we have into the fight to save this \r\nplanet and its people — all of us — from a catastrophic \r\nwarming of our climate.\r\nFiji will soon celebrate national elections for \r\nthe second time since our return to democracy. I say \r\n“celebrate” with a purpose, because truly free elections \r\nare the very starting point for democracy and freedom. \r\nIf the people cannot choose their Government freely, \r\ntheir other freedoms are always in jeopardy.\r\nI am proud of what we have accomplished in our \r\nFijian democracy. The shell of democracy that once \r\nexisted has now been pierced, bringing the Fijian \r\npeople into a genuinely inclusive society in which \r\nminority rights are respected and all citizens are equal, \r\nin name and in fact. That is the great promise of the \r\n2013 Fijian Constitution, which has been the beacon \r\nfor our progress through its vast array of political and \r\nsocioeconomic protections for every Fijian.\r\nToday and forever, in Fiji we make and will make no \r\ndistinctions based on ethnicity, social status or religion, \r\nand we enforce and will enforce our laws guaranteeing \r\nequality. We have reinforced our democracy by passing \r\nlaws to empower girls and women and protect them \r\nfrom violence. We have reformed our education system \r\nso that it provides real opportunities for all Fijians, \r\nregardless of income, gender or whether they live in the \r\ncapital or on the most remote islands.\r\nThis year we achieved a literacy level of over 90 per \r\ncent. More than 90 per cent of girls in Fiji complete 15 \r\nyears of secondary education and just under 90 per cent \r\nof our boys do the same. We are building our future on \r\nthat firm foundation of education.\r\nWe have also reformed our welfare programmes not \r\nonly to provide a stronger safety net but also to create \r\ngreater opportunities for the most vulnerable in our \r\nsociety. While we provide free medicines and subsidized \r\nelectricity, we also award grants to micro-businesses as \r\na way of lifting people out of poverty and rewarding \r\nand encouraging self-reliance and entrepreneurship.\r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n34/61 18-30104\r\nThat approach goes beyond mere Government \r\nprogrammes for the disadvantaged. It is based on the \r\nfundamental principle that the socioeconomic rights of \r\nall Fijians must be protected. They include the right to \r\na high-quality education, the right to receive treatment \r\nand medication when our people are ill, the right to \r\ndecent housing, the right to clean water and electricity, \r\nand the right to affordable and accessible transportation.\r\nWe have also strengthened our independent \r\ninstitutions — our judiciary and the independent \r\ncommissions that protect consumers, fight corruption, \r\nprovide legal assistance, advocate and promote human \r\nrights and carry out many Government activities that \r\nmust be free of political considerations. I may be \r\ndisappointed when my Government loses a case in \r\ncourt, but those defeats are signs of strong, independent \r\ninstitutions, which we must support and reinforce. They \r\nserve to strengthen the people’s belief that everyone in \r\nFiji can get justice. If people believe in the courts, they \r\nwill go to the courts to settle their disputes and trust the \r\ncourts to adjudicate without fear or favour.\r\nThere is no doubt that the Fijian people have a \r\nstrong and abiding love for freedom. We want to live \r\nfreely, and we see freedom, democracy and, perhaps \r\nmost important of all, tolerance as powerful forces for \r\npeace in the world. It is with that clearly demonstrated \r\nvocation for personal freedom, tolerance and social \r\njustice that Fiji is running as a candidate for membership \r\nin the Human Rights Council during this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We have thought hard about human \r\nrights and have taken actions to be a better nation — a \r\nnation that encourages respect for the dignity of every \r\nperson. We look forward to bringing that point of view \r\nto the critical work of the Council.\r\nFiji looks to a future free of racism, nepotism and \r\nprivilege, a future where the rights of all persons are \r\nguaranteed and enforced by a robust constitutional \r\nframework that reaffirms and protects civil and political \r\nrights, as well as social, cultural and economic rights.\r\nOur value to the Human Rights Council is also \r\nunderpinned by our long experience in peacekeeping. \r\nIt was exactly 40 years ago that Fiji first participated \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping. Over those 40 years, \r\nwhich have seen Fijians serving in Africa, the Sinai, \r\nEast Timor and throughout the Middle East, we have \r\ncome to identify ourselves as a peacekeeping nation, \r\nwhich makes us proud. That is something that we offer \r\nto the global community and our fellow human beings.\r\nMoreover, over those 40 years we have witnessed \r\nat first hand the way intolerance embraces and leads \r\nto repression, violence and mass migration. We have \r\nexperienced intolerance in Fiji, which was an ugly \r\nexperience that corroded our trust in each other and our \r\nsense of who we are as a people. We must remember \r\nthat experience so that we do not repeat it, and we will \r\nnever stop working to ensure that it stays in our past.\r\nI am proud to stand before the Assembly and \r\nreport that Fiji is in its ninth year of strong economic \r\ngrowth. I believe that that is due in no small part to \r\nthe democratization that has taken root in our country \r\nand is f lourishing. Democracy is based on a belief \r\nin the people and the belief that everyone is capable \r\nof great things if they are given equal opportunity. \r\nWhen people see that they have opportunities, can \r\nobtain justice, speak their minds and be heard, and \r\nthat their hard work will be rewarded, they invest their \r\nmoney and their sweat in their future and in greater \r\npossibilities for their children. They stay at home and \r\ncontribute rather than emigrating, and they feel free to \r\nlet their hopes and ambitions soar. That is what drives \r\na thriving economy.\r\nHowever, that optimism must be nurtured and \r\nsupported through intelligent Government action. In \r\nFiji we have reformed the tax laws to make them simpler \r\nand more just. In that connection, we have begun to \r\nrigorously enforce our tax laws to ease the burden on \r\nthose who have little and to ensure that whoever should \r\npay pays a fair share. People who take risks and mount \r\nsuccessful businesses should enjoy the fruits of their \r\nhard work, but they must also do their part to sustain the \r\nnation. Tax cheating is an offence against the people, \r\nand we will root it out and penalize it wherever it exists.\r\nWe have also reformed our State enterprises to \r\nmake them profitable and efficient. The people of \r\nFiji and the employees of those companies have been \r\nthe main beneficiaries, because better capitalization \r\nand better management has produced better services, \r\nincreased investments and higher wages.\r\nWe also see small and medium-sized enterprises as \r\nimportant ways of promoting growth and lifting people \r\nout of poverty. I am proud to say that my Government \r\nhas given grants worth $32.4 million to small and \r\nmicro-enterprises, and we have been rewarded with \r\nexplosive growth and extraordinary innovation in that \r\nsector. Free people need an economic structure that \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 35/61\r\nserves them and makes them optimistic. That is one of \r\nthe basic pillars of democracy.\r\nFiji is coming to the end of its presidency of the \r\ntwenty-third session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange (COP-23), part of the United Nations ongoing \r\nclimate negotiations among the nations of the world, \r\nbut the struggle to fight global warming and end the \r\ndegradation of our oceans will continue to be Fiji’s \r\nhighest priority. The many disastrous effects of climate \r\nchange that we are seeing in the South Pacific and \r\naround the world are well documented. The same can \r\nbe said of the enormous stresses on our oceans arising \r\nfrom acidification, overfishing, warming and plastic \r\nrefuse. The time to debate those facts is long past.\r\nAs the Fijian Prime Minister, I have met thousands \r\nof Fijian women, men and children every year who \r\nhave suffered from the latest wave of climate-related \r\nimpacts, such as cyclones, f looding, prolonged droughts \r\nand steadily rising seas. I have met with farmers whose \r\ncrops have been washed away, teachers and students \r\nwho have lost their schools, and families whose homes \r\nhave been destroyed. They want their Prime Minister to \r\ndemand that the world take action on their behalf.\r\nThe commitments that we have all made through \r\nour nationally determined contributions fall woefully \r\nshort of the mark. They simply will not get us to the goal \r\nagreed in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, that \r\nof reducing the rate of global warming to well below the \r\n2°C target, let alone the more ambitious target of 1.5°C. \r\nWhat matters now is action. Fiji will press for more \r\naction on climate change and ocean health in every \r\nforum that it is a part of. We cannot simply wait for the \r\nrest of the world to come around, because the effects of \r\nclimate change are already bearing down on us.\r\nWe are already taking steps to boost our resilience. \r\nFiji has begun a project to improve access to sustainable \r\nwater supplies and sewerage services for approximately \r\n270,000 Fijians. We will provide cyclone insurance \r\ncoverage for low-income households. We are relocating \r\nentire villages and communities to escape the rising \r\nseas. Following the cyclones, we are rebuilding our \r\ninfrastructure to a higher and far more resilient \r\nstandard. We are working to protect communities that \r\nface unacceptably high risks of f looding. Fiji also \r\nbecame the first emerging market to issue a sovereign \r\ngreen bond to fund such activities.\r\nHowever, no Government can combat climate \r\nchange alone. The challenge is simply too great. That is \r\nwhy, from the beginning of Fiji’s presidency of COP-23, \r\nI have sought to build a grand coalition of Governments, \r\nthe private sector, labour forces, religious groups and \r\ncivil society to take initiatives and come up with ideas \r\nand solutions, both great and small.\r\nI am confident that I speak for all Fijians and \r\nPacific islanders when I say that I tend to lose patience \r\nwith national leaders who proclaim their deep concern \r\nover climate change and then do little or nothing to lead \r\ntheir nations onto a more ambitious path for reducing \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions. Leaders who ignore that \r\nthreat and give their people new coal-fired power \r\nplants instead of a better future for their children are \r\neither tragically short-sighted or simply engaging in a \r\nmost cynical form of betrayal. And their people — all \r\npeople — will bear the burden.\r\nThe world has embraced the Pacific tradition of \r\ntalanoa, a tradition of open and honest dialogue. That \r\nwill help to raise our collective ambition. But ambition \r\nwithout action and without a plan is just talk. The \r\nTalanoa Dialogue will reach a crescendo in Katowice, \r\nPoland, at COP-24. We cannot let Katowice fail. \r\nKatowice must not became another Copenhagen.\r\nWe are not only calling on others to act, we are also \r\nleading from the front. Earlier this week I announced \r\nthat Fiji will commit to significantly raising its \r\nnationally determined contribution. Fiji will be a net-\r\nzero greenhouse-gas-emission country by 2050. Fiji is \r\nproud to have launched the Ocean Pathway Partnership \r\nwith the Government of Sweden. We know that the \r\ninteraction of ocean ecology and climate change runs \r\ndeep. We cannot attempt to solve the crisis of one \r\nwithout confronting the crisis of the other. Our oceans \r\nare suffering from the stress of human activities, which \r\ngoes beyond climate change and includes pollution, \r\noverfishing and acidification.\r\nI want to draw the world’s serious attention to the \r\nneed to help developing nations, particularly the most \r\ndisadvantaged and vulnerable, to overcome climate \r\nand oceans stresses. We need access to finance and \r\npractical solutions, and we need the United Nations to \r\nhelp us get there. It has been an honour for Fiji, and \r\nfor me personally, to lead the United Nations efforts on \r\nclimate change this year. I am proud of what we have \r\naccomplished. The world has never needed the United \r\nNations more. The existential problem of climate \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n36/61 18-30104\r\nchange requires us to work together, the challenge of \r\nmobilizing finance for climate resilience requires us to \r\nwork together, and more complex and more globalized \r\nconflicts require us to work together.\r\nFiji is firmly committed to the United Nations. We \r\nneed the United Nations to be at its best if we are to \r\nhave any chance of overcoming the grave challenges \r\nthat Fiji and the world now confront.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Itaukei Affairs, Sugar Industry and Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Fiji for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Itaukei Affairs, Sugar Industry \r\nand Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Fiji, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Alexis Tsipras, \r\nPrime Minister of the Hellenic Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nHellenic Republic.\r\nMr. Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of the Hellenic \r\nRepublic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Alexis Tsipras, Prime \r\nMinister of the Hellenic Republic, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Tsipras (Greece) (spoke in Greek; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): Three \r\nyears ago, when I first had the honour of addressing \r\nthe General Assembly in a plenary meeting (see A/70/\r\nPV.22), I emphasized that Greece was at the forefront \r\nof three overlapping international crises. Those crises \r\nhave had a severe impact on Greek society, its economy \r\nand the country’s diplomatic role in the region.\r\nGreece was the country most hard hit by the \r\neurozone crisis, losing 25 per cent of its gross domestic \r\nproduct, reaching more than 27 per cent unemployment \r\nand significant levels of poverty. Greece was also the \r\nEuropean country that, from a per-capita point of view, \r\ncarried the heaviest burden of the refugee crisis, as over \r\n1.2 million people entered its islands within a period \r\nof a few months. Greece also found itself at the centre \r\nof a worsening crisis of destabilization in the Balkans \r\nand the eastern Mediterranean, with nationalism \r\ngrowing rapidly.\r\nThe question for me at the time of my statement \r\nin 2015, as it was for all of us, was whether the \r\nUnited Nations, the international community and our \r\ninternational institutions would be able to help overcome \r\nthose common challenges through collective solutions. \r\nThe question was whether the European Union (EU), \r\nthe European Central Bank, the International Monetary \r\nFund, the World Trade Organization and the World \r\nBank would guide us to sustainable growth, help \r\ndecrease poverty and promote more balanced global \r\ntrade. The question was whether the EU, the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\nand the International Organization for Migration would \r\nhelp us to effectively and humanely resolve the refugee \r\nand migrant crisis. The question was whether the \r\nUnited Nations, the EU, NATO and the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe would promote \r\npeace and stability, combat international terrorism and \r\nresolve conflicts in my region and many others.\r\nIn the years that followed, however, what came \r\nto the fore was a very big “trust deficit” vis-à-vis \r\ninternational and national institutions, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral called it a few days ago (see A/73/PV.6). In that \r\ncontext, nationalist forces became stronger and stronger \r\nand finally succeeded in reframing the question. Their \r\naggressive stance highlighted the fact that the question \r\nis not whether we can count on international institutions \r\nto solve common problems on the basis of common \r\nvalues, but whether those problems and values are \r\ncommon at all. Their logic in confronting those crises \r\nwas simple and based on a not-in-my-backyard attitude.\r\nFor example, in dealing with the eurozone crisis, \r\nthose forces called for a “Grexit” and the need to make \r\nan example of Greece. In dealing with the refugee crisis, \r\nthey supported the unilateral closure of borders along \r\nthe Balkan route as a solution, demanded push-backs \r\ninto the sea and called for a small Schengen area that \r\nexcluded front-line EU countries. In dealing with crises \r\nin the broader region, the solutions that they proposed \r\nwere also simplistic — sanctions and preventive or \r\nhumanitarian wars, and, when those led to a dead end, \r\ndisengagement from the region and the containment of \r\nproblems to avoid any spillover.\r\nIn Greece, we dynamically confronted not only the \r\nchallenges themselves, but also the ideas and policies \r\nI have mentioned about the problems. Not only did we \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 37/61\r\nmanage to stay standing, overcoming those difficulties, \r\nbut beyond that we also became part of the solution, \r\nrather than part of the problem, in Europe and in the \r\nbroader region. We did that without succumbing to \r\nthe directives of countries, forces and institutions that \r\ndisregarded the will of the Greek people in favour \r\nof their own economic or geopolitical interests and \r\nwithout resorting to nationalist politics that would \r\nlead to a departure from the eurozone, an escalation of \r\ntension with neighbours and a violation of human rights \r\nand international law.\r\nFirst, as regards the economy, we remained in the \r\neurozone but carried out tough negotiations for an \r\neconomic programme that centred on the necessary \r\nstructural reforms and not on the perpetuation of \r\npunitive and exhausting austerity. At the same time, \r\nwe protected labour rights and are now establishing a \r\nrespectable minimum wage, while guaranteeing fiscal \r\nspace to support the welfare State and those who are \r\nmost vulnerable.\r\nToday we have left behind economic programmes \r\nthat only perpetuated recession. Our growth rate has \r\nbeen 2.1 per cent this year, and will be going on 2.5 per \r\ncent next year. Unemployment has fallen by 8 per cent, \r\ntourism has exceeded 34 million visits per year and \r\nwe are overachieving with regard to the size of budget \r\nsurpluses, while investors’ interest is growing steadily. \r\nGreece is becoming a regional energy, commercial and \r\ntransport hub, while also changing the energy map and \r\ndeveloping its strategic assets.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the refugee crisis, we \r\nhave had to deal with the highest refugee f lows in post-\r\nwar European history. We did that while respecting \r\ninternational law and human rights. However, at the \r\nsame time, we supported the difficult, but necessary, \r\nEU-Turkey statement. We did not give in to nationalistic \r\nand xenophobic voices that called for push-backs \r\ninto the sea or a superficial asylum process aimed at \r\nrejecting everyone. However, we also did not hesitate \r\nto accept that those who do not need international \r\nprotection must return to their countries of origin \r\nwhere they can be safe.\r\nWe severely criticized those European countries \r\nthat rejected their responsibility to assume their fair \r\nshare of the burden — countries that call for unity when \r\nit comes to having rights but see things differently when \r\nit comes to fulfilling responsibilities. The people of \r\nGreece, despite their difficulties, opened their arms to \r\nincoming migrants, showing the world what solidarity \r\nmeans. Deaths in the Aegean Sea have nearly reached \r\nzero, and migrant f lows have fallen radically.\r\nThirdly, concerning the security crisis, we \r\nconfronted grave challenges caused by rapid \r\ndestabilization, the strengthening of nationalism and \r\nincreasing tensions in a region in which we already \r\nhad stark differences with neighbouring countries. In \r\nthat geopolitical context, Greece retained a policy of \r\nprotecting its sovereign rights and interests. However, \r\nat the same time, it chose to become, together with \r\nCyprus, the most important European pillar of peace, \r\nsecurity and stability in the region.\r\nWe have established dynamic trilateral schemes of \r\ncooperation with Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and \r\nPalestine. We also clearly presented the message that \r\ndialogue, cooperation and respect for international law \r\nare the only ways to foster stable bilateral relations \r\nand strengthen the prospects for the region. Moreover, \r\nwe remained committed to that policy in our difficult \r\nrelations with Turkey, refusing again and again to give \r\nin to nationalism and the escalation of tensions. That \r\nposition allowed us to show the great potential for our \r\nrelations in the areas of security, migration, energy \r\nand the economy, while also making clear the need \r\nfor respect for international law in the Aegean and the \r\neastern Mediterranean.\r\nIn that context, we clearly expressed and continue \r\nto express our full support for a just and viable solution \r\nto the Cyprus issue, on the basis of United Nations \r\ndecisions. The solution will be based on the framework \r\nof the Secretary-General and our important Crans-\r\nMontana negotiations.\r\nMoreover, we are actively promoting stability and \r\neconomic growth in the Balkans through a policy of \r\nresolving issues with our neighbours, which unlocks \r\ntheir potential to join the EU and other international \r\norganizations of their choice. One example would be \r\nour dialogue with Albania, but, most importantly, \r\nthe Prespes agreement with our immediate northern \r\nneighbour. That agreement is important not only for the \r\nregion, but also as a model for the peaceful resolution \r\nof differences. Moreover, the agreement did not come \r\nabout through the stronger party’s imposition of its \r\nwill and interests on the other, but through a mutually \r\nacceptable arrangement that preserves the dignity of \r\nboth sides.\r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n38/61 18-30104\r\nI think that today it is high time that we, as an \r\ninternational community, reframed the questions \r\nfor our future, because we have heard many \r\nimportant statements. The dilemma is not one of \r\npatriotism versus globalism. It is rather whether we \r\nwill leave our world in a vicious circle of nationalist \r\nreaction and regression, which history has taught us \r\nleads to tragedy, or create the conditions for collective, \r\nprogressive solutions that respect the national and \r\npopular sovereignty of each and every country.\r\nModern, democratic, patriotic politics cannot mean \r\npassively accepting the directives of transnational \r\nelites who are accountable to no one. Modern, \r\ndemocratic, patriotic politics cannot accept as a given \r\nan international order that reproduces inequalities of \r\npower and wealth, protects the rights of some to have \r\nenormous trade surpluses at the expense of others, \r\nor allows some countries to impose their will and \r\ninterests on others in the name of common values no \r\nless. That is our position with regard to the eurozone, to \r\nhumanitarian wars in the region and to our differences \r\nwith our neighbours.\r\nOn the other hand, modern, democratic, patriotic \r\npolitics has to be able to deal with twenty-first-century \r\nglobal and regional challenges, challenges that are \r\ncommon by their very nature and can only be dealt \r\nwith collectively, on the basis of shared values. We \r\nbelieve that modern, democratic, patriotic politics must \r\nbe based on collective arrangements and guarantees \r\nthat preserve and promote peace, stability, sustainable \r\ngrowth and human rights, and that they should not \r\nbe based on a logic of unilateralism, nationalism and \r\nstrengthening the powerful over the weak.\r\nThat means making sure that international \r\norganizations, including financial ones, become more \r\naccountable and respond to the actual needs of States \r\nand citizens. It means supporting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s vision for United Nations reform, as well \r\nas the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nthe coming global compact on migration, the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change and the Iran nuclear \r\ndeal, despite all of its weaknesses.\r\nIt means finding a political solution in Syria on the \r\nbasis of an inclusive political dialogue under United \r\nNations auspices, and revitalizing the Middle East \r\npeace process towards a comprehensive solution that \r\nresponds to Israel’s just demand for security and the \r\nPalestinians’ just demand for a State on the basis of the \r\n1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nIt means promoting valuable dialogue among \r\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic institutions and member \r\nStates with Russia, on the basis of mutual respect and \r\nwith the goal of dealing with international challenges \r\nand regional crises. It means promoting peace and \r\ndevelopment in Africa, supporting the countries that \r\ncarry the biggest burden in hosting refugees, such as \r\nTurkey, Lebanon and Jordan, and confronting the root \r\ncauses of migration. It means supporting positive steps \r\nfor a diplomatic solution to denuclearization on the \r\nKorean peninsula.\r\nLastly, particularly as we celebrate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, it means advancing the human rights agenda, \r\nwhich Greece has done, after all, by granting \r\ncitizenship to second-generation immigrants who were \r\nborn and raised in our country, by establishing the legal \r\nrecognition of gender identity and the institutionalization \r\nof civil partnership and by deepening the rights of the \r\nMuslim minority.\r\nThis year we are celebrating the 100th anniversary \r\nof the birth of Nelson Mandela, who once said that \r\ntasks always seem impossible until they are done. For \r\nthe last eight years my country has been hit hard by \r\nthree global crises. We decisively confronted the logic \r\nthat countries affected by global challenges must deal \r\nwith them alone. Today, although Greece still faces \r\nbig challenges in its economy, migration management \r\nand diplomacy, it is again standing on its feet, bringing \r\nsolutions to the region. That would not have happened \r\nwithout a politics that asserts popular and national \r\nsovereignty but also commits to collective solutions \r\naimed at peace, stability and preserving human rights.\r\nThe challenge for our time is to once again find \r\nthe proper balance as an international community, \r\nconfronting international forces that spread fear \r\nand hatred and that in the end seek to scale back the \r\nprogress we have made. That is a genuinely modern, \r\ndemocratic and patriotic choice — one whose aim will \r\nbe to ensure that our countries progress and prosper, \r\nrather than become pitted against each other.\r\nIn conclusion, the civilization of my country leaves \r\nno space for doubting the choice that we will support. \r\nI assure the Assembly that the Greek people will be \r\nstanding once again, and as always, on the right side \r\nof history.\r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 39/61\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nHellenic Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of the Hellenic \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Home Affairs, External \r\nCommunications and National Development \r\nUnit, Minister for Finance and Economic \r\nDevelopment of the Republic of Mauritius\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nHome Affairs, External Communications and National \r\nDevelopment Unit, Minister for Finance and Economic \r\nDevelopment of the Republic of Mauritius.\r\nMr. Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Home Affairs, External \r\nCommunications and National Development Unit, \r\nMinister for Finance and Economic Development \r\nof the Republic of Mauritius, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Pravind Kumar \r\nJugnauth, Prime Minister, Minister for Home Affairs, \r\nExternal Communications and National Development \r\nUnit, Minister for Finance and Economic Development \r\nof the Republic of Mauritius, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Jugnauth (Mauritius): Let me join other \r\nleaders in paying special tribute to the late Kofi Annan, \r\nformer Secretary-General of the United Nations. The \r\nlegacy left by that great son of Africa will forever \r\nremain carved in the history of the United Nations.\r\nI warmly congratulate Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés on her election as the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session, and I \r\nwant to assure her of our full support in her work. I also \r\nthank Mr. Miroslav Lajčák for his dedicated and able \r\nleadership, relentless commitment to multilateralism \r\nand continued engagement with Member States during \r\nhis presidency.\r\nThe year 2018 is a special year for Mauritius, as \r\nit marks the fiftieth anniversary of our independence. \r\nWe also celebrate, with immense pride and honour, 50 \r\nyears of membership in this body. The theme for this \r\nsession, “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”, is both \r\napt and timely.\r\nWe are living in troubled times that are marked by \r\nuncertainty and complex threats to the peace, stability \r\nand sustainability of our planet. Increased international \r\ntensions, intractable conflicts, expanding pockets of \r\npoverty throughout the world, growing inequalities, \r\nthe deterioration of the oceans, climate change, violent \r\nextremism and terrorism, nationalism, cyberthreats, \r\nescalating militarization and forced migration are \r\nonly some of the perils that endanger global peace \r\nand security. These challenges cannot be overcome \r\nwithout greater cooperation, global leadership and \r\nshared responsibilities.\r\nMs. Scott (Namibia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nWe wholeheartedly welcome the reform process \r\nto make the United Nations fit for purpose, closer \r\nto and more consonant with the people it serves and \r\nbetter equipped to bring about the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, so that \r\nno one, irrespective of race or gender, is left behind. \r\nMy Government remains fully committed to the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. In that regard, \r\nMauritius will present its voluntary national review \r\nat the 2019 high-level political forum on sustainable \r\ndevelopment next July.\r\nThe SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action \r\n(SAMOA) Pathway remains a valid road map for us \r\nto measure how much progress has been achieved in \r\naddressing the challenges and difficulties faced by \r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS), including climate \r\nchange. We welcome the holding of the mid-term review \r\nof the SAMOA Pathway next September, and we call on \r\nall stakeholders to participate at the highest level, in \r\norder to assist SIDS in strengthening their resilience.\r\nThe stark effects of climate change are being felt \r\nall around the world. As we have seen in California, the \r\nCarolinas, the Philippines, China, Europe and elsewhere, \r\nthe frequency of extreme weather events demonstrates \r\nthat climate change can affect every country on \r\nevery continent. Hurricanes, f loods, droughts and \r\nwildfires are becoming deadlier, and weather patterns \r\nmore severe. These disasters are sounding the alarm. \r\nWithout a renewed global commitment to undertaking \r\nambitious efforts aimed at combating climate change \r\nand adapting to its effects, we will fail to meet the \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n40/61 18-30104\r\ntargets of the Paris Agreement and endanger our planet, \r\nas well as our own survival.\r\nWe cannot dissociate the climate from our oceans. \r\nOur planet’s future also depends on our ability to \r\nfurther protect the oceans and increase their ability to \r\nact as a buffer against climate change. We need global \r\nleadership and enhanced multilateral cooperation to \r\nsafeguard the ocean and its role as the natural weather \r\nregulator of our planet.\r\nAs a large ocean State that respects the rule of law \r\nand international law, Mauritius has taken the lead in \r\nthe western Indian Ocean region in combating piracy \r\nand other transnational organized crimes and in keeping \r\nits territory and surrounding areas safe. As Chair of \r\nthe Indian Ocean Commission, Mauritius co-hosted \r\nwith the Commission a ministerial conference on \r\nmaritime security in April to coordinate actions to \r\nfight transnational organized crimes, such as drug \r\ntrafficking, piracy and human trafficking. In doing so, \r\nwe have consolidated our engagement with the United \r\nNations system, in particular, the United Nations Office \r\non Drugs and Crime and the Department of Political \r\nAffairs, with which we recently signed a memorandum \r\nof understanding to assist the Indian Ocean region in \r\nfighting these security threats and challenges.\r\nWe are equally concerned about the situation in \r\nthe Middle East, where the scourge of violence and \r\nwar continues to claim innocent lives. Peace in that \r\nregion will remain elusive as long as the international \r\ncommunity does not live up to its legal and moral \r\nresponsibilities to uphold international law. Mauritius \r\ntherefore reiterates its call for renewed and genuine \r\ninternational efforts in favour of negotiations towards \r\nthe speedy realization of a two-State solution, with \r\nan independent and viable Palestine existing side by \r\nside and at peace with the State of Israel. While we \r\nwait for this to happen, it is extremely important that \r\nthe suffering of the people, especially women and \r\nchildren, is alleviated through renewed and increased \r\ninternational support.\r\nDespite all the current efforts, terrorism remains \r\na painful reality, claiming numerous lives daily and \r\nthreatening world peace and development. It is urgent \r\nthat we build consensus on global counter-terrorism \r\nefforts and reinforce multilateral cooperation in \r\nfighting this scourge. Indeed, we must pay attention \r\nto why individuals are attracted to violent extremist \r\ngroups. We believe firmly that the creation of open, \r\nequitable, inclusive and pluralist societies, based on \r\nthe full respect of human rights and with education \r\nand economic opportunities for all, represents the most \r\neffective way to ending violent extremism.\r\nIn that same vein, we need to reinforce global \r\nnon-proliferation regimes. The continued existence of \r\nnuclear arsenals and the threat of a nuclear disaster \r\nrepresents a major impediment to the maintenance of \r\npeace and security. We must also remain vigilant with \r\nregard to the cyberthreats that endanger our national \r\nsecurity. As highlighted in the new disarmament agenda \r\nthat the Secretary-General presented in May, we must \r\ncreate secure physical and cyberzones in space, on \r\nland and on the seas, and we need to do whatever is \r\nnecessary to make our planet a safe place for all.\r\nDrug trafficking and unregulated drug \r\nconsumption have the potential to destroy the future of \r\nour young people. We are all too well aware of how \r\ndrugs undermine sustainable human development \r\nand the stability of countries and whole regions. \r\nMy Government remains determined to fight drug \r\ntrafficking. In that regard, our commission of inquiry \r\non drug trafficking, set up to inquire on all aspects of \r\ndrug trafficking in Mauritius, has recently submitted its \r\nfindings. I have set up a ministerial committee to look \r\ninto its recommendations, which include strengthening \r\nthe existing institutional framework and reviewing the \r\nrelevant legislation. To address the evolving challenges \r\nof drugs, my country has committed to the Global Call \r\nto Action on the World Drug Problem. More than ever, \r\nwe need closer cooperation to address this scourge.\r\nWe must be careful not to undermine the \r\nmultilateral system, as it has served the community of \r\nnations well. The United Nations was created to bring \r\nStates together. It also established conditions under \r\nwhich justice and respect for the law can be maintained \r\nand strengthened.\r\nConscious of the responsibility of belonging to the \r\nAssembly, my country made a pledge at its admission in \r\n1968 to uphold the great ideals that are enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We gave the assurance \r\nthat we would bring our contribution, however modest \r\nit might be, to shaping the destiny of a better world.\r\nAs a responsible member of this community of \r\nnations, Mauritius has remained true to that pledge. \r\nToday I reaffirm my country’s continued commitment to \r\nthe ideals and values of the Organization, its respect for \r\ninternational law and faith in international partnership \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 41/61\r\nso as to build a safer and more prosperous world. It is \r\nwith this commitment that Mauritius subscribes to the \r\nglobal compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, \r\nand we look forward to its adoption in Marrakech \r\nin December.\r\nIn the same spirit of upholding the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, and based on their commitment to the \r\ninternational rule of law, in June 2017 member States of \r\nthe Group of African States introduced draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.73, requesting an advisory opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice on the legal consequences \r\nof the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from \r\nMauritius in 1965. At the heart of this request for \r\nan advisory opinion is the issue of decolonization, a \r\nmatter of international public order under the Charter \r\nand a central element of the work of the United Nations \r\nand General Assembly. To date, the decolonization of \r\nMauritius remains incomplete, thanks to the unlawful \r\nexcision of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius \r\nprior to its accession to independence.\r\nThe hearings at the Court have been completed, and \r\nthe judges will now deliberate on a matter that has raised \r\nimportant issues relating to decolonization and human \r\nrights, particularly the right to self-determination of \r\nthe people of Mauritius and the plight of Mauritians of \r\nChagossian origin who were forcibly removed from the \r\nChagos Archipelago. The advisory opinion will also \r\nfurther clarify and strengthen the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level at a time when such strengthening \r\nis greatly needed. I want to take this opportunity \r\nto express my Government’s appreciation to all the \r\nmember States of the African Union that have actively \r\nparticipated in the written and oral proceedings of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice relating to this matter.\r\nThe United Nations is and will always be at the \r\ncentre of all action for sustainable development, peace \r\nand security. While we applaud the three-pronged \r\nreform of the United Nations led by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, considerable resources will be required \r\nto match this ambition. We therefore appeal to all \r\nstakeholders to be generous in supporting the reform \r\nby providing adequate resources on a predictable basis. \r\nWe also appeal for a special consideration of Africa’s \r\nneeds and priorities in the restructuring of the peace \r\nand security architecture.\r\nWe commend the efforts of the Secretary-General \r\naimed at enhancing the framework of cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the African Union, \r\nwhich is so vital to sustained peace and development \r\non the continent. Africa’s growth is showing promising \r\nsigns of rebounding, and several countries are already \r\nundergoing positive transitions. Elections in Africa \r\nduring the last several years demonstrate that African \r\ncountries have strengthened their democracies, while \r\nensuring a peaceful transition of power. We welcomed \r\nthe signing of a historical peace agreement between \r\nEthiopia and Eritrea ending two decades of tension \r\nthat followed years of open conflict, causing the loss \r\nof thousands of lives. The improved political climate, \r\nreconciliation efforts and inclusive participation rights \r\nherald a new age of governance that deserves to be \r\nsupported by the international community.\r\nOne aspect of United Nations reform where we find \r\nprogress wanting is in the collective aspiration for a \r\nstrengthened and more legitimate Security Council that \r\nreflects today’s reality. We once again call for reform of \r\nthe Security Council and repeat our plea for the start of \r\na text-based negotiation. We all agree that an equitable \r\nrepresentation of Africa on the Security Council will \r\nnot only redress a gross historical injustice but also \r\nrender the Council more democratic and representative. \r\nWe also support India’s legitimate aspiration for a \r\npermanent seat in an enlarged Security Council and a \r\nnon-permanent seat for small island developing States.\r\nFour days ago we celebrated the memory and legacy \r\nof one of Africa’s most illustrious leaders, Nelson \r\nMandela (see A/73/PV.4 et seq.). As world leaders, we \r\nwould benefit from being inspired by the words and \r\nactions of Mandela, especially when he said:\r\n“What counts in life is not the mere fact that we \r\nhave lived. It is what difference we have made to the \r\nlives of others that will determine the significance \r\nof the life we lead.”\r\nTogether we can make that difference.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister \r\nfor Home Affairs, External Communications and \r\nNational Development Unit, Minister for Finance and \r\nEconomic Development of the Republic of Mauritius \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Home Affairs, External \r\nCommunications and National Development Unit, \r\nMinister for Finance and Economic Development \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n42/61 18-30104\r\nof the Republic of Mauritius, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Duško Marković, Prime Minister \r\nof Montenegro\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Montenegro.\r\nMr. Duško Marković, Prime Minister of \r\nMontenegro, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Duško Marković, Prime \r\nMinister of Montenegro, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Marković (Montenegro) (spoke in Montenegrin; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is my \r\npleasure to address the General Assembly on behalf \r\nof Montenegro, one of the youngest members of the \r\nUnited Nations, which, since the restoration of its \r\nstatehood 12 years ago, has clearly and unequivocally \r\nconfirmed its commitment to joint action within the \r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to congratulate Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés of Ecuador on her election \r\nas the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session, and to wish her success in carrying out \r\nthe responsibilities and duties of the post. I also want \r\nto thank the President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, for his \r\noutstanding leadership and contribution to strengthening \r\nthe role of the General Assembly and stepping up \r\ndialogue with Member States. I congratulate him on \r\nanother job well done, and express gratitude for the \r\nlasting friendship he has shown towards Montenegro.\r\nI welcome the theme chosen for the general \r\ndebate of the seventy-third session. I firmly believe \r\nthat in these challenging times concerted action and \r\nshared responsibility for peaceful, just and sustainable \r\nsocieties are the right and only way towards achieving \r\nour goal of making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople on the planet.\r\nGiven the complex situations and challenges that \r\nthe world is facing, the grave divisions for numerous \r\nreasons, the catastrophic consequences of the spread \r\nof terrorism and violent extremism, as well as climate \r\nchange, there is no question that only through joint \r\naction can we succeed in resolving conflicts and \r\npreventing the further suffering of innocent people. \r\nThe historic multilateral agreements that we have made \r\nin recent times show what we can do through joint \r\naction. These agreements, primarily the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement \r\nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change, envisage our common future and \r\nconfirm that multilateralism is not an option but the \r\nonly effective tool in our toolbox.\r\nFor the full implementation of the adopted \r\nagreements, reforming the United Nations and \r\nstrengthening its central role in multilateralism \r\nare more necessary than ever. This seventy-third \r\nsession is therefore of paramount importance for \r\nrestoring confidence in the United Nations. Indeed, \r\nnotwithstanding the sometimes justified criticism \r\ndirected at the Organization, it is capable of achieving \r\nthe noble objectives for which it was founded. It cannot \r\nbe said that these lofty goals have been achieved in \r\ntoday’s world, but neither do we have to hide that fact. \r\nWe must look the problem in the eye and assume our \r\nshare of responsibility for the state of today’s — and \r\ntomorrow’s — world.\r\nMontenegro strongly supports the United Nations \r\nreform process. I am confident that the issue of \r\nfragmentation within the Organization can be settled \r\nby strengthening the linkages among all three pillars of \r\naction and by promoting greater transparency, efficiency \r\nand accountability. I believe that the implementation of \r\nthe complex reform agenda, coupled with the strong \r\nleadership of Secretary-General Guterres, will result \r\nin a more efficient Organization and contribute to \r\nreducing suffering throughout the world and ensuring \r\ncommon peace, security and prosperity.\r\nI would like to remind the General Assembly of \r\nMontenegro’s views, in a nutshell, on some of the key \r\ntopics on the agenda of this session of the Assembly. \r\nFirst of all, Montenegro is strongly committed to the \r\npolicy underlying the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand the work being done to achieve those Goals, which \r\ncomplement the reforms that we have undertaken in our \r\nEuropean integration process. Furthermore, although \r\nits share in global emissions and population statistics is \r\nsmall, Montenegro is committed to the implementation \r\nof the Paris Climate Agreement through the responsible \r\nand sustainable management of its development \r\npotential. Montenegro welcomes the initiative of the \r\nSecretary-General to hold a climate change summit \r\nin 2019.\r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 43/61\r\nIn terms of finding solutions to conflicts all \r\naround the world, we are aware that the international \r\ncommunity often fails to prevent crime and the \r\nsuffering of many. In addition to what we have learned \r\nfrom the long-standing conflict in Syria, the findings of \r\nthe commission of inquiry into human rights violations \r\nin Myanmar also warn of the importance of prevention \r\nand addressing the causes of instability in a timely \r\nmanner. It is our moral and political responsibility to \r\nprevent impunity for the perpetrators of the crimes \r\ncommitted. In this regard, the role of the Security \r\nCouncil, the International Criminal Court and other \r\ncriminal tribunals is crucial.\r\nMontenegro deplores the stalemate in settling the \r\nlong-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the lack \r\nof progress in resolving the worsening humanitarian \r\nsituation in the Gaza Strip. Today we call on all parties \r\nto uphold international law and refrain from unilateral \r\nactions that weaken confidence and make it difficult \r\nto reach a mutually acceptable peace agreement. We \r\nstrongly support the resumption of negotiations and the \r\nuse of mediation in striving to reach a peaceful solution.\r\nConflicts in Syria, Yemen, Libya and other \r\ncountries, as well as the long-standing Palestinian-\r\nIsraeli conflict, require an immediate end to violence, \r\nrespect for international law on the part of all parties \r\nto the conflict and peaceful settlements achieved \r\nthrough diplomatic means as soon as possible. In order \r\nto eradicate terrorism and violent extremism, we must \r\nstep up efforts to strengthen the implementation of the \r\nprevention pillar of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy. The focus of our activities must be \r\non the integration of vulnerable and marginalized groups \r\nand care for young people as the main stakeholders in \r\na better future.\r\nWe strongly support global efforts aimed at \r\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction. I am certain that through the \r\nconsistent application of the relevant treaties on nuclear \r\ndisarmament and arms control, we can achieve a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free world. We therefore support the \r\nactivities of the United States of America, the Republic \r\nof Korea and the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea aimed at ensuring the denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula.\r\nI will now touch on two very important and \r\nintertwined aspects of today’s world: human rights and \r\nhumanitarian challenges.\r\nAny violation of human rights poses a threat to \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law and represents a step \r\ntowards possible conflict. At a time when we are \r\ncommemorating the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, the twenty-fifth of the adoption of the Vienna \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action and the twentieth \r\nof the adoption of the Declaration on Human Rights \r\nDefenders, we are witnessing an increasing number of \r\nexamples of grave human rights violations around the \r\nworld. It is unacceptable that we remain silent about this \r\nfact. In addressing these situations, we acknowledge \r\nthe important role of the Human Rights Council and \r\nthe need for it to be more efficient and effective in its \r\nfunctions in order to build on the results achieved so \r\nfar. A strong and determined commitment to taking \r\na progressive approach to human rights is necessary, \r\nas is improving our record in adhering to the highest \r\nstandards at all levels.\r\nWith respect to the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights at the national level, significant progress \r\nhas been made in the protection of women, children and \r\nthe lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations, \r\nand in the integration of marginalized groups. We \r\naim to strengthen and expand our national human \r\nrights dialogue, which should contribute to improved \r\nadherence to international standards. Montenegro’s \r\ncommitment to the issue of gender equality and the fight \r\nagainst violence against women has been reaffirmed \r\nby our chairmanship of the Executive Board of UN-\r\nWomen. We strongly advocate greater roles for women \r\nas leaders, high-level decision-makers and stakeholders \r\nin conflict prevention, resolution and reconciliation.\r\nAlthough humanitarian challenges are on the \r\nrise, I want to emphasize the importance of two key \r\nmultilateral agreements that have arisen under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations, the global compacts \r\non migration and refugees. The adoption of the global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration will \r\ncontribute to the improved management of international \r\nmigration in all dimensions, to the benefit of all States \r\nand communities, including migrants. Our Government \r\nis working in all areas to better regulate migration \r\nprocesses and is doing everything it can to enable the \r\nadmission of migrants and refugees in accordance with \r\ninternational standards in this area, while taking into \r\naccount its own national capacities. Bearing in mind \r\nour experience in admitting a large number of refugees \r\nduring the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s, we have helped \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n44/61 18-30104\r\nto develop the global compact on refugees, which we \r\nbelieve will contribute to the international community’s \r\njoint action to regulate the mass movement of refugees \r\nand provide support to destination countries.\r\nIn the past 12 years, since the restoration of our \r\nindependence, we have made rapid progress in the \r\nState-building process on the basis of lofty democratic \r\nvalues. Our results are not just a product of political \r\npragmatism but a vision of a modern Montenegro \r\ngeared to the stability and prosperity of its citizens.\r\nMontenegro is a new member of NATO, having \r\njoined it last year. We are aware of the necessity for \r\na safe and secure environment and are committed to \r\ndealing with the issues of global security and the \r\npreservation and enhancement of common values \r\nwithin both NATO and United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions. Membership in NATO has given us a strong \r\nincentive to further strengthen the rule of law based on \r\nthe highest democratic values.\r\nAt the same time, we are vigorously implementing \r\neconomic reforms that have resulted in a high economic \r\ngrowth rate of more than 4.5 per cent last year and in \r\nthe first half of this year. The reforms are based on \r\nprinciples of sustainable development that will secure \r\nhigher living standards for our people in the longer term.\r\nAt the moment, Montenegro is a front runner among \r\nthe Western Balkan States engaged in the process of \r\njoining the European Union. Among other things, we \r\nhave earned this position because multinational and \r\nmultireligious harmony has been a historical feature of \r\nour country and our greatest value. We are committed \r\nto strengthening institutions and making them \r\nsustainable, and are determined to win the fight against \r\norganized crime and corruption.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to draw the \r\nAssembly’s attention to the current situation in my \r\nregion. The Western Balkans is now a better place to \r\nlive than 20 or 30 years ago, owing to the efforts of \r\nthe international community and the Governments of \r\nthe countries of the region. We in Montenegro believe \r\nthat there is no better future for our citizens than \r\nbeing integrated into the European Union. We are also \r\nconfident that this choice is also natural for Europe. In \r\nour view, European values are the best — indeed, the \r\nonly — answer to growing nationalism and populism. \r\nHowever, in order to achieve the goal of furthering \r\nEuropean values, decisive action must be taken based \r\non a clear vision of wholeness, stability and strength in \r\nevery corner of Europe.\r\nMontenegro will remain committed to promoting \r\nregional stability and cooperation and developing good \r\nneighbourly relations. In that regard, we welcome the \r\nsigning of the historic agreement between Macedonia \r\nand Greece, which contributes to broadening the \r\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic perspective of the region. \r\nWe hope for the successful implementation of the \r\nagreement reached, which will be conducive to creating \r\nan environment favourable to the further overall \r\ndevelopment of the region.\r\nWe also welcome the negotiations between Belgrade \r\nand Pristina. We believe that in the coming period it \r\nwill result in the achievement of a lasting agreement \r\nand the full normalization of relations, which is in the \r\ninterest of both the region and Europe.\r\nMontenegro will continue to be a responsible partner \r\nas it works together with the United Nations. Through \r\nits membership in the organs and agencies of the United \r\nNations, it will contribute to United Nations efforts \r\naimed at addressing global challenges. In addition to its \r\nmembership in and chairing of the Executive Board of \r\nUN-Women, Montenegro has submitted its candidacy \r\nfor membership in the Economic and Social Council \r\nfor the period from 2020 to 2022, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the period from 2022 to 2024 and the \r\nSecurity Council for a term from 2026 to 2027.\r\nWe believe that we will gain the support and \r\nconfidence of the States Members of the United \r\nNations in those bodies, which will be an opportunity \r\nto contribute to stronger and more effective United \r\nNations action. The key interests of our countries \r\nare shared — they are greater peace, security and \r\nprosperity for our citizens. In this respect, the United \r\nNations must continue to play a strong role.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nMontenegro for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Duško Marković, Prime Minister of \r\nMontenegro, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 45/61\r\nAddress by Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei \r\nTecho Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Cambodia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Cambodia.\r\nSamdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Samdech Akka Moha Sena \r\nPadei Techo Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Cambodia, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Hun Sen (Cambodia) (spoke in Khmer; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): My participation in the \r\ngeneral debate of the General Assembly at this session \r\nis taking place in a context in which the Cambodian \r\nnation is enjoying dividends of peace, stability and \r\nrapid development that are unprecedented in its \r\nmodern history. Cambodia is an outstanding example \r\nof a war-torn country that has succeeded in completely \r\ntransforming itself in a way that it is proud of.\r\nOnce infamous for its killing fields in a region made \r\nunstable by armed conflicts and dangerous landmines, \r\nCambodia, formerly an economically backward country \r\nmired in poverty and food insecurity, now enjoys full \r\npeace. It has become a popular tourist destination in \r\nSouth-East Asia and a food exporter. It also stands \r\nout for its achievements in poverty reduction and its \r\nimprovements across all social indicators. Cambodia \r\nis recognized as one of the world’s fastest-growing \r\neconomies, having recently successfully graduated \r\nfrom low-income to lower-middle-income status, owing \r\nto its high economic growth, at around 7 per cent per \r\nannum over the past two decades.\r\nDespite being notorious for its history of armed \r\nstruggle for power and multiple changes of Government, \r\nCambodia is now governed by the rule of law and firmly \r\nrespects multiparty liberal democracy, with regular, free \r\nand fair elections that enable its people to choose their \r\ncountry’s leadership. In Cambodia’s general election \r\nfor electing members of the sixth National Assembly in \r\nJuly, nearly 7 million Cambodians, or 83.02 per cent of \r\nregistered voters, cast their votes and freely expressed \r\ntheir political choices without coercion, threat or \r\nviolence. Twenty registered political parties ran in the \r\nelection, which clearly demonstrated the legitimacy of \r\nour pluralist politics and reflected what was described \r\nby thousands of domestic and international observers \r\nin Cambodia as a stable democratic process in the form \r\nof a free, fair and credible election.\r\nBy their votes, Cambodians reaffirmed their \r\ndesire for peace, stability and long-lasting sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Indeed, neither the free choice of the \r\nCambodian people nor the legitimate result of the \r\nelection is a subject for question or debate. In some \r\noutside circles, however, where an ambition to interfere \r\nin the domestic affairs of Cambodia has been nourished, \r\nquestions about the quality and integrity of our election \r\nprocess have been raised in statements that attack the \r\noutcome of the election. Such actions are a serious \r\nassault on the will of the Cambodian people.\r\nI would like to draw the attention of all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to the vitality of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We must all give the \r\nproper respect to that crucial document by avoiding \r\ninterference in or damage or disruption to the sovereignty \r\nof independent States. We regretfully have to highlight \r\nthe fact that the issue of human rights nowadays has \r\nbecome the way some powerful nations strive to \r\nimpose civilization on other nations, or, according to \r\ntheir operating standards, as a pretext for interfering \r\nin the name of protecting political rights. As a result, \r\nthe imposition of unilateral sanctions has become a \r\npopular weapon that powerful nations use to manage \r\ntheir international politics, which are completely driven \r\nby their geopolitical agendas.\r\nThat is nothing more than the use of brutal force by \r\na particular State to impose its will on other sovereign \r\nStates. In a world where the eras of imperialism and \r\ncolonialism are now behind us, we have to acknowledge \r\nthat not all nations in the General Assembly should \r\nfollow the governing model of any particular country. \r\nLarge countries should not attempt to impose their \r\nadministrative systems on small countries because \r\nthose small countries are sovereign and have legitimate \r\naspirations to upholding their own identities. Today, \r\nwhen interdependence is key, the old-style coercive \r\nmindset needs to be put to rest. Together, both large and \r\nsmall countries must respect one another and uphold \r\nthe rules of international law and the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe world is currently facing severe instability. \r\nThreats to peace are emerging in many forms, and \r\nmore intensively than anything we have witnessed in \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n46/61 18-30104\r\nthe past 25 years. We all live in a world of fragility, \r\nunpredictability and complicated changes, as \r\nchallenges come from various fronts, with an increase \r\nin the number of persistent conflicts and unprecedented \r\nhumanitarian crises.\r\nWe are deeply concerned about the tensions created \r\nin diplomatic circles by a first-world super-Power and \r\nthe conflicts that are happening in many places thanks \r\nto its interference. We are also deeply concerned \r\nabout the hasty decisions made by that super-Power to \r\nwithdraw from major international agreements. Such \r\nunilateral actions, which threaten the legitimacy of the \r\ninternational legal order, have undermined State-to-\r\nState relations and caused tension in the international \r\ncommunity. Yet what exerts the most pressure is the \r\ndirect attack on multilateralism.\r\nUndoubtedly, in our globalized world, all things \r\nare interconnected. If we begin to endorse protectionist \r\npolicies, unilateralism and trade wars, we are closing \r\nthe door on trade and investment opportunities, which, \r\nfor many decades, have brought prosperity to all our \r\ncountries, both small and large. Eventually, we will all \r\nbecome poorer, our economies will decline, financial \r\ncapital will shrink, and our ability to achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and address the \r\nchallenges caused by climate change will be seriously \r\naffected. Those factors will make poor countries suffer \r\nprolonged poverty, making us increasingly vulnerable \r\nto the dangerous ideology of terrorism and extremism \r\nand to regional conflicts.\r\nAs a small economy, Cambodia believes in the \r\nvalue of rules-based international cooperation. We have \r\nall prospered because of globalization. We are therefore \r\nconvinced that global trade should not be hindered by \r\nthe imposition of unilateral tariffs. Rather, it should \r\nbe enhanced and supported through the adherence to \r\npolicies conducive to trade and investment, as well as \r\nthrough special preferential treatment for developing \r\ncountries. Stability and diversification in the financial \r\nsector need to be further encouraged to promote \r\ninnovation and development.\r\nAll in all, we must jointly maintain and strengthen \r\nmultilateralism. In fact, peace without development \r\nis not sustainable. In that context, the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals play a pivotal role in guiding peoples \r\ntowards prosperity. Cambodia views the SDGs as an \r\nimportant opportunity for mobilizing efforts aimed at \r\nreducing poverty, as well as sustainable and inclusive \r\ndevelopment. The Royal Government of Cambodia will \r\nsoon approve the Cambodia Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, which have been fully adapted to the local level. \r\nWe will use those goals to shape our medium- and long-\r\nterm policies and plans for our country.\r\nMoreover, conflict prevention is a precondition \r\nfor long-lasting peace. United Nations peacekeeping \r\nforces play a vital leading role in such efforts. As \r\na result, Cambodia greatly welcomes the vision of \r\nSecretary-General António Guterres with respect \r\nto peacebuilding and peacekeeping, particularly his \r\nongoing attention to conflict prevention. Cambodia \r\nhas been a consistent supporter of the United Nations \r\npeace and security architectures. For instance, for the \r\npast 12 years, Cambodia has sent thousands of Blue \r\nHelmet forces to join peacekeeping missions under the \r\numbrella of the United Nations. However, peacekeeping \r\ntoday is facing unprecedented challenges, since \r\nnon-State actors are waging wars of rebellion against \r\nour peacekeeping forces. Those wars have claimed \r\nmany lives and caused much injury. We are strongly \r\nindebted to the sacrifices made by the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping heroes. Indeed, their sacrifice, including \r\nthe ultimate example — death — has only increased \r\nour commitment to further contributing to the great \r\ncause of peace.\r\nAnother severe and complicated threat to \r\nlong-lasting peace is terrorism. It has torn apart \r\ncommunities, worsened conflicts and undermined \r\nthe stability of whole regions. Currently, the battles \r\nagainst terrorism have become even more complex and \r\nsophisticated, since terrorists are turning to cyberspace \r\nto launch their malevolent operations. The cross-border \r\nnature of terrorism requires that we build multilateral \r\ncooperation with concerted coordination, including \r\ncountermeasures and preventive measures.\r\nAddressing climate change is another key element \r\nfor the success of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which requires the urgent and focused \r\nattention of the global community. The fundamentals \r\nfor action on climate change are undoubtedly contained \r\nin the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In that spirit, \r\nCambodia will provide full support to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in organizing the climate summit next year so \r\nas to foster the inspiration needed to further address \r\nclimate change.\r\nLastly, I would like to emphasize that Cambodia \r\nfully supports the global leadership of the United \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 47/61\r\nNations and commits to implementing its shared \r\nresponsibility to build a peaceful and equitable society \r\nthat enjoys sustainable and inclusive development.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Cambodia for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nSamdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Sergey Lavrov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRussian Federation.\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The statements delivered during this session’s \r\ngeneral debate confirm that international relations are \r\nnow being conducted in a complex and controversial \r\nperiod of history.\r\nToday, we are all witnessing two opposing trends \r\ncollide. On the one hand, we see the strengthening \r\nof polycentric principles of world order, the steady \r\ndevelopment of new centres of economic growth and \r\npeoples’ aspirations to preserve their sovereignty and \r\nchoose development models that are consistent with \r\ntheir national, cultural and religious identities. On the \r\nother hand, we see the desire of a number of Western \r\nStates to retain their self-proclaimed status as world \r\nleaders and slow the irreversible and objective process \r\nof establishing multipolarity. To that end, they do \r\nnot hesitate to use every possible method, including \r\npolitical blackmail, economic pressure and brute force.\r\nSuch illegal actions devalue the international \r\nlaw that underpins the post-war world order. We hear \r\nstatements trumpeted that not only call into question the \r\nlegal validity of international treaties, but also prioritize \r\nself-serving unilateral approaches over decisions made \r\nwithin the United Nations. We are seeing an assault \r\nby belligerent revisionism on the modern system of \r\ninternational law. There have been attacks on the basic \r\nprinciples of the Middle East peace process, the Joint \r\nComprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear \r\nprogramme, commitments under the framework of \r\nthe World Trade Organization, the multilateral Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change and many more.\r\nAt the same time, our Western colleagues continue \r\nto seek to replace the supremacy of law in world affairs \r\nwith some kind of so-called rules-based order. Those \r\nrules themselves are invented depending on whatever \r\nis politically expedient and are a reflection of double \r\nstandards. Baseless accusations of interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of various countries are being made \r\nalongside overt attempts to undermine and topple \r\ndemocratically elected Governments. Efforts are being \r\nmade to draw some countries into military alliances \r\nthat are designed to further specific agendas against the \r\nwill of the peoples of those countries, while other States \r\nare threatened with punishment for their free choice of \r\npartners and allies. It is telling that aggressive attacks \r\non international institutions are being accompanied by \r\nattempts to privatize their secretariat structures and \r\ngrant them the rights of intergovernmental bodies in \r\nthe hope of manipulating them later.\r\nThe shrinking space for constructive international \r\ncooperation, escalating confrontations, a growing \r\noverall lack of predictability, and a substantially higher \r\nrisk of spontaneous conflicts all affect the work of this \r\nglobal Organization. The international community \r\nhas to pay a high price for the parochial, self-serving \r\nambitions of a small group of countries. The collective \r\nmechanisms for responding to common security \r\nchallenges have stalled. Diplomacy and a culture of \r\nnegotiation and compromise are increasingly replaced \r\nby dictates and unilateral extraterritorial restrictions \r\neffected without the consent of the Security Council. \r\nSuch measures, which have already been applied to \r\ndozens of countries, are ineffective as well as illegal, \r\nas demonstrated by the more than half-century of \r\nthe United States blockade of Cuba, which has been \r\ncondemned by the entire international community.\r\nOnce again, however, the lessons are not being \r\ndrawn from history. The number of those who want \r\nto hand down verdicts without bothering with charges \r\nor trials is not getting any smaller. Today assumptions \r\nin the spirit of the notorious “highly likely” approach \r\nseem to provide sufficient grounds for some of our \r\nWestern colleagues to make accusations against anyone \r\nthey want to. We have already been through that, and \r\nwe well remember how often spurious pretexts have \r\nbeen used to justify interventions and unleash wars, as \r\nwas the case in Yugoslavia in 1999, Iraq in 2003 and \r\nLibya in 2011. The same methods are being used in \r\nSyria today. On 14 April, missile strikes were launched \r\nagainst Syria on a completely invented pretext, just \r\nhours before international inspectors were expected to \r\narrive at the site of an incident that had been staged. \r\nThis is a warning against any further provocations \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n48/61 18-30104\r\nby terrorists and their patrons involving the use of \r\nchemical weapons, which would be unacceptable.\r\nThe conflict in Syria has already lasted seven years. \r\nThe failed attempt to effect regime change, which was \r\norchestrated from outside and relied on extremists, \r\nnearly resulted in the country’s disintegration and the \r\nemergence of a terrorist caliphate in its place. Russia’s \r\nenergetic action, in response to the request of the \r\nGovernment of the Syrian Arab Republic and supported \r\nby diplomatic efforts in the context of the Astana \r\nprocess, helped prevent that devastating scenario. \r\nThe Syrian National Dialogue Congress, initiated by \r\nRussia, Iran and Turkey in Sochi in January, established \r\nthe conditions for a political settlement in line with \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2254 (2015), and the basis \r\nfor the intra-Syrian constitutional committee now \r\nbeing established in Geneva. Its agenda includes the \r\nrestoration of ruined infrastructure in order to facilitate \r\nthe return of millions of refugees to their homes. \r\nAssistance in addressing those issues in the interest of \r\nall Syrians, without double standards, must become a \r\npriority for international efforts and the activities of \r\nUnited Nations agencies.\r\nDespite the complexity of the situation in Syria, \r\nIraq, Yemen and Libya, we must not lose sight of \r\nthe long-standing Palestinian question. A just and \r\nequitable solution to that issue is crucial to improving \r\nthe situation throughout the Middle East. I want to \r\nwarn against any unilateral approaches in this area \r\nor attempts to monopolize this peace process. Today, \r\nas never before, the international community should \r\nconsolidate its efforts with the aim of restarting talks \r\non the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions \r\nand the Arab Peace Initiative. Russia will continue to \r\ndo its utmost to facilitate the process, including within \r\nthe Middle East Quartet and in cooperation with the \r\nLeague of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation. Mutually acceptable agreements must \r\nensure the peaceful and safe coexistence of the two \r\nStates of Israel and Palestine.\r\nHere at the United Nations, which was created on \r\nthe basis of lessons learned from the Second World \r\nWar, we must all think about a future in which the \r\nrepetition of past mistakes should have no place. This \r\nyear marks the eightieth anniversary of the notorious \r\nMunich agreement crowning the criminal policy of \r\nappeasement of the Third Reich, a sad example of the \r\ncatastrophic consequences that can result from national \r\negotism, disregard for international law and attempts to \r\nsolve problems at others’ expense.\r\nRegrettably, in a number of countries today not only \r\nhas the vaccine against the Nazi plague been weakened, \r\nbut a rising campaign to rewrite history and whitewash \r\nwar criminals and their associates is emerging. In \r\nour view, the campaigns being waged in a number of \r\ncountries to demolish monuments to the liberators of \r\nEurope are an outrage. We call on the Assembly to \r\nsupport the draft of this year’s versin of the annual \r\nresolution on the inadmissibility of glorification of the \r\nNazis.\r\nThe growth of radical nationalism and neo-fascism \r\nin Ukraine, where criminals who fought under Waffen-\r\nSS banners have been declared heroes, is one of the \r\nmain factors in the protracted intra-Ukrainian conflict. \r\nThe only way to settle that conflict is to ensure the \r\ncomprehensive and consistent implementation in good \r\nfaith of the Minsk package of measures, approved \r\nunanimously by the Security Council in its resolution \r\n2202 (2015). We support the activities of the Special \r\nMonitoring Mission to Ukraine of the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and are ready to \r\nprovide its monitors with United Nations protection.\r\nHowever, instead of implementing the Minsk \r\nagreements and engaging in dialogue with Donetsk and \r\nLuhansk, Kyiv continues to harbour the illusion that it \r\nmay be able to put occupying forces in Donbas with \r\nthe support of the West and is increasingly threatening \r\nto resort to military options. The sponsors of the \r\ncurrent Kyiv authorities must bring their clients to their \r\nsenses, make them lift the blockade of Donbas and end \r\ndiscrimination against ethnic minorities throughout \r\nUkraine.\r\nIn Kosovo, the international military presence \r\nauthorized by the Security Council is being transformed \r\ninto a United States military base, and Kosovo armed \r\nforces are being created. The agreements between \r\nBelgrade and Pristina brokered by the European Union \r\nare not being implemented. Russia calls on the parties \r\nto engage in dialogue in accordance with the principles \r\nof Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and will \r\nsupport a decision that would be acceptable for Serbia. \r\nIn general, we urge that the Balkans not be once again \r\ntransformed into an arena for confrontation or declared \r\nto be someone’s particular patrimony. The peoples of \r\nthe Balkans must not be forced to face a false choice, \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 49/61\r\nand we must prevent new dividing lines from emerging \r\nin the region.\r\nWe need to shape an architecture of equal and \r\nindivisible security elsewhere in the world, including \r\nthe Asia-Pacific region. We welcome the positive \r\ndevelopments on the Korean peninsula following the \r\nlogic of the Russian-Chinese road map. It is important \r\nto encourage that process, which should be based on \r\ncontinuing the rapprochement between the parties \r\nand on promoting the practical implementation of the \r\nimportant arrangements arrived at by Pyongyang and \r\nSeoul through the Security Council. We will continue \r\nto work to launch a multilateral process aimed at \r\nestablishing a robust mechanism for peace and security \r\nin North-East Asia as soon as possible.\r\nThe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is \r\namong the tasks before the international community in \r\nthe key security area of the non-proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction. Regrettably, serious obstacles to \r\nthat track continue to pile up. The unilateral withdrawal \r\nby the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan \r\nof Action, in violation of Security Council resolution \r\n2231 (2015), and despite Iran’s full compliance with \r\nits obligations, came on top of the lack of progress in \r\nthe ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty and the establishment of a zone free of weapons \r\nof mass destruction in the Middle East. We will do \r\neverything possible to preserve the deal approved by \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nWe are seeing increasingly negative trends in \r\nthe activities of the Organization for the Prohibition \r\nof Chemical Weapons (OPCW) whereby the West is \r\nattempting to transform the Technical Secretariat into \r\nan instrument for punishing undesirable Governments, \r\nwhich risks compromising the OPCW’s independent \r\nprofessional status, the universality of the Chemical \r\nWeapons Convention and the exclusive prerogatives \r\nof the Security Council. Those and other problems in \r\nthe area of non-proliferation were discussed in detail in \r\nthe Security Council on 26 September (see S/PV.8362), \r\nconvened at a very timely moment by the United States \r\npresidency.\r\nWe firmly believe that any problems or concerns \r\nthat arise in international relations should be addressed \r\nthrough a substantive dialogue. If there are any bones \r\nof contention, we should come together around the \r\nnegotiating table, engage in talks, present facts, heed \r\nthe our partners’ counterarguments and seek a balance \r\nof interests.\r\nIn the past couple of years, the debate on abuses in \r\ncyberspace has become more intense. I would like to \r\ndraw attention to the fact that it was Russia that initiated \r\ndiscussion of international information-security issues \r\nat the United Nations 20 years ago. Against the backdrop \r\nof recent developments, it is becoming ever more urgent \r\nthat under the auspices of the United Nations we should \r\ndevelop global rules for the responsible behaviour of \r\nStates in cyberspace, including the principles of the \r\nnon-use of force, non-interference in internal affairs and \r\nrespect for State sovereignty. We intend to introduce a \r\ndraft resolution to that effect in the First Committee. \r\nWe also believe that it is important to start work on a \r\nconvention on cybercrime, and we envisage holding the \r\nrelevant discussions in the Third Committee.\r\nIt is more essential than ever to seek mutually \r\nacceptable agreements and the mutual consideration \r\nof interests in the areas of global trade and economic \r\nrelations, which today are being subjected to an \r\nunprecedented degree of politicization. The values of \r\nfree trade are being held hostage to trade wars and \r\nother forms of unfair competition.\r\nRussia has consistently promoted a philosophy \r\nof shared economic development, as enshrined in \r\nthe Greater Eurasian Partnership initiative launched \r\nby President Vladimir Putin, a large-scale project \r\nopen to all Asian and European States regardless of \r\ntheir membership in other integration associations. If \r\nconsistently implemented, it could help to develop a the \r\nspace for extensive economic cooperation in Eurasia. In \r\nthe long term, it could lay the foundations for a renewed \r\ncontinental security architecture fit for the realities of \r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nRussia will continue to do its utmost to build a world \r\nbased on law, truth and justice, and we are not alone in \r\nthat aspiration. Together with us, our allies and partners \r\nin the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the \r\nEurasian Economic Community, the Commonwealth \r\nof Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation \r\nOrganization, the Brazil, Russia, India, China and \r\nSouth Africa (BRICS) group and an overwhelming \r\nmajority of other countries are advocating for the \r\ndemocratization of all aspects of international affairs \r\nand in the interests of all States, without exception. The \r\nWest should also heed that voice, which is becoming \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n50/61 18-30104\r\nmore and more evident in the activities of the Group \r\nof 20.\r\nIn today’s turbulent circumstances, the growing \r\nrelevance of the United Nations — the only existing \r\nforum for overcoming differences and coordinating \r\nthe activities of the international community — is an \r\nobjective reality. Cooperation, with a view to arriving \r\nat broadly acceptable solutions, was a priority built into \r\nthe foundations of the United Nations from the very \r\nstart. Today we must not fail to live up to the high goals \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nits dedication by the drafters to future generations.\r\nWe should recall the art of negotiation in order to \r\nbe worthy of their legacy. Many of today’s problems \r\ncan be solved only on a basis of equality and mutual \r\nrespect. Dictates and coercion, hallmarks of the era of \r\ncolonialism, should once and for all be filed away in \r\nthe archives or, better yet, consigned to the dustbin of \r\nhistory.\r\nSome great statesmen of the past have bequeathed \r\nto us many words of wisdom that have come to be \r\naphorisms. Let me quote just one, from President Harry \r\nTruman: “The responsibility of the great States is to \r\nserve and not to dominate the world”.\r\nI hope that a culture of mutually respectful dialogue \r\nwill finally prevail. Russia will do everything it can to \r\nachieve that.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Heiko Maas, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Federal Republic of Germany.\r\nMr. Maas (Germany) (spoke in German; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): A veteran \r\nof United Nations diplomacy recently told me that \r\nevery session of the General Assembly has its own \r\ncrisis to discuss, its own major topic. So what is the \r\nbig issue in 2018? Syria? North Korea? The Middle \r\nEast? Or the dramatic global refugee situation, from the \r\nMediterranean to Venezuela?\r\nIf we take a step back, those disparate conflicts \r\nreveal a bigger picture and a distinct pattern. It becomes \r\nclear that we are indeed facing a crisis — a crisis \r\nof multilateralism. And that crisis makes conflicts \r\naround the world appear insoluble. When I say that \r\nthey “appear” insoluble, that reflects the faith that we \r\nGermans have in multilateralism. Germany’s post-war \r\nsuccess story is also multilateralism’s success story.\r\nEurope, which was scarred by war and destruction, \r\nwas able to integrate in freedom, security and \r\nprosperity thanks to our neighbours’ courage in \r\nseeking reconciliation. The United States also played \r\na crucial role in Europe’s reconstruction. The fact that \r\nEurope was then able to become the closest partner of \r\nthe United Nations is a triumph of multilateralism. We \r\nbelieve in the United Nations because international \r\ncooperation changed our own fate for the better.\r\nEurope has proved to the world that multilateralism \r\nand sovereignty are not mutually exclusive. On the \r\ncontrary, in a world faced with immense global \r\nproblems, we can safeguard sovereignty only by \r\nworking together.\r\nThree words, “we the peoples”, express both \r\nour goal and how we will achieve it. That is why the \r\nfounders of the United Nations chose those as the \r\nopening words of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThey wanted to spell out that we need to work together \r\nto find solutions. They wanted to leave no doubt as to \r\nwhom the United Nations and we as representatives of \r\nStates serve — the people.\r\nThe Charter’s promises are addressed to the people, \r\nwho are assured that their freedom and dignity will be \r\ndefended at the United Nations in New York. But does \r\na boy in Idlib, who lives in constant fear of the next air \r\nstrike, feel that? How does a girl in Africa feel when \r\nher life expectancy at birth is 30 years lower than it \r\nwould be if she were born in Germany? If we do not act \r\non their behalf, “we the peoples” will be nothing more \r\nthan hollow words for them. Kofi Annan once said, \r\n“We don’t need any more promises. We need to start \r\nkeeping the promises we already made.” (SG/SM/9095)\r\nWhen Germany joins the Security Council as \r\na non-permanent member in a few weeks’ time, that \r\nwill be what motivates us. I thank the members of the \r\nAssembly for the immense trust they have shown in us \r\nthrough their votes. That trust is an incentive for us to \r\nplay our part in tackling the world’s crises, and to do \r\nso with courage and hope, but without overestimating \r\nourselves. We want to work with all Member States as \r\na reliable partner putting dialogue and cooperation at \r\nthe heart of its action. In our view, “we the peoples” \r\nrefers in particular to those who find it hard to be heard \r\nat the United Nations. That means we will always seek \r\ndialogue with civil society, in the Security Council and \r\nbeyond.\r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 51/61\r\nNevertheless, “we the peoples” also means that the \r\nSecurity Council itself must become more representative \r\nand inclusive. The world’s population has more than \r\ntripled since 1945, while the number of States Members \r\nof the United Nations has almost quadrupled. Yet the \r\nSecurity Council has hardly changed at all. That is why \r\nwe should stop beating around the bush and finally \r\nstart real negotiations on Security Council reform, as \r\nthe vast majority of Member States have wanted for a \r\nlong time.\r\nThe crisis of multilateralism is most painfully \r\nevident in Syria. The civil war has long since turned into \r\na widespread regional conflict, with further potential \r\nfor escalation in an already ravaged part of the world. \r\nThat sort of war cannot be resolved by military means, \r\nbecause the players in the region are too deeply involved \r\nand the individual stakes are too high. However, with \r\nunited diplomatic efforts, we have managed to prevent \r\nescalation in Idlib, which is a glimmer of hope. The \r\nagreement between Turkey and Russia must now be \r\npermanently implemented. But ultimately, and at long \r\nlast, we need a political process.\r\nTo that end, talks must be held under the auspices \r\nof the United Nations. In resolution 2254 (2015), the \r\nSecurity Council itself showed the way. We must finally \r\ntake the path to free and fair elections. At that point, \r\nwe will also be willing to shoulder responsibility for \r\nreconstruction. However, there is one line that we will \r\nnot cross: we will not become accomplices to a regime \r\nthat has forfeited its political legitimacy. Instead, we \r\nare doing our utmost to alleviate people’s suffering.\r\nIt is shameful that financial support is running \r\nout once again. As the second-largest humanitarian \r\ndonor, Germany is willing to provide the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with \r\na further €116 million — that is, half of the amount \r\ncurrently needed — to help Syrian refugees in Jordan \r\nand Lebanon. But others also need to step up. After all, \r\nthe Charter talks about “we the peoples”.\r\nDisruptive foreign-policy approaches have now \r\nalso reached the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Many \r\npeople are keen to make us believe that the notion of a \r\nnegotiated two-State solution is obsolete. They want us \r\nto think that it is now merely a term used in diplomacy \r\nand can no longer be achieved. But whatever way \r\nthey twist it, there will be lasting peace only if people \r\ncan determine the course of their own lives, living in \r\nsecurity and dignity on both sides of the 1967 lines. \r\nFor that very reason, it remains important to work for a \r\nnegotiated two-State solution, 25 years after Oslo.\r\nThe conflict in Ukraine will also continue to \r\ncompel our attention. Along with France, Russia and \r\nUkraine, we are working hard to implement the Minsk \r\nagreements. The focus is on the measures agreed to a \r\nlong time ago with a view to stabilizing the ceasefire. \r\nAll efforts, including our discussions on a possible \r\nUnited Nations mission in eastern Ukraine, are aimed \r\nat achieving that end.\r\nLet us not forget that acute crisis management \r\nis at best a step towards peace. Lasting peace can be \r\nachieved only if we put a stop to the arms race. That is \r\nnot some sort of nostalgic rhetoric from the days of the \r\nCold War, whose balance of terror seems utterly benign \r\ncompared to the scenario of a multipolar arms race with \r\nfar more unpredictable players.\r\nIn the case of North Korea, the Security Council’s \r\nunited stance and sanctions helped to pave the way \r\nback to dialogue. That was important. However, North \r\nKorea must follow up its words with deeds, and that \r\nmust lead to complete, verifiable and irreversible \r\ndenuclearization. Germany is prepared to contribute \r\nits know-how, including the expertise we gained during \r\nthe difficult negotiations with Iran.\r\nThe nuclear agreement with Iran may not be perfect. \r\nBut so far, it has prevented Iran from obtaining nuclear \r\nweapons and averted an escalation that was highly \r\nlikely three years ago. That is not insignificant. We \r\nEuropeans, together, therefore stand by the agreement. \r\nWe are working on keeping economic exchange with \r\nIran possible, and we call on Iran to continue to fully \r\nlive up to its commitments. The fact that we stand by \r\nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action does not mean \r\nthat we are turning a blind eye to Iran’s destructive role \r\nin the region or to its ballistic-missile programme. That \r\nsaid, if there were no agreement, that would not make \r\nthe search for solutions in Yemen, Syria or elsewhere \r\nany easier. On the contrary, disarmament, arms control \r\nand non-proliferation must generally become more of a \r\nfocus of the work of the United Nations once again. We \r\nshare the view of Secretary-General Guterres on this \r\nmatter.\r\nOur shared rules must keep pace with technological \r\ndevelopments. Otherwise, what currently sounds like \r\nscience fiction may very soon become deadly reality, \r\nas exemplified by autonomous weapons systems, or \r\nkiller robots that kill without any human control. I call \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n52/61 18-30104\r\non Members to support, both here in New York and in \r\nGeneva, our initiative to ban fully autonomous weapons \r\nbefore it is too late.\r\nIt is not only in that domain that prevention is \r\nthe right answer. The United Nations of the twenty-\r\nfirst century must tackle the root causes of conflict, \r\nincluding climate change. Action based solely on \r\nnationalism, with each country seeking to put itself \r\nfirst, reaches its limits in that respect, not least because \r\nour climate knows no borders. The alarm bells have \r\nrarely sounded as loudly as they did in the summer of \r\n2018 in almost all parts of the world.\r\nGermany and the European Union stand by the \r\nParis Agreement. Moreover, we want to ensure that \r\nthe Security Council makes the devastating effects that \r\nclimate change can have on the security and stability \r\nof entire countries and regions an even greater priority.\r\nWe also need a quantum leap when it comes to \r\npost-conflict peacebuilding. That is why Germany will \r\ncontribute at least €25 million to the Peacebuilding \r\nFund this year. Over the past three years, Germany has \r\ntripled its contributions to efforts aimed at promoting \r\nstabilization and preventing crises around the world. \r\nFor example, in Iraq, where Islamic State terrorists \r\nhave mostly been militarily defeated, instead of leaving \r\nthe Iraqi authorities to fend for themselves, we are \r\ntraining security forces to support administrative \r\nstructures and providing civil support for efforts to \r\npromote stabilization, reconciliation and inclusive \r\nreconstruction.\r\nOnly when military measures are embedded in a \r\nclear political strategy can peacekeepers truly bring \r\npeace. That is also the objective of the peacekeeping \r\nreform efforts of Secretary-General Guterres. It would \r\nbe a mistake to limit our discussion to bartering over \r\ndecimal points in scales for assessed contributions. \r\nOf course efficiency is important, including for us in \r\nEurope, who are the largest contributors of funding. \r\nHowever, discussing potential cost savings alone \r\ndoes not do justice to the benefits that peacekeeping \r\nmissions bring, for example, in countries such as Mali \r\nor Lebanon, which have held peaceful elections and \r\nenjoyed relative stability, thanks in part to the Blue \r\nHelmets and the political efforts of the United Nations.\r\nWe Germans will continue to contribute, not only \r\nmilitarily and financially but also, always, politically, \r\nthrough diplomatic efforts and by investing in stability \r\nand reconstruction. After all, the success of United \r\nNations missions hinges on the political backing of \r\nMember States. That is particularly true for Libya right \r\nnow. To tackle the Herculean task of making progress \r\non functioning State structures, the United Nations \r\nneeds our political support.\r\nPeace is more than guns falling silent. Only just \r\nsocieties, societies where men and women enjoy equal \r\nrights and where women participate in all societal \r\ndecision-making, will remain peaceful in the long \r\nterm. It is not only a matter of fairness and respect; it is \r\nsimply a question of humanity and reason. Kofi Annan \r\nput it this way in his report entitled “In larger freedom: \r\ntowards development, security and human rights for \r\nall”:\r\n“we will not enjoy development without security, \r\nwe will not enjoy security without development, \r\nand we will not enjoy either without respect for \r\nhuman rights” (A/59/2005, para. 17).\r\nSeventy years after the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, that instrument’s \r\nproclamation of dignity and personal freedom remains \r\nmerely a distant promise for many. In the Security \r\nCouncil, the Human Rights Council and the General \r\nAssembly, we will demand accountability when human \r\nrights are trampled on, be it through human trafficking \r\nin Africa or attacks on the Rohingya in Myanmar. \r\nNowhere will impunity stand. Even in war, there are \r\nlimits.\r\nWe must hold to account those who wilfully attack \r\nhumanitarian aid workers, hospitals and schools. \r\nAnyone who violates the most basic rules of human \r\ncivilization must be punished. That also applies to \r\nthose who use chemical weapons in breach of a taboo \r\nthat was respected for decades. That is why it is so \r\nimportant that the Organization for the Prohibition of \r\nChemical Weapons has been mandated to seek and \r\nidentify those responsible. The perpetrators must be \r\nfully aware that there can be no impunity for crimes \r\nagainst humanity — never, and not anywhere. In that \r\nregard, the International Criminal Court remains \r\nindispensable because it sends a clear message to the \r\nvictims and the perpetrators of the most serious crimes \r\nthat justice will prevail.\r\nEarlier, I spoke about how we Germans in particular \r\nhave faith when it comes to multilateralism. That faith is \r\nalso based on the fact that the United Nations, time and \r\nagain and despite all disagreements, delivers proof of \r\nwhat we can achieve by working together. I am thinking \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 53/61\r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which \r\nremains our guiding set of principles for making this a \r\nbetter world for all people. I am also thinking about the \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the negotiations on the global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration. The \r\nfact that more than 190 Member States — countries of \r\norigin, transit and destination — reached agreement \r\non such complex and controversial issues is a victory \r\nfor multilateralism. That success is an achievement of \r\nnations that are truly united.\r\nThe United Nations is built on our courage to reach \r\ncompromises. The Organization grows with our desire \r\nto shape things. It thrives on our common pledge to \r\nact together first. Common ground is created when we \r\nput people at the heart of what we do. The desire for \r\npeace and security, and the dream of a prosperous and \r\ndignified life, are things that all people can relate to, \r\nwhether they live in Baghdad, Berlin or Bamako. The \r\nUnited Nations belongs to the people. It is to them — the \r\npeoples of “We the peoples” — that we owe allegiance.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Khemais Jhinaoui, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of Tunisia.\r\nMr. Jhinaoui (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, it gives me pleasure to congratulate Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés and her friendly country, \r\nEcuador, on her election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at the current session. I wish her success in \r\nthat noble task. I also want to express my appreciation to \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák and his friendly country, Slovakia, \r\nfor his successful leadership of the previous session.\r\nI would be remiss not to express my appreciation \r\nfor the efforts of Secretary-General António Guterres \r\nto promote the role of the Organization in achieving \r\nsecurity, peace and development throughout the world, \r\nand our appreciation and support for the reforms and \r\ninitiatives that he has undertaken since assuming office.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our \r\nsincere condolences to the family of the late Kofi Annan, \r\nformer Secretary-General of the United Nations, and to \r\nthe African continent, recalling his invaluable work in \r\nthe service of international peace and security while \r\nsupporting human rights and contributing effectively to \r\nthe Organization’s development and reform.\r\nThe theme of this session — “Making the United \r\nNations relevant to all people: global leadership and \r\nshared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies” — reflects our shared aspirations \r\nfor a global organization capable of effectively \r\naddressing current challenges. It also underscores our \r\njoint desire to enhance the Organization’s role in the \r\nservice of peace and security, while building more \r\nequitable and effective international relations and \r\nstrengthening sustainable development efforts.\r\nWe believe that tackling those challenges is a matter \r\nof joint responsibility, calling for intense and concerted \r\nefforts to eradicate hotbeds of tension, armed conflicts \r\nand disputes, as well as the unprecedented human \r\nsuffering they inflict. Those hotbeds also exacerbate \r\nthe phenomenon of terrorism and violent extremism, as \r\nwell as all forms of organized crime, in addition to a \r\ndecline in growth rates and increases in poverty and \r\nmarginalization, together with economic recession in \r\nmany parts of the world.\r\nIn that regard, Tunisia reaffirms the responsibility \r\nof the international community, as represented in \r\nour Organization, to pursue the political settlement \r\nof ongoing disputes, resolve conflicts by peaceful \r\nmeans, achieve security and stability and promote \r\nhuman rights for the sake of safe and sustainable \r\nsocieties. While we are pleased with the results of \r\nthe negotiations on the major reforms initiated by \r\nthe Secretary-General, particularly in reviewing the \r\ninternational system pertaining to security and peace \r\nand promoting development on a regular basis, we \r\nhope that those reforms will be supported by effective \r\ncontributions from all States Members of the United \r\nNations in accordance with a comprehensive vision \r\nthat entrenches the principles of partnership and \r\nequality in international relations, as well as equitable \r\nrepresentation on the Security Council, while enabling \r\nthe General Assembly to take on its full responsibilities \r\nin accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nTrue to the firm principles of our foreign policy, Tunisia \r\nwill spare no effort in working to effectively contribute \r\nto the efforts to realize those noble objectives.\r\nTunisia continues to steadfastly enhance \r\ndemocratic governance and a State based on law and \r\ninstitutions through a consensual and participatory \r\napproach across the political spectrum and every \r\nsector of Tunisian society. Over the past year, we \r\nhave taken further steps to strengthen constitutional \r\ninstitutions and fight corruption while enhancing good \r\ngovernance. We held democratic municipal elections in \r\nMay to operationalize the very important constitutional \r\nprinciple of participatory democracy and decentralized \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n54/61 18-30104\r\nlocal governance. Through that principle, we hope to \r\npromote local development programmes and reduce \r\ndisparities between entities.\r\nLike the presidential and legislative elections held \r\nin 2014, those municipal elections resulted in a high \r\nlevel of representation of young people and women, \r\nreflecting an awareness in Tunisian society of the \r\nimportance of including women and young people in \r\ndecision-making at the local and national levels.\r\nBased on our belief in human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms as two of the pillars of democracy, and in \r\naccordance with our international commitments and \r\nthe provisions of the 2014 Constitution, President \r\nBéji Caïd Essebsi of Tunisia has launched a reform \r\ninitiative to enhance equality and the status of women, \r\nwith a dedicated committee established to that end. \r\nThat initiative is currently subject to a comprehensive \r\ndialogue engaging participants from across Tunisian \r\nsociety. As such, it is a natural extension of Tunisia’s \r\npioneering experiment in reforms aimed at establishing \r\na progressive society that respects individual rights and \r\ncollective freedoms, empowers women and achieves \r\nfull equality between men and women.\r\nWe are aware that enhancing and sustaining the \r\nemerging sustainable democratic experience in Tunisia \r\nare contingent on achieving economic recovery, \r\naddressing our current difficulties and strengthening \r\nsocial harmony. Those are priority objectives for our \r\nGovernment, in line with our 2016-2020 national \r\ndevelopment plan and in the context of implementing \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nTunisia remains committed to pursuing major \r\nreform to improve growth rates and other human \r\ndevelopment indicators, in particular by creating work \r\nopportunities for young people and promoting internal \r\nand external investment. Despite major security and \r\ndevelopment challenges, including the destabilization \r\nof the regional and international situations and its \r\ndirect effect on Tunisia’s security, growth and economic \r\ninterests, we recently recorded positive and encouraging \r\nresults — rising growth, falling unemployment and \r\ntrade deficits, and recovery in the tourism sector, with \r\nan increase in investment indicators. We believe that \r\nthose positive indicators enhance Tunisia’s status as an \r\nattractive environment for regional and international \r\ninvestment.\r\nTunisia depends not only on its own national \r\ncapabilities but also on strong relations of cooperation \r\nand partnership with regional and international \r\npartners. We would like to affirm our appreciation for \r\nthe support that the Tunisian experiment has received \r\nfrom our long-standing friends and partners the world \r\nover and to stress our interest in further expanding such \r\ncooperative partnerships to serve our shared interests \r\nand strengthen security and stability nationally and \r\ninternationally.\r\nTerrorism represents one of the most prominent \r\nchallenges to our countries, with no exceptions. It is \r\nalso one of the gravest challenges to international peace \r\nand security. Terrorist organizations seek to destabilize \r\ncountries, spread chaos and obstruct development. To \r\nconfront that threat, we underscore the central role \r\nplayed by the United Nations in supporting Member \r\nStates in eliminating terrorism and violent extremism. \r\nIn that regard, we consider the establishment of the \r\nOffice of Counter-Terrorism an important step for better \r\ncoordinating and enhancing multilateral cooperation in \r\nthat area.\r\nWhile national, regional and international \r\nefforts to combat terrorist activities are important, \r\nwe believe it is an equally important priority to \r\ntackle extremist ideologies and protect our societies, \r\nparticularly young people, against secrecy and extreme \r\nviolence. We also stress the importance of supporting \r\ninternational cooperation mechanisms for the exchange \r\nof information, expertise and judicial assistance and \r\nproviding support to countries at the forefront of \r\ncombating that scourge.\r\nTunisia has made significant progress in \r\nimplementing its comprehensive national strategy \r\nto combat terrorism and violent extremism, which \r\nhas helped us to realize security gains in terms of \r\ntackling that dangerous scourge, thwarting terrorist \r\nplots, bringing terrorists to justice and safeguarding \r\ndemocracy while respecting the rule of law\r\nIn recent years, the world has witnessed an \r\nunprecedented upsurge in f lows of refugees and \r\nmigrants resulting from protracted crises, worsening \r\narmed conflicts and related human suffering, \r\ndisrupted security, hampered development and a lack \r\nof the conditions necessary for a decent life. Despite \r\nits increase in recent years, migration remains one \r\nof the principal manifestations  of interaction and \r\ncommunication among human societies. Throughout \r\nhistory, it has contributed to rapprochement among \r\ncultures and civilizations. We believe that tackling \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 55/61\r\nmigration and refugee f lows requires a comprehensive \r\nand integrated approach that takes into account the root \r\ncauses of the two issues and prioritizes the importance \r\nof providing a dignified life for refugees and migrants, \r\nrespecting their rights and human dignity and \r\nprotecting them from criminal networks and all forms \r\nof exploitation.\r\nWe must mobilize international efforts to address \r\nthe underlying causes of migration, including the \r\ninadequate sustainable development in many countries \r\nof origin. There is also a need to address exacerbated \r\nconflicts and wars, as well as the international \r\ncommunity’s failure to bridge the gap between \r\ndeveloping and developed countries.\r\nTunisia hopes that the two United Nations global \r\ncompacts on migration and refugees will pave the way \r\nto the international consensus needed on this issue. We \r\nunderscore the importance of promoting cooperation \r\namong all components of the international community \r\nin order to settle disputes and support the development \r\nefforts of Member States, as well as of promoting \r\navenues for organized migration. While we understand \r\nthe apprehension of some States, we emphasize the need \r\nto put a stop to hostile activities and practices against \r\nmigrants and refugees and all forms of extremism, \r\nincluding in political discourse and media campaigns, \r\nwhen addressing the issue.\r\nContinued conflicts and regional and international \r\ncrises unquestionably result in increased tension \r\nand a lack of stability and security. In that respect, \r\nachieving the desired just, comprehensive solution to \r\nthe Palestinian question is an urgent priority. It would \r\nenable us to restore peace and stability to the Middle \r\nEast region, thereby allowing our brother Palestinian \r\npeople to recover their legitimate rights and establish \r\nan independent State of Palestine on their territory, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy, the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative and a two-State solution.\r\nTunisia calls on the international community to \r\nshoulder its responsibility to provide the necessary \r\nprotection for the Palestinian people and preserve \r\nthe legal and historical status of the city of Al-Quds \r\nAl-Sharif, as well as all other occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories. Tunisia has spared no effort within its own \r\nabilities to provide support to the Palestinian people \r\nand implores the international community to redouble \r\nits efforts in order to put an end to  Palestinians’ \r\nhumanitarian suffering. That includes supporting the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East so that it can continue to \r\nprovide assistance to Palestinian refugees.\r\nTunisia is deeply concerned about the developments \r\nin Libya and the serious deterioration of the security \r\nsituation in its capital, Tripoli. Tunisia renews its \r\ncommitment to undertaking efforts — at the initiative \r\nof President Essebsi, and in full cooperation with our \r\nbrother countries of Egypt and Algeria — to assist \r\nour Libyan brothers in overcoming their differences. \r\nPrecedence should be given to Libya’s interests so that \r\nthe desired political settlement can be achieved through \r\ndialogue and reconciliation on the basis of the Libyan \r\nPolitical Agreement, facilitated by the United Nations.\r\nIn that regard, Tunisia underscores its support for \r\nthe United Nations Action Plan for Libya and calls for \r\nuniting all efforts to address the Libyan crisis, without \r\ninterfering in Libyan internal affairs and avoiding \r\nmilitary options, in order to achieve peace and security, \r\nlessen the suffering of the Libyan people and accelerate \r\nthe implementation of the Action Plan.\r\nWe also call for regional and international efforts \r\nto be redoubled in order to arrive at a comprehensive \r\npolitical solution to the crisis in Syria as soon as \r\npossible, in a way that preserves the unity and territorial \r\nintegrity of that brotherly country and puts an end to \r\nthe suffering of the Syrian people while achieving their \r\naspirations for security, stability and democracy.\r\nWe also hope that the international community will \r\nbe able to help the parties in Yemen begin a dialogue \r\nin order to arrive at a political solution that supports \r\nlegitimacy while preserving the unity of that brotherly \r\ncountry, as well as its territorial integrity. We hope that \r\nsuch a solution will end the suffering of the Yemeni \r\npeople and guarantee the safety, security and stability \r\nof the Arab Gulf region.\r\nGiven our joint responsibility to ensure a universal \r\nsystem for the promotion of human rights for all, \r\nincluding the right to security and life, we call for \r\naccelerating the efforts to address the issue of Rohingya \r\nMuslims while ensuring the safe and voluntary return \r\nof refugees and working to tackle the underlying causes \r\nof the crisis.\r\nConsidering the importance with which we view \r\nbeing part of the African continent, which represents our \r\nstrategic depth, Tunisia supports joint African efforts. \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n56/61 18-30104\r\nWe are committed to the African Union’s Agenda 2063 \r\ndevelopment plan and are ready to actively engage in \r\nadvancing the continent’s prospects. We would also \r\nlike to appeal to the international community to assist \r\nin promoting peace and security on the continent so \r\nthat the peoples of Africa can achieve their aspirations \r\nfor sustainable development and economic integration.\r\nIn that context, Tunisia greatly appreciates \r\nthe agreement between the leaders of Ethiopia and \r\nEritrea to end the long-standing dispute between the \r\ntwo countries. It has given new impetus to bilateral \r\ncooperation in the interests of the two neighbouring \r\npeoples on a path to achieving security, stability and \r\ndevelopment. Tunisia also hopes that that historic \r\nreconciliation between the two countries can be a first \r\nstep towards ending all differences in the Horn of \r\nAfrica region and setting an example to be followed in \r\nterms of eliminating tensions and settling disputes on \r\nthe entire African continent.\r\nWith regard to the situation in the Korean \r\npeninsula, we are pleased with the results of the recent \r\nsummits between the President of South Korea and the \r\nleader of North Korea, as well as the summit between \r\nthe President of the United States and the leader of \r\nNorth Korea. We note the historic transformation of \r\nthe Korean peninsula and the commitment of the two \r\nKoreas to cooperating in the future. We hope that \r\nthe international community will make every effort \r\nto assist both countries in ending tensions on the \r\nKorean peninsula and restoring trust between them by \r\ndenuclearizing the peninsula and ridding it of weapons \r\nof mass destruction in order to achieve peace.\r\nWith Arab and African support, Tunisia is ready to \r\njoin the Security Council once again as a non-permanent \r\nmember for the period from 2020 to 2021. It is a goal \r\nthat we hope to achieve with the support of all our \r\nfriends and partners in the international community. If \r\nelected, Tunisia will work throughout its membership of \r\nthe Council to ensure its commitment to the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, as well as its readiness to promote \r\nconsultations. We would emphasize the importance of \r\narriving at acceptable solutions to all the items on our \r\nagenda in the service of world peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate Tunisia’s commitment to \r\ncontinue to make every possible effort to cooperate \r\nwith all sisterly and friendly countries in order to \r\nachieve the noble objectives of the United Nations in \r\nthe service of humankind in order to uphold those lofty \r\nuniversal values.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Ibrahim Abdulkarim Al-Jafari, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Iraq.\r\nMr. Al-Jafari (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, it is my pleasure to congratulate Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I \r\nwish her every success in discharging her duties in that \r\nrole. I would also like to express my appreciation to her \r\npredecessor, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, who steered the work \r\nof the previous session with wisdom and efficiency.\r\nLast year, from this rostrum, I addressed the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the situation in my country, Iraq \r\n(see A/72/PV.20). In the years prior to that, Da’esh had \r\noccupied a third of Iraq’s territory, burned everything \r\nin sight, destroyed monuments in Nineveh — dating \r\nback to the time when my country was the cradle of \r\ncivilization — as well as the Mosque of the Prophet \r\nYunus, expelled 6 million Iraqis from the provinces \r\nit occupied, preyed on the Yazidi religious minority \r\nby kidnapping its women, drove out ethnic Turkmen \r\nfrom Tal Afar and killed Shia men and women there by \r\nburning them alive.\r\nAll of that could have been a catastrophe of historic \r\nproportions from which we could never recover. \r\nHowever, although despair had seized the hearts and \r\nminds of many, there were still many of us whose full \r\nfaith in God never wavered. Many of us were confident \r\nthat the determination of Iraqi men and women of all ages \r\nand the intelligence of our leaders could turn the tide. \r\nThe people of Iraq, of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds, \r\ncame together to defend their country. They shed their \r\nblood on the battlefield and made immense sacrifices \r\nto liberate the lands occupied by Da’esh. Thousands in \r\nthe ranks of the heroic Iraqi armed forces, police and \r\npopular militias were martyred or injured, as were \r\nmembers of the Peshmerga, counter-terrorism forces \r\nand other groups. We led that fight with honour on behalf \r\nof the entire world, with the support of the international \r\ncoalition against Da’esh and of our friends, brothers \r\nand neighbours. Every one of them deserves our full \r\nrecognition, and Iraq will never forget those who stood \r\nby it.\r\nThat crucial historic battle took place at a time \r\nwhen the safety of the whole world was under attack. \r\nTerrorists’ attempts to extend their reach to ever more \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 57/61\r\nparts of the planet attracted adherents representing \r\nmore than 120 different nationalities. We thank God \r\nfor the support of the international community, whose \r\nassistance made it possible for us to vanquish that \r\nferocious enemy and put an end to the Da’esh presence \r\nin Iraq. It is now on its last legs in its final stronghold, \r\nin Syria.\r\nI am addressing the General Assembly today as \r\nmy country is leavings behind that period of war and \r\nentering a new one characterized by reconstruction \r\nand the return of the displaced persons who were \r\ndriven from their homes and f led to various corners of \r\nthe globe. In this new chapter in the history of Iraq, \r\nwe are working hard to strengthen State institutions, \r\nenhance participation in governance and build \r\npolitical and constitutional consensus in our national \r\naffairs, with a view to joining the club of democratic \r\nnations. We are abandoning sectarianism of every \r\nkind and uniting people around respect for law and the \r\nConstitution. Most recently, as part of the democratic \r\nelectoral cycle that has been in place since 2004, we \r\nheld parliamentary elections. We will soon elect a new \r\nPresident of the Republic, who will in turn appoint a \r\nnew Prime Minister whose principal task will be to \r\nform a Government responsible for fighting corruption \r\nand putting the country on a path to development and \r\nprosperity.\r\nAs I address the Assembly today, Iraqis in the \r\nKurdistan region of Iraq are preparing for regional \r\nparliamentary elections, in accordance with our \r\nfederal multiparty system. In the light of that, I call on \r\nthe international community to honour the financial \r\npledges made at the Kuwait International Conference \r\nfor the Reconstruction of Iraq earlier this year, on the \r\nbasis of our being a promising country and a cradle of \r\ncivilization. Indeed, since Iraq sits at the crossroads of \r\ndifferent civilizations, religions and nationalities, we \r\nare endowed with a wealth of traditions.\r\nThe military victory over terrorism did not \r\nnecessarily spell the end of terrorism. Rather, we \r\nhave simply entered a new phase in our efforts to \r\ntotally eradicate its causes. We should strive to create \r\na strategic plan with economic, cultural and political \r\ndimensions so as to immunize communities against \r\nthe dangers of the return of terrorism. We should \r\nalso address the issues that relate to young people, \r\nwomen and children, putting in place programmes to \r\nimprove their standard of living, build capacity within \r\nthe framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and especially to tackle unemployment. \r\nWe must also protect diversity, support minorities, \r\nmaintain peace and security in liberated areas and move \r\nfrom national reconciliation to the strengthening of the \r\nnational institutions in which all Iraqis have a stake.\r\nToday Iraqis are making every effort to move \r\nforward as a single, united geographical entity, rejecting \r\nall forms of division, foreign interference and partition. \r\nMost recently, we have made important advances \r\nin fighting terrorism, strengthening democracy and \r\nkeeping to the schedule set for parliamentary elections. \r\nWe continue to fight to protect human rights, political \r\nplurality and the freedom of expression, having enacted \r\ndetailed legislation in those areas.\r\nIn standing by Iraq through the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), the United \r\nNations has made significant sacrifices. As UNAMI \r\ncontinues to work to fulfil its mandate, I want to \r\nacknowledge the key role played by Mr. Ján Kubiš, \r\nSpecial Representative and Head of the Mission, whose \r\nachievements in our country have been considerable. \r\nWe also welcome the appointment of his successor, \r\nMs. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, who is the first woman \r\nto be appointed Head of the Mission.\r\nWe continue to strive to end the effects of the war \r\nagainst terrorism on displaced persons by providing \r\nthem with reparations, ensuring their return and \r\ncollecting evidence for the crimes committed against \r\nthem by the Da’esh terrorist organization in Iraq. That \r\nwork is being done through the commission that was set \r\nup pursuant to Security Council resolution 2379 (2017) \r\nto document the crimes committed by Da’esh.\r\nThe Government of Iraq believes that the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security is the \r\nresponsibility of all of us. We stress the importance \r\nof ensuring that the international community \r\ncontinues to act to completely eliminate nuclear \r\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction, with a \r\nview to guaranteeing the safety and security of future \r\ngenerations. We support the universalization of all \r\ntreaties and conventions on disarmament, as they are \r\nthe only concrete guarantee that there will be no use or \r\nthreat of use of such weapons. Iraqis paid a heavy price \r\nwhen weapons of this kind were used against them \r\nduring their time under dictatorship. The Assembly \r\nwill recall that the inhabitants of the city of Halabja \r\nwere victims of chemical weapons in one of the most \r\negregious criminal acts in history, and that the Shia in \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n58/61 18-30104\r\ncentral and southern Iraq were subjected to similarly \r\negregious mass killings, as were members of other \r\nsects.\r\nMy Government is working to overcome the \r\neconomic crisis by making the best possible use of \r\nits resources, establishing economic partnerships and \r\ncreating an environment favourable to investment \r\nin order to benefit from available opportunities and \r\nachieve sustainable economic development.\r\nIraq reaffirms its steadfast position with regard to \r\nthe Palestinian question. We emphasize that there is no \r\nchance for peace in our region until Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, fully withdraws from the Palestinian and Arab \r\noccupied territories. We call for the establishment of an \r\nindependent Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif \r\nas its capital. We condemn the settlement policy \r\npursued by the Israeli occupying authorities in violation \r\nof international law. In that regard, Iraq categorically \r\nrejects once again the step taken by the United States in \r\nrelocating its Embassy to East Jerusalem. That action \r\nwill not serve to further the cause of peace in the region \r\nand renders the situation even more complicated.\r\nIraq rejects unilateral blockades imposed outside \r\nthe context of the United Nations system, and believes \r\nthat economic sanctions are not a way to punish \r\ngoverning regimes or organizations under an acceptable \r\nor unacceptable pretext. It is the people who suffer the \r\nunjust consequences of such sanctions. The Iraqi people \r\nwere victims of sanctions that lasted for nearly 13 years, \r\nfrom 1990 to 2003. Ordinary Iraqi people — men and \r\nwoman, the elderly, the young and children — paid the \r\nheaviest price for those economic sanctions. We are \r\nnot in favour of any blockade, because it is against the \r\npeople.\r\nTurning to security, we believe that it is an \r\nindivisible whole. We cannot pursue security within \r\nour own borders while paying no heed to that of our \r\nneighbours. Security goes hand in hand with broader \r\ngeopolitical concerns. When dealing with geosecurity, \r\nit is not enough to focus on one country’s need. We must \r\nensure that the needs of our neighbours are met as well.\r\nIraq welcomes the agreement on the situation in the \r\nKorean peninsula, which is in line with the purposes \r\nof the United Nations with regard to maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWe also hope that peace and stability will be \r\nrestored in Syria, ending the spiral of violence there \r\nand preserving its territorial integrity, while supporting \r\nall political tracks that can lead to a balanced political \r\nsolution acceptable to the Syrian Government and other \r\nSyrian parties. That would help to avoid more bloodshed \r\nand the death of innocent civilians. We therefore urge \r\nthe political stakeholders to work seriously towards this \r\ntype of political solution rather than a military one.\r\nTurning to Yemen, we believe that a solution to \r\nthe crisis there can be found only through peaceful \r\ndialogue. The conflict must come to an end, the guns \r\nof war must be silenced and all external interference \r\nmust cease.\r\nAs for Bashiqa, Iraq categorically rejects the \r\npresence of Turkish forces there and the continued \r\nviolations of Iraq’s sovereignty. We aspire to excellent \r\nand good-neighbourly relations with Turkey like those \r\nwe have with other neighbouring countries. However, \r\nwe call on Turkey to take a clear position with regard to \r\nthose violations and to put an end to them.\r\nWe also call for an increase in Iraq’s legitimate \r\nwater resources. The loss of those resources has led \r\nto significantly reduced water levels in the Tigris and \r\nEuphrates rivers, resulting in adverse environmental \r\nand economic effects with serious repercussions for \r\nthe future. In the fourth millennium B.C. it was on the \r\nbanks of those two rivers that the first civilization in \r\nhuman history emerged from the southern marshes, \r\nfrom Al-Amara and Al-Nasiriyya. We therefore feel \r\nresponsible for preserving our rights and cultural \r\nheritage.\r\nIraq categorically rejects the statements by the \r\nPrime Minister of the Israeli entity claiming the \r\npresence of Iranian forces in Iraq as justification for an \r\nattack on our sovereignty. We reject any attempt to use \r\nthe rostrum of the General Assembly to undermine the \r\nsovereignty and security of States.\r\nWe have worked recently to build close relations \r\nwith all our neighbours and other friendly countries, \r\nmoving away from polarization and international \r\npartisanship. We have sought to be a diplomatic bridge \r\nby establishing excellent relations and communications \r\nwith all stakeholders in the region and worldwide so as \r\nto have a positive impact on the achievement of security \r\nin the region.\r\nIraq will remain a cradle of cultural, religious and \r\nethnic diversity. As Sargon of Akkad said, Baghdad will \r\nremain the dome of the world, and whoever reigns over \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 59/61\r\nit will control the four winds of the world. Baghdad will \r\nnever face death and destruction. It will withstand the \r\ncrisis and its brutality. Baghdad is a creator of life. Our \r\ngreat poet Mustapha Jamal Al-Din addressed Baghdad \r\nby saying that it will continue to live. Baghdad will \r\nremain resplendent as the centuries pass. It will shine \r\nunder the sun and the moon. Thanks to its resilience, it \r\nwill withstand any adversity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Ulla Tørnæs, Minister for Development \r\nCooperation of Denmark.\r\nMs. Tørnæs (Denmark): At the outset, I would like \r\nto join others in paying tribute to the memory of the late \r\nKofi Annan, a true world leader and a firm believer in \r\nthe strength of this Organization.\r\nSeventy years ago, the General Assembly adopted \r\nthe first global human rights charter, in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. It codified the most basic \r\nprinciples of human dignity, emphasizing that we are \r\nall equal. We committed to an international order in \r\nwhich rights and freedoms could be fully realized.\r\nSeventy years ago, we knew that international \r\ncooperation was the only way to protect our populations, \r\nand through this Organization, we have delivered \r\nremarkable results.\r\nStill, the foundation on which this Organization is \r\nbuilt has perhaps never been under more pressure than \r\nit is today. The very principle of multilateralism is being \r\nquestioned. Doubt is being cast on the frameworks that \r\nprotect human rights, ensure free trade and promote \r\nglobal development. Insufficient action is being taken \r\non global problems such as climate change, poverty, \r\nmigration, terrorism and violent extremism.\r\nTo Denmark, the path forward is clear. Global \r\nchallenges require global solutions. To that end, we \r\nneed a strong United Nations, with its unique legitimacy \r\nand its universal membership, a United Nations that \r\ndelivers on its full potential.\r\nDenmark remains committed to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reform agenda. This year we open the General \r\nAssembly with three agreed tracks for reform. Together \r\nwith Algeria, Denmark had the honour to facilitate the \r\nnegotiations on reform of the development system. We \r\nare proud of the result, and we will continue to play \r\na constructive role in the important implementation \r\nahead. For instance, Denmark intends to contribute \r\nmore than $10 million to support the establishment of \r\nthe new Resident Coordinator system, and we encourage \r\nothers to follow suit.\r\nMember States have clearly voiced their support. \r\nNow the reforms must be turned into reality. The world \r\nexpects a new and more streamlined United Nations \r\nto emerge. Every entity of the United Nations must \r\nembrace this opportunity to change and make real \r\nimprovements for the benefit of our peoples.\r\nAs Member States, we must also reinvest in \r\nthe United Nations and take responsibility for \r\nour multilateral cooperation and the rules-based \r\ninternational order. That is why Denmark has presented \r\nits candidature for membership of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the 2019-2021 term. If elected, we will \r\npromote the rights and equal opportunities of women, \r\ncontinue our long-standing fight against torture, \r\nwork to protect the rights of indigenous peoples and \r\nencourage freedom of religion and belief. That must be \r\ndone without discrimination on any ground, including \r\nsexual orientation and gender identity. That is the \r\nDanish DNA and the DNA of the United Nations.\r\nIn several parts of the world, gender equality is but \r\na distant hope. Women’s rights are under increasing \r\npressure. We cannot accept that; we must stand up and \r\nchallenge it. Every woman must be able to unleash \r\nher potential — without question — to the benefit of \r\nall. We must ensure that she is the one making the \r\ndecisions concerning her. Gender equality and equal \r\nopportunities are not only fundamental human rights \r\nbut preconditions for development, peace and prosperity \r\nin any country, anywhere in the world.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the Paris Agreement on Climate Change set out a \r\nstrong global vision for achieving a more sustainable \r\nplanet. Denmark is committed to that common vision. \r\nFor more than 40 consecutive years, we have proudly \r\ndelivered on the United Nations target of providing \r\n0.7 per cent of our gross national income as official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA). Sadly, we are in a group \r\nthat has far too few members. While ODA is crucial for \r\nensuring global development, we need the involvement \r\nof all actors, especially the private sector, civil society \r\nand local authorities.\r\nWe must give young people a seat at the table \r\nin order to ensure that development is pursued not \r\njust for young people but with and by them. That is \r\nwhy Denmark was the first country to announce a \r\ncontribution to the Secretary-General’s new Youth \r\nA/73/PV.12 28/09/2018\r\n60/61 18-30104\r\n2030 strategy. We congratulate the United Nations and \r\nall young people on that strategy and look forward to \r\nseeing it in action.\r\nMember States and the United Nations system have \r\nto adapt to the world around us and embrace and use \r\nnew technologies. We need the innovative ideas, the \r\nfinance and the expertise that only the private sector \r\ncan bring to the table. In short, in order to attain the \r\nSustainable Development Goals over the next 12 years, \r\nwe must rethink the way we do business here. The clock \r\nis ticking. That is one of the reasons that Denmark, \r\ntogether with its partners, launched the Partnering \r\nfor Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G) \r\ninitiative. Through the P4G network, we bring together \r\nmajor companies, cities, civil society, think tanks and \r\nGovernments to boost and create partnerships for a \r\ngreener tomorrow. In October, Denmark will host a \r\nhigh-level P4G summit in Copenhagen to forge and \r\naccelerate such partnerships.\r\nEducation provides the foundations for knowledge \r\nand for harnessing the technologies and opportunities \r\nof tomorrow. When it comes to education, we can and \r\nmust do better, much better. Globally, 130 million girls \r\ndo not go to school. In crisis situations, girls are two and \r\na half times less likely to be at school than boys. Girls \r\nare at much greater risk than boys of being victims of \r\nsexual abuse or exploitation, and much more likely to \r\nbe affected by child marriage or childbirth. Just think. \r\nIn some parts of the world, girls as young as nine years \r\nold are being forced to marry adult men. That is not \r\nacceptable. We must let girls be girls, not brides.\r\nEducation is a beacon of hope for those girls. \r\nThat is why Denmark is now the largest contributor to \r\nEducation Cannot Wait, and why we will spend almost \r\n$70 million next year on education in developing \r\ncountries, because Denmark wants to ensure that no \r\ngirl will be left behind.\r\nDisplacement and unsafe and irregular migration \r\npose a significant global challenge that requires \r\ndetermined efforts at all levels. In July, Denmark \r\nwelcomed the finalization of the negotiations on a \r\nglobal compact on migration. The compact establishes \r\na global framework for common action and a much-\r\nneeded path for managing irregular migration in a \r\nsafe and orderly manner and for curbing irregular \r\nmigration, including through the facilitation of return, \r\nwith respect for human rights and the principle of State \r\nsovereignty at its core.\r\nWe also welcome the agreement on the global \r\ncompact on refugees. Denmark is, per capita, one of \r\nthe world’s largest humanitarian donors. A key focus \r\nof ours is helping refugees and internally displaced \r\npersons in their efforts to attain a life of safety and \r\ndignity. By ensuring close coordination between our \r\nhumanitarian and development aid, Denmark helps \r\nto build the foundation for lasting solutions and safe \r\nreturn when the time is right.\r\nThe horrors in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere tell the \r\ngrim story of why humanitarian efforts are so desperately \r\nneeded. The conflict in Syria rages into its eighth \r\nyear. So many have already experienced unspeakable \r\nsuffering, evil and atrocities. Three million people have \r\nbeen on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib. \r\nThe tragedy in Syria cannot continue.\r\nEarlier this week, Member States honoured Nelson \r\nMandela. In a fitting celebration of an iconic proponent \r\nof peace, leaders from across the world underscored \r\nthe importance of our joint commitment to building a \r\npeaceful and prosperous world.\r\nAs we push for reforms and strengthen our \r\nmultilateral institutions, we must acknowledge the \r\ninterconnectedness of today’s global challenges. \r\nWe need integrated and shared approaches to \r\nstabilization, peacebuilding and conflict prevention. \r\nThat is why Denmark has been a strong supporter of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund. We are proud to step up our \r\ncommitment with a new contribution to the Fund of \r\n$15 million over the next three years.\r\nThe world is witnessing armed conflicts that could \r\nhave been prevented or stopped years ago. Too many \r\nStates are failing in their responsibility to protect their \r\nown populations against the most horrific crimes.\r\nDenmark will continue to insist on accountability \r\nfor the most appalling crimes. Such crimes must \r\nnever go unpunished, and the victims deserve justice. \r\nThis year we mark the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, a \r\nlandmark achievement aimed at ensuring accountability \r\nand justice.\r\nThe recent report of the United Nations Independent \r\nFact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (A/HRC/39/64) \r\nclearly underlines the need for accountability in \r\nrelation to the Rohingya crisis. At the same time, we \r\nmust not forget the enormous need for humanitarian \r\nassistance and development aid. I am happy to announce \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.12\r\n18-30104 61/61\r\nthat Denmark will provide another $7 million as an \r\nextraordinary humanitarian response to that crisis. \r\nThat is in addition to the $46 million we have already \r\nprovided since 2017. Denmark also provides support \r\nto the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Myanmar.\r\nThe situation on the Korean peninsula is a strong \r\nreminder of what is at stake. Denmark fully supports \r\nthe continuing efforts by South Korea and the United \r\nStates to seek a diplomatic solution with the North \r\nKorean regime. North Korea must now take concrete \r\nsteps towards complete, verifiable and irreversible \r\ndenuclearization. Until then, sanctions and international \r\npressure must remain firmly in place.\r\nThe problems facing the world are dire. We will be \r\nsuccessful only if we act together. Multilateralism and \r\ncooperation must be the foundation. The task may seem \r\nimpossible, but we have done it before. With the United \r\nNations, we have fostered an international order, a \r\nstrong set of common values, rules and goals. People \r\naround the world demand solutions. The United Nations \r\ncannot let them down. Now is the time for us to reform \r\nand rebuild this institution.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.35 p.m.\r\n"
