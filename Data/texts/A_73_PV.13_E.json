Harris, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, National Security, People \r\nEmpowerment and Constituency Empowerment \r\nof Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nSustainable Development, National Security, People \r\nEmpowerment and Constituency Empowerment of \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nMr. Timothy S. Harris, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Sustainable Development, National \r\nSecurity, People Empowerment and Constituency \r\nEmpowerment of Saint Kitts and Nevis, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Timothy S. \r\nHarris, Prime Minister and Minister for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, National Security, People Empowerment \r\nand Constituency Empowerment of Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Harris (Saint Kitts and Nevis): It is my \r\nprivilege and honour once again to address the General \r\nAssembly on behalf of the Federation of Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis. At the outset, allow me to congratulate the \r\nPresident on her election to lead this body at this most \r\nsignificant time and as the first woman to assume the \r\npost from the Group of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates. I assure her of my country’s fullest support \r\nduring her tenure.\r\nDuring the opening days of this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly we paid tribute to the late former \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, whom we remember \r\ndearly, and what he said about the United Nations, \r\nnamely, that it was critical in the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts to solve the wide range of global \r\nproblems. Multilateralism, with the United Nations \r\nsystem at its fulcrum, has long informed our global \r\nengagements. The United Nations has been, is and will \r\ncontinue to be critical to global peace, progress and \r\nprosperity. That is why there is a need to move urgently \r\nto reform the United Nations, making it more responsive \r\nto the needs and concerns of all, in particular small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS).\r\nThe United Nations has become too preoccupied \r\nwith summitry, that is, with specialized high-level \r\nmeetings and declarations, and less focused on \r\ndelivery. The lack of cooperation among Member \r\nStates stymies the forward march of humankind. \r\nA reformed United Nations must become a body of \r\ngreater action and fewer words. We need urgent action \r\non climate change, non-communicable diseases, global \r\ncooperation, peace, prosperity and the reordering of the \r\ninternational financial system. Guided by this year’s \r\ntheme, “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

More than a week ago, we celebrated 35 \r\nyears of independence. We have made significant \r\nprogress towards alleviating poverty, providing free \r\nprimary and secondary education, ensuring access to \r\naffordable health care and enhancing the standard of \r\nliving for our citizens and residents.\r\nAll those gains could be erased by the phenomenon \r\nof climate change. The damage sustained last year \r\nby the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States \r\nsubregion as a result of Hurricanes Irma and Maria \r\nwas unimaginable. The high-level pledging conference \r\nin the aftermath of those hurricanes was an attempt \r\nto chart the way forward towards creating resilience \r\nand better recovery. We ask that Member States with \r\ncommitments still outstanding fulfil them as soon \r\nas practicable. We applaud those countries that have \r\nredeemed their pledges. There is still a great deal to \r\nbe done to restore affected Member States, but that \r\nrequires strong, meaningful and enduring international \r\npartnerships.\r\nWe continue to highlight, on the one hand, our \r\ninherent vulnerabilities to natural disasters and, \r\non the other hand, an unflinching determination to \r\nmaintain a sustainable society. Our responsibility is \r\nclear. Individually and collectively, we must commit \r\nto reducing the amount of harmful materials that \r\nwe emit into the environment. It is a matter of great \r\nconcern that nations such as my own continue to pay \r\ndearly for a problem that we did not create. Our people \r\nsee the impact of climate change on their lives and \r\nlivelihoods. Climate change is largely the consequence \r\nof the actions of the more developed countries, their \r\ncarbon emissions and harmful lifestyles, yet SIDS pay \r\nan unfair price — a price so high that, for many of us, \r\nclimate change presents an existential threat.\r\nIn that connection, how will the United Nations \r\nassist our region with the growing prevalence of the \r\nsargassum seaweed that has adversely impacted the \r\nCaribbean area and is thought to be a noxious side \r\neffect of global warming? Sargassum affects our \r\nmarine environment, in particular our coastal fisheries, \r\nand has affected the revenues of the fisherfolk in the \r\nregion. Hotels, beaches and other tourism-related \r\nactivities have also been severely impacted. It is \r\nmy fervent hope that my plea today for international \r\nintervention will bring some relief to the people of our \r\nregion. We must hold countries accountable for the \r\nenvironmental degradation that they cause not only \r\nin their own jurisdictions but also in other States. The \r\nUnited Nations system presents the best vehicle to do \r\nthat.\r\nWe welcome the funding mechanisms established \r\nto assist countries, particularly highly vulnerable \r\nSIDS. However, the process must be transparent, easily \r\naccessible and, most importantly, the commitments \r\nof donor countries must bear fruit. That said, the \r\ninternational community cannot on the one hand \r\nclaim to be helping SIDS, while at the same time \r\nclassifying us as middle- and high-income countries \r\nbased on archaic financial models that ultimately deny \r\naccess to critical developmental assistance and hinder \r\ninvestment financing. We reiterate our calls for the \r\ninternational community to address with urgency the \r\nsterile measure of per capita income now employed. It is \r\nequally important to address the issues of disaster-risk \r\ninsurance and recognition of the unique vulnerabilities \r\nof small States. My country remains committed to \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and the SIDS \r\nAccelerated Modalities of Action Pathway.\r\nThe developmental efforts of small States are also \r\nbeing thwarted by an unfair financial architecture, \r\nwhich includes the threat of de-risking and the loss \r\nof correspondent banking relationships. That is \r\ncompounded by the very discriminatory and irrational \r\nblacklisting of countries that are forced to divert scarce \r\nresources to address the onerous and arbitrary demands \r\nof the European Union’s Code of Conduct Group for \r\nbusiness taxation and other entities created by large, \r\nhighly developed countries. It is completely unfair to \r\nsubject some countries to such evaluation and ever-\r\nf luctuating standards, while others are exempt.\r\nThe threats to the survival of small States are \r\nreal. I therefore call on this body to bring the plight of \r\nsmall States like Saint Kitts and Nevis to the forefront \r\nof international discourse and to bring an end to the \r\ndiscriminatory policies that I have mentioned. At great \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 3/65\r\ncost, my country and other small States seek to rise \r\nto the challenges posed by the unfair international \r\nfinancial architecture. However, the frequency and \r\narbitrariness of those unilateral demands derail \r\nessential development efforts in small States. I submit \r\nto this body that we deserve and have a right to expect \r\nfairness, transparency and consistency in the treatment \r\nof all States. A clear, rules-based financial system that \r\napplies to all States must be our collective goal.\r\nMy Government is mindful that without peace, \r\nthere can be no shared prosperity. We have aggressively \r\nconfronted the problem of crime and violence on several \r\nfronts. We condemn all acts of violence and support \r\nefforts to maintain peace. My Government will use \r\nevery resource available to achieve a stable, peaceful \r\nand equitable society, which is what our people expect \r\nand certainly deserve. Saint Kitts and Nevis supports \r\nthe calls for diplomacy aimed at addressing the \r\nconflicts around the world and is particularly heartened \r\nby the welcome dialogue on the Korean peninsula. The \r\nCaribbean is a zone of peace, and our clear philosophy \r\nis to promote peace, friendship and dialogue while \r\navoiding conflict with other territories. In that regard, \r\na denuclearized world is a most desirable objective for \r\nall humankind.\r\nThroughout the Caribbean, we suffer from an \r\nincrease in crime connected to the trade in small arms, \r\nlight weapons and drugs. Those weapons f low into the \r\nCaribbean, where they are not manufactured, and are \r\nlinked to an insatiable drug appetite in the West. It is \r\nbeyond our power to unilaterally control the f low of \r\nguns into the region or the addiction that drives the \r\ndangerous global drug trade. We seek the assistance \r\nof the international community as we work tirelessly \r\nto address that scourge. My country remains fully \r\ncommitted to the Arms Trade Treaty. Our increasing \r\ninternal budget allocations are an indication of our \r\ncommitment to the maintenance of safety and security.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is delighted that this \r\nweek, this body joined in committing to scaling up \r\nmulti-stakeholder and multisectoral responses aimed \r\nat the prevention and control of non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs), in the context of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. Our region remains \r\nencumbered by the unfortunate burden that the NCDs \r\nhave placed on our society and economy. The statistics \r\nare stark and startling. Eight of every 10 deaths in the \r\nCaribbean are attributable to NCDs, 40 per cent of \r\nwhich are premature and 70 per cent of that number are \r\npreventable. Hypertension is our leading risk factor for \r\ndeath. The Caribbean region’s diabetes rate is double \r\nthe global rate. We are facing an NCD crisis in our \r\nregion. In that regard, we applaud the launch earlier this \r\nweek of the Defeat-NCD Partnership, and the Caribbean \r\nCommunity and the Caribbean Public Health Agency \r\nwill provide the fullest support to that new partnership.\r\nWe endorse a holistic approach to health, and I am \r\nhappy to report that we have moved into high gear to \r\nmake universal health coverage, which is an essential \r\ncomponent of global health, a reality for all citizens \r\nin Saint Kitts and Nevis. However, I must remind the \r\nAssembly that NCDs and climate change are two sides \r\nof the same coin. They are symptoms of the failure of \r\nthe current development paradigm.\r\nMy Government believes in making an equitable \r\nsociety a reality for all citizens in Saint Kitts and Nevis. \r\nIn keeping with our commitment to transform our world \r\nthrough the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nwe have endeavoured to create an equitable pathway by \r\nimproving the standard of living of the most vulnerable \r\nso that they can become self-sufficient and productive \r\ncitizens and residents.\r\nI cannot address this great body without \r\nrecognizing our dear friend, Taiwan. My Government \r\nviews the United Nations as an organization for all \r\npeople, including the people of Taiwan. We strongly \r\nbelieve that Taiwan has an important and continuing \r\nrole to play in international development strategies, as \r\nit has achieved great success in technology, agriculture, \r\nhealth and renewable energy. We advocate that Taiwan \r\nbe given space to add to the dialogue, progress and \r\nwell-being of the global community. We also continue \r\nto voice our support for our Caribbean sister, Cuba, and \r\ncall for the normalization of relations between Cuba \r\nand the United States of America in order to alleviate \r\nthe real suffering caused to the Cuban people by the \r\npolicy of exclusion. My country is conscious of the \r\ncurrent difficulties in Venezuela. Venezuela has been a \r\nvery good friend to the Caribbean, and Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis continues to call for peaceful dialogue aimed at \r\nresolving the issues in that country, with due regard to \r\nthe rule of law and the democratic ideals that we hold \r\ndear.\r\nAs I conclude, I must remind the Assembly that our \r\npeople want action. They want results. We need to see \r\nall global leaders come together to create and maintain \r\nstability, equality and peace in our countries so that \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n4/65 18-30110\r\nour collective contributions can prevent and avoid war \r\nand violence, end the proliferation of nuclear weapons, \r\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and create a level \r\nplaying field, enabling small States to thrive. May we \r\nbe always mindful and proactive so as to ensure that no \r\ncountry is left behind in the pursuit and achievement of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda.\r\nIt is our shared responsibility to create the best \r\nopportunities and fulfil the expectations of our current \r\nand future generations. I am convinced that if we \r\ncontinue to work steadfastly, while always remaining \r\nvigilant and focused on the overarching goals, we will \r\ncontribute to a more relevant, fair, productive and \r\nmeaningful United Nations and, by extension, a better \r\nworld for all our peoples.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Sustainable Development, National \r\nSecurity, People Empowerment and Constituency \r\nEmpowerment of Saint Kitts and Nevis for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Timothy S. Harris, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Sustainable Development, National \r\nSecurity, People Empowerment and Constituency \r\nEmpowerment of Saint Kitts and Nevis, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hubert Alexander Minnis, \r\nPrime Minister of the Commonwealth of the \r\nBahamas\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth \r\nof the Bahamas.\r\nMr. Hubert Alexander Minnis, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Commonwealth of the Bahamas, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Hubert Alexander \r\nMinnis, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of the \r\nBahamas, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Minnis (Bahamas): I congratulate the President \r\non her election to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-third session. I wish to assure her and \r\nmembers of the Assembly of my delegation’s support. \r\nI commend Secretary-General António Guterres, who \r\ncontinues to guide the Organization through a process \r\nof reform that is vital for the continued relevance of our \r\nOrganization. I also pay tribute to the late Kofi Annan \r\nfor the immense contribution he made to the United \r\nNations and the global community.\r\nThis year, as we mark the 100th anniversary of the \r\nend of the First World War, it is fitting that the theme for \r\nthis seventy-third session is “Making the United Nations \r\nrelevant to all people: global leadership and shared \r\nresponsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties”. One of the painful lessons learned from the \r\ntwo world wars was the necessity for nations to work \r\ntogether to minimize conflicts and promote economic \r\nand social development. The relevance of the United \r\nNations to the global community is without question. \r\nThat is not to say that we ought not to strive to achieve \r\nmore — it is imperative that we do.\r\nAs nations, we must intensify our deliberations and \r\ncommitments to addressing climate change. Climate \r\nchange is a clear and present danger to us all, but in \r\nparticular to low-lying coastal nations like the Bahamas. \r\nWe see that in the rising sea levels, the loss of coral \r\nreefs and the increased volume of acid in our oceans, \r\nas well as the more severe and frequent hurricanes \r\nand typhoons. This time last year, the Bahamas, along \r\nwith many countries in the Caribbean and parts of \r\nthe United States of America, faced the onslaught of \r\nhurricanes of category 4 or higher. As Hurricane Irma \r\nhurtled towards the Bahamas, my Government took \r\nthe difficult decision to evacuate residents from the \r\nsouthern islands in order to prevent injury and the loss \r\nof life. We fortunately escaped without loss of life, but \r\nour southern neighbours were not as fortunate. As such, \r\nI fully support the Secretary-General’s plan to call a \r\nclimate summit next September to mobilize action and \r\nfinancial support.\r\nAs part of such discussions, we must dedicate \r\nconsiderably more energy and resources to building the \r\nresilience and sustainability of our island and coastal \r\nnations. Like our neighbours, the Bahamas is trying to \r\nrebuild its islands. However, the accumulated damage \r\nof a series of major hurricanes has made that very \r\ndifficult. As an archipelago of many islands stretching \r\napproximately 600 miles from north to south, we are \r\nrequired to replicate infrastructure many times over \r\nwith already limited resources.\r\nWhile the delivery of humanitarian aid is essential, \r\nit is equally important to focus on prevention and the \r\nstrengthening of capacity-building. Such a focus must \r\nbe grounded in a comprehensive approach to sustainable \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 5/65\r\ndevelopment that addresses, in an integrated manner, \r\nthe range of issues that are critical to the Bahamas, \r\nfrom disaster-risk reduction to the sustainable use of \r\nthe world’s seas and oceans, in order to ensure their \r\nviability for generations to come. Tourism is the \r\nworld’s largest industry. It is also the lifeblood of the \r\nBahamian economy. Millions of tourists travel to the \r\nBahamas annually because of our beautiful turquoise \r\nwaters and biodiversity. In that context, the Bahamas \r\nhas committed to banning single-use plastics by 2020.\r\nThe Bahamas looks forward to the successful \r\noutcomes of the review of the Small Island Developing \r\nStates Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway, the \r\ninternational framework that seeks to advance those and \r\nother sustainable development priorities for small island \r\ndeveloping States. The Bahamas will also advocate for a \r\nstrong outcome at the intergovernmental conference on \r\nan international, legally binding instrument under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.\r\nEarlier this week, I participated in the Bloomberg \r\nround table on building resilient economies and \r\npreserving marine ecosystems in coastal Commonwealth \r\nnations. I commend such dialogues. However, I must \r\nstress that the Bahamas and our neighbours are being \r\npunished twice for circumstances that are not of our own \r\nmaking. It is not our island nations that are primarily \r\nresponsible for the climate change that has resulted \r\nin the recent scourges of hurricanes and other natural \r\ndisasters that ravage our islands. However, when we \r\nrespond to national needs by borrowing internationally, \r\nseeking to restore basic human infrastructure, our \r\ndebt to gross domestic product ratio rises, risking \r\nthe possibility of a rating downgrade. That limits our \r\nability to provide for ourselves, but we are burdened \r\nwith a price tag too heavy to be borne.\r\nA relevant United Nations should urgently facilitate \r\na meaningful dialogue on the international stage to \r\nestablish a workable solution. Furthermore, the adverse \r\nimpact of global financial inequity is seen in the use \r\nof the distorted matrix of the per capita gross domestic \r\nproduct as a measure of national wealth and viability. \r\nThat is done without due regard being given to a country’s \r\nvulnerabilities and the weight that should be accorded \r\nto local circumstances. We remain concerned and \r\ndisappointed that the application of that matrix causes \r\nthe Bahamas to be assessed as being economically \r\nstronger than the threshold level for contributions from \r\ninternational financial organizations and for receiving \r\ngrants and international assistance when disasters \r\nstrike. The United Nations must devote greater focus \r\nand action to that inequitable issue.\r\nWe also reaffirm our support for Cuba’s ability \r\nto access resources for development to rebuild after \r\ndisasters. Similarly, notwithstanding the strong \r\nand unwavering commitment to the integrity of our \r\nfinancial-services industry, the Bahamas, like other \r\njurisdictions, is fighting an uphill battle to avoid being \r\nblacklisted as a non-cooperative jurisdiction for tax \r\npurposes. The goalposts for cooperation are constantly \r\nbeing moved. They are being inequitably applied with \r\nunfair advantages to some and disadvantages to others. \r\nThe Bahamas remains committed to international \r\ntax transparency and cooperation, the exchange of \r\ninformation and international regulatory standards, as \r\nwell as to conducting business in a fair, transparent and \r\ncompetitive manner.\r\nThe Bahamas comprehensively seeks to \r\nprovide greater opportunities to our disadvantaged \r\nurban centres through revitalization, economic \r\nempowerment and poverty-alleviation initiatives. \r\nThose initiatives have been designed to be consistent \r\nwith the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). My \r\nGovernment is committed to achieving the SDGs and \r\nwill continue to work with the United Nations and our \r\nother international partners and domestic stakeholders \r\ntowards their implementation.\r\nThe Bahamas is dedicated to serving as a \r\nproductive presence and committed member of the \r\nCouncil of the International Maritime Organization. \r\nWe have presented our candidature for re-election in \r\ncategory C in the 2019 elections. The Bahamas intends \r\nto continue its efforts to make positive and innovative \r\ncontributions towards ensuring the safety and security \r\nof shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by \r\nmaritime vessels.\r\nThe Bahamas remains committed to the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights and gender equality. \r\nThe geographical location of the Bahamas has made us \r\nparticularly vulnerable to illegal migration. We have \r\nbeen embattled by that problem for decades. However, \r\nwe are firmly resolved to fight illegal migration and \r\nto do so in a manner that prioritizes the safety and \r\nsecurity of the Bahamas, while adhering to human \r\nrights principles. The Bahamas is committed to the \r\nuse of information communication technology to \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n6/65 18-30110\r\nsupport development. We have offered ourselves as \r\nthe smart choice with our candidature for the Council \r\nof the International Telecommunication Union. \r\nThe Bahamas has been endorsed by our Caribbean \r\nCommunity neighbours.\r\nThe world continues to make progress in myriad \r\nareas of economic, political and social development. \r\nBut progress requires the eternal vigilance of each \r\ngeneration, a recommitment to upholding the dignity \r\nand equality of all people and unrelenting international \r\ncooperation. I wish to reaffirm the commitment of the \r\nBahamas to the principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Hubert Alexander Minnis, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Commonwealth of the Bahamas, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Thomas Motsoahae Thabane, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Lesotho.\r\nMr. Thomas Motsoahae Thabane, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcome His Excellency Mr. Thomas Motsoahae \r\nThabane, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Thabane (Lesotho): Allow me at the outset \r\nto sincerely congratulate the President on her well-\r\ndeserved election as the fourth woman to ascend to \r\nthe highest seat at the United Nations. Although we \r\nare happy about her election, we can certainly take no \r\npride in our own record as leaders. Out of 73 Presidents \r\nof General Assembly sessions to date, only four have \r\nbeen women. Nevertheless, all is not lost. We must \r\nresolve to walk the talk and ensure that women get the \r\nsame opportunities as men, in line with the spirit of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nI assure the President of my delegation’s full \r\nsupport. Her impeccable credentials and experience \r\nspanning more than two decades in the multilateral \r\nsetting assure us of a successful seventy-third session. It \r\nwould be remiss of me not to commend her predecessor, \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák, for his noteworthy leadership \r\nduring the previous session. I also wish to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/73/1), which outlines the state of our \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWorld history has been replete, since time \r\nimmemorial, with periods when peace was lacking. It \r\nspeaks of conflict among brothers and sisters — wars \r\nbetween and within nations. Terrorism and violence \r\nhave disrupted and displaced families, while economic \r\ndevastation has ruined countless lives. Natural disasters \r\nsuch as earthquakes, f loods and tornadoes caused by \r\nclimate change have taken their toll on humankind. \r\nInjustice continues to permeate countries, and societies \r\nare left devoid of hope for a prosperous, free, peaceful \r\nand just world. As new wars and civil unrest seem to \r\nbe f laring up every week, our people look to us as their \r\nleaders for solutions, and they yearn for help from the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIt is in that context that we welcome the theme for \r\nthis session — “Making the United Nations relevant to \r\nall people: global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. The \r\ntheme speaks to the very principles underpinning the \r\nformation of the Organization. The Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations puts people at the centre of the United \r\nNations with the following words in its Preamble: “We \r\nthe peoples of the United Nations”. The big question \r\ntoday is: have we put the people at the centre of our \r\nefforts as an Organization for more than seven decades?\r\nAs the session of 51 representatives who came \r\nfrom across the world to adopt the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations in 1945 was drawing to a close, the then \r\nPresident of the United States, Harry Truman, said:\r\n“The Charter of the United Nations which you have \r\njust signed is a solid structure upon which we can \r\nbuild a better world. ... Between the victory in Europe \r\nand the final victory, in this most destructive of all \r\nwars, you have won a victory against war itself. \r\n... With this Charter the world can begin to look \r\nforward to the time when all worthy human beings \r\nmay be permitted to live decently as free people.” \r\n(Proceedings of the United Nations Conference on \r\nInternational Organization, final plenary session, \r\nSan Francisco, 1945)\r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 7/65\r\nFor the past 73 years now, we have been standing at \r\nthis rostrum making commitments and inspiring hope \r\namong the citizens of the world. However, our rhetoric \r\nhas not been matched with action. Our lack of fidelity \r\nto the principles enshrined in the Charter remains a \r\nconcern. Seven decades on, we are still embroiled in \r\nvicious conflict and violence. The world envisioned \r\nby our forebears, where “worthy human beings may \r\nbe permitted to live decently as free people” (ibid.), \r\ncontinues to elude us. The multilateral system seems \r\nto provide no sustainable solution to the multifaceted \r\nchallenges that confront our world, while unilateralism \r\nis on the rise. Those challenges put to the test the trust \r\nthat humanity has put in the United Nations. Their hope \r\nthat future generations will be saved from the scourge \r\nof war, which, as stated in the Preamble to the Charter, \r\nhas twice in our lifetime brought untold sorrow to \r\nmankind, is further receding from sight.\r\nThe above scenario is a reality. Even so, the \r\ncentrality and relevance of the United Nations cannot \r\nbe challenged. The world would not have been the \r\nsame without the United Nations. Imperfect as it is, \r\nits positive impact on the lives of countless people is \r\na fact that cannot be denied. From feeding more than \r\n104 million people in over 80 countries every year to \r\nassisting millions of refugees and protecting women \r\nand children, fighting against poverty, HIV and AIDS, \r\nand restoring calm through peacekeeping initiatives, \r\nthe United Nations has undoubtedly made a difference \r\nin the lives of global citizens.\r\nWhen addressing the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session (see A/72/PV.17), I did so with \r\na heavy heart, as there was a dark cloud of instability \r\nand insecurity hovering over my country. But today, I \r\nstand before the Assembly to attest to the difference \r\nthat the United Nations can make in people’s lives. With \r\nthe help of the United Nations, the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community, the African Union and other \r\ndevelopment partners, we are on the path to changing \r\nthe trajectory of a vicious circle of instability and \r\nvolatile insecurity in Lesotho. The Kingdom of Lesotho \r\nis now embarking on a comprehensive national reform \r\nagenda that will culminate in the calibration of pivotal \r\nelements of Government, and thus achieve the tenets \r\nof the National Vision 2020. Our shared commitment \r\nas a nation to transforming our mountain kingdom \r\ninto a just, prosperous and stable country, marked by \r\neffective and people-focused institutions, national \r\nunity of purpose, the rule of law, good governance and \r\nhuman rights, will certainly be attained.\r\nOur resolve to build a safe, stable and secure \r\ncountry is motivated  by the fact that peace and security \r\nare preconditions for development. We are determined \r\nto take charge of our socioeconomic transformation \r\nas a country, in line with the African Union Agenda \r\n2063, as well as the United Nations 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development — premised upon the \r\nprinciple of inclusivity and leaving no one behind. \r\nWe note, however, the important role that financing \r\nplays in any attempt to achieve the goals enshrined \r\nin both Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda. While \r\nwe acknowledge that official development assistance \r\nremains a catalyst for development, we also advocate \r\nfor robust domestic resource mobilization. We are \r\ndetermined to combat illicit financial f lows, strengthen \r\ntax administration and harness remittances.\r\nIn line with our national priorities, we are taking \r\nsubstantive steps towards providing an appropriate space \r\nfor private-sector investment and entrepreneurship as a \r\ncomplement to public investments. An industrial hub \r\nhas been launched in the northern region. When fully \r\noperational, it will create job opportunities for more \r\nthan 14,000 people. Private property investors will also \r\nbe invited to build factory shells there.\r\nWe also cannot ignore the disturbing issue of \r\nmigration. We all know that the movement of persons \r\nacross borders is an issue of staggering importance. It is \r\nour view that migration is one area where opportunities \r\nfor skilled and surplus labour can be explored. To \r\nthat end, my Government is working closely with \r\ninternational partners to explore development outcomes \r\nrelated to migration. In addition, a national consultative \r\ncommittee was set up to deal with a range of \r\nmigration-related matters, such as the development of a \r\nstrategic plan on migration and development. Included \r\nin the plan are interventions aimed at enhancing the \r\nproper utilization of remittances from the diaspora. We \r\ntherefore need to embrace migrants at the global level \r\nfor their contribution to the economic development of \r\nboth their countries of origin and their host countries. \r\nWe find it disturbing that migrants all over the world \r\ncontinue to face challenges of unprecedented magnitude. \r\nWe call upon all parties concerned to adhere to the \r\nglobal compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, \r\nand we look forward to the adoption of the compact \r\nin December.\r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n8/65 18-30110\r\nPeace and prosperity cannot be achieved when \r\nwomen and girls are marginalized and not given the \r\nopportunity to contribute to development. The role \r\nof women and other disadvantaged sectors of our \r\ncommunities in advancing the global development \r\nagenda must be further enhanced. It is equally important \r\nto underline that the protection of human rights is a \r\nnoble objective of the international community that \r\nmust not be politicized, redefined or even subjected to \r\ndouble standards according to the whims and caprices \r\nof a few powerful States pursuing their own agendas.\r\nToday on the African continent we are more \r\ndetermined than ever to rid ourselves of conflict by \r\nsettling disputes through peaceful means. The warring \r\nparties in South Sudan have finally brokered a peace \r\ndeal. The developments in the Horn of Africa offer hope \r\nfor a prosperous and peaceful region. In particular, the \r\nnormalization of relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea \r\nthrough the signing of a peace deal and the opening of \r\nembassies in both countries’ capitals will usher in a new \r\nera of peace, with substantial concomitant economic, \r\nhumanitarian and strategic implications for the region.\r\nWe continue to be saddened, however, by the \r\nsituation in Western Sahara, which continues to be the \r\nonly colony on the African continent. The suffering \r\nof the Sahrawi people has been going on for far too \r\nlong now. They deserve to be afforded an opportunity \r\nto voice their aspirations for independence through \r\nuniversal suffrage. Lesotho will continue to stand with \r\nthem in their pursuit of emancipation.\r\nAs the plight of the Palestinian people worsens, \r\nthe hope for the resolution of the crises in Syria and \r\nIraq also diminishes. We cannot remain indifferent \r\nto the suffering of those innocent people. Unilateral \r\nactions that defy international agreements and United \r\nNations resolutions will only worsen the situation of \r\nthe Palestinians. A two-State solution, with Palestine \r\nand Israel living side by side in peace and harmony, \r\nremains the only viable option for the settlement of the \r\nPalestinian question. Achieving peace is a process that \r\nrequires engagement, accommodation and genuineness. \r\nPeace cannot be achieved through war or oppression. \r\nAll of us joined this Organization voluntarily and \r\nprofessed a love for peace. Our actions must also reflect \r\nthat commitment.\r\nIn the same vein, the economic and commercial \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba continues to weigh heavily \r\non our conscience. There is no doubt that that measure \r\nhas had a negative impact on the people and the economy \r\nof Cuba. We call for the embargo to be lifted and for \r\nCuba to be reintegrated into the world trading system.\r\nIn today’s globalized world it is indefensible and \r\nincomprehensible that decisions that bind us all are left \r\nin the hands of a few Member States. Our advocacy \r\nfor the democratization of the United Nations must be \r\nintensified. Reform of the Security Council, one that \r\ntakes into account the aspirations of Africa, as set out \r\nin the Ezulwini Consensus, cannot be postponed any \r\nlonger. Transparency, inclusivity and democracy must \r\ninform the work of the entire United Nations system.\r\nIt is equally important to underscore that the gains \r\nmade in the field of disarmament are being eroded \r\ngradually. Small arms and light weapons continue \r\nto f lood the illegal market. The threat of the use of \r\nweapons of mass destruction has re-emerged, and \r\nthe United Nations is paralysed by the current size, \r\nallocation of membership and power configuration of \r\nthe Security Council, making the call for the reform of \r\nthat organ even more urgent.\r\nMr. Sokhonn (Cambodia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nIn conclusion, I note that the United Nations, to a \r\nvery large extent, has attempted to put people at the \r\ncentre of its core business. However, still more needs \r\nto be done. I appeal to all present to shun those who \r\nseek to divide and incite us against each other. It is \r\nthrough our solidarity, more than anything else, that \r\nthe United Nations will thrive and successfully put \r\nhumankind at the centre of its activities. The United \r\nNations is the only platform that enables us to embrace \r\ntrue multilateralism.\r\nAt the same time, let us remember that, although \r\nwe may have a shared vision and leadership determined \r\nto address peace, equity and sustainability challenges, \r\nthe truth is that we are mortal beings with intellectual \r\nand other constraints. As such, we need to acknowledge \r\nthat there is a divine Power above, which is the source of \r\ntrue wisdom. Let us therefore keep our communication \r\nlines with God open in order to find real and lasting \r\nsolutions to the world problems that so often besiege us.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Lesotho for the statement he has just made.\r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 9/65\r\nMr. Thomas Motsoahae Thabane, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Gaston Alphonso Browne, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Finance and \r\nCorporate Governance of Antigua and Barbuda\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Finance and Corporate Governance of Antigua \r\nand Barbuda.\r\nMr. Gaston Alphonso Browne, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Finance and Corporate Governance of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Gaston Alphonso \r\nBrowne, Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and \r\nCorporate Governance of Antigua and Barbuda, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Browne (Antigua and Barbuda): Year after \r\nyear, Government leaders from across the world \r\ntravel to this Hall in the United Nations in the hope \r\nof finding a pathway to universal peace and progress, \r\nwhich has persistently eluded us all. The people of our \r\nnations — rich and poor, large and small — have long \r\nsince stopped paying much attention to, or caring about, \r\nwhat is said here. For them this place is a talk shop \r\nwhere much is said and not enough is being done to \r\nchange their lives or give them good reason to believe \r\nthat a better life is coming. What they know is that \r\nthey live in a world in which 1 per cent of humankind \r\ncontrols more wealth than the other 99 per cent. What \r\nthey see is a world controlled by a few powerful nations \r\nthat impose their will on all the others in perpetuation \r\nof a system of sectional dominance.\r\nTo the children of Syria, Palestine, Israel, Yemen \r\nand Afghanistan who do not know a life without war, \r\nwithout bombs, without conflicts and without violent \r\nconfrontation, the promise of turning swords into \r\nploughshares is a meaningless phrase. To the people in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa and many parts of Latin America \r\nand Asia, the World Bank’s dream, emblazoned on its \r\ngrand entrance in Washington, D.C., of a world free of \r\npoverty, continues to be a nightmare they relive every \r\nwaking moment.\r\nThe fundamental undertaking by all nations, as set \r\nout in the Charter of the United Nations, namely,\r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in \r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, in the \r\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large \r\nand small”,\r\nstands in stark contradiction to the reality of refugees \r\nfrom Africa, Latin America and war-torn countries, \r\nwho are forced to f lee their homelands to try to cross \r\nthe borders of the rich — some literally in cages.\r\nWhy, then, did I travel to the United Nations? Why \r\nam I standing at this rostrum when I could be in my own \r\ncountry tending to its affairs and trying, as best I can, \r\nto improve my people’s lives? I am here because none \r\nof the crises I just described exists in isolation. Each \r\nof them engulfs us all, and at this forum, at least, I can \r\nraise my voice for the disadvantaged and dispossessed, \r\nincluding my own people in Antigua and Barbuda.\r\nHistory has taught us that no nation should \r\nbelieve that its individual oasis of wealth, prosperity \r\nand advantage can continue to exist and expand if \r\nthe rest of the globe is a wasteland. The reality is that \r\nthe world is a global neighbourhood. No place on our \r\nplanet is distant any longer, and neither are the issues \r\nthat plague it. The hopes and aspirations of all those \r\ncommunities — and, yes, their terrors, their torments \r\nand their fears — are shared by everyone. If they have \r\nnot yet reached Member States’ doorstep, at the rate we \r\nare going they are certainly coming soon.\r\nWalls around the rich cannot keep out diseases that \r\nare carried on the winds blowing from neglected pools \r\nof poverty. Migrants will not halt their determined trek \r\nfrom their homelands in search of better conditions \r\nuntil circumstances in their own countries improve. \r\nWhile the Governments and political parties in those \r\ncountries bear a great responsibility to respect and \r\nuphold the human, civil and political rights of their \r\ncitizens, the global community, particularly the \r\nrich, has an obligation to contribute to the economic \r\ndevelopment of those countries. Human freedoms, like \r\nfragile plants, even in the purest air cannot take root and \r\nthrive in conditions of deprivation and dispossession.\r\nFor all those reasons, our nations, collectively \r\nand acting in a united way, must act to improve the \r\nhuman condition. It is an imperative. That is why the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly is vital, urgent \r\nand important. For instance, without the inclusion \r\nof all States Members of the United Nations in the \r\ndiscussions on global financial reforms, there can be no \r\nreal comprehension of the grave vulnerability of small \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n10/65 18-30110\r\nStates to external shocks, high levels of poverty and \r\nhigh debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratios.\r\nA few privileged nations are making decisions that \r\nimpact the livelihoods of billions. The exclusive clubs \r\nof the Group of Seven and the Group of 20 cannot repair \r\nthe fragmented international financial system without \r\ntaking full account of the circumstances and views of \r\nthe majority of the world’s nations, and neither can the \r\nEuropean Commission, which now seeks to impose its \r\nown anti-competition, high-tax policies on developing \r\ncountries around the world.\r\nLimits on participation limit ideas, innovation \r\nand human development. Arbitrary rules set by \r\nunrepresentative bodies for their own narrow purposes \r\nhave no legitimacy in the world. The enforcement of \r\nthose arbitrary rules by the threats and sanctions of the \r\nmighty is not legitimate. It results only in grumbling \r\nand reluctant acquiescence that lacks enduring support. \r\nThe might exercised by enforcers does not make their \r\nactions right.\r\nThat is why the General Assembly must be \r\nrevitalized. Its revitalization would serve to give \r\nthis gathering relevance and would help address \r\nmeaningfully the indifference of the peoples of the \r\nworld towards the Organization, about which I spoke at \r\nthe beginning of this statement.\r\nThe special value of the General Assembly is its \r\nuniversality of membership and the fact that the voice of \r\nevery Member State can be raised, but it must be seen to \r\nbe more than a place for talk. It must be a place for action \r\nand for results. For years the General Assembly has \r\nbeen marginalized by the Security Council and by the \r\nnotion that a small group of powerful countries should \r\nmake decisions for the rest of the world. Where is the \r\ndemocracy in that type of behaviour? That erroneous \r\nthinking has crept into every multilateral organization. \r\nIt is so in the World Trade Organization (WTO); it is \r\nso in the International Monetary Fund; and it is so in \r\nthe World Bank. The General Assembly must become \r\nthe principal organ of the United Nations system — the \r\nonly system that every nation of the world accepts and \r\nto which they all subscribe.\r\nThat is what the Charter of the United Nations \r\npromised, and that is what nations expect. The failure to \r\ndeliver on that promise has undermined multilateralism \r\nand encouraged the abuse of power by the powerful few \r\nand has frustrated people all over the world. Unless the \r\nGeneral Assembly is revitalized and made relevant, the \r\nactions of the Security Council and other organizations \r\nwill be endured, but not embraced; they will be \r\naccepted, but not respected; and they will be enforced, \r\nbut not legitimized.\r\nDespite the risk of my call falling on deaf ears, I \r\nhereby make the call once again for a reinvigorated and \r\nrelevant General Assembly. I recognize that it would \r\nnot serve the interests of the powerful, who fear the \r\nexpression of dissent and the call for political rights, \r\nrights that many of the powerful demand should exist \r\nin other countries, but I would be neglectful of my duty \r\nof care and my responsibility to the poor and vulnerable \r\nand to the silenced and stif led if I did not raise this \r\nclarion call for greater and fairer representation for all \r\nthe world’s peoples.\r\nAs the leader of my country, I put its interests first. \r\nHowever, I know that in standing up for my country \r\nfirst it would be foolhardy to stand up for my country \r\nalone. That would be a dog-eat-dog policy that, if \r\npracticed by every nation, would result in short-term \r\ngains for the richer ones, but ultimately in losses for \r\nall. My country would soon run out of friends, run \r\nout of foreign investors and, more important, run out \r\nof markets for its goods and services. The analogy \r\napplies to countries much larger than mine, even the \r\nrichest and most powerful, even those who believe that \r\nthey are invincible. For when they have weakened all \r\nothers to strengthen themselves, to whom will they sell \r\ntheir goods and services and how will they maintain \r\ntheir high standard of living and increase their wealth? \r\nHumankind itself is our global community that provides \r\nall of us with enduring citizenship. Loyalty to myopic, \r\nnationalistic ideals cannot trump patriotism towards \r\nour common humankind.\r\nI recognize that today all nations of the world \r\nare interdependent in the effort to stop the spread of \r\ndisease, curb the effects of climate change, make our \r\npeoples safe from terrorists and organized crime, \r\nshare knowledge and technology and have access to \r\none another’s markets to trade in goods and services, \r\nthereby improving the lives of all people. Today’s world \r\nwill be able to maintain and broaden peace, security and \r\nprosperity only through international teamwork. There \r\nis no other way. No one nation, however powerful, \r\ncan go it alone. That is why my country supports \r\ndenuclearization by North Korea and Iran. It is why we \r\nwould like to see all countries eliminate their nuclear \r\narsenals. Global peace will not be won by a balance of \r\nterror, and that is what pointing nuclear warheads at \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 11/65\r\neach other is all about. It is a balance of terror. It is a \r\nzero-sum game that is playing with the survival of our \r\nplanet and all humankind. No one should be playing \r\nthat game, no matter how rich or powerful they are. In \r\nmy country’s own Caribbean region, we have strongly \r\nadvocated for a zone of peace. For too many centuries, \r\nour area has been the site of other peoples’ conflicts and \r\nambitions. We had no say in those conflicts, which have \r\nleft our region with a long shadow of stunted growth, \r\ndispossession and underdevelopment. We want no \r\nmore to be the theatre of the proxy wars of others. We \r\nwant the chance to grow and develop, to claim a place \r\nunder the sun and to make our unique contribution to \r\nhuman progress.\r\nFor that reason we welcome a recent visit to Cuba \r\nby the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \r\nCommittee of the United States, Mr. Bob Corker, to \r\ntalk about relations between the two countries. We \r\nunderstand that progress is never made in a straight \r\nline. There have been many zigs and many zags, but \r\nafter five decades of imposing a trade embargo on Cuba \r\nthe senselessness of that policy should be obvious to all. \r\nIt is time to end it and to provide the Cuban people with \r\nthe chance they have been so long denied to put their \r\nwell-known talents in medicine, the arts, music and \r\neducation at the disposal of all humankind. We again \r\ncall on the Congress of the United States to abandon the \r\noutdated trade embargo of Cuba and renew the avenues \r\nof dialogue and cooperation that offer beneficial \r\nprospects for the peoples of both countries, and by \r\nextension to all the Americas.\r\nIn the same vein, we urge all nations to recall \r\nthat the countries of the United Nations committed \r\nthemselves, 13 years ago, to the responsibility to \r\nprotect their own populations from genocide, war \r\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. \r\nWhat we did not do was to give any country or group of \r\ncountries the right to intervene uninvited in the affairs \r\nof any other country. We certainly did not authorize \r\nmilitary intervention in any way, shape or form. What \r\nwe agreed was that there is a collective responsibility to \r\nencourage and help each country uphold its individual \r\ncommitment to protect its own people, and we declared \r\nour preparedness to take timely and decisive action, in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations, to \r\nhelp them to do so.\r\nWe all know that, in the words of the Charter itself,\r\n“Nothing contained in the present Charter \r\nshall authorize the United Nations to intervene in \r\nmatters which are essentially within the domestic \r\njurisdiction of any state”.\r\nIn that connection, when the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-third session once again discusses this \r\nmatter, we must strongly discourage bellicose talk of \r\nmilitary intervention in any State by any other State \r\nor group of States. The responsibility to protect must \r\nnot be used as political cover for vigilante action to \r\njustify intervention in any country. The encouragement \r\nof military interventions would mortally wound the \r\nUnited Nations as a legitimate and effective body. That \r\nis a prospect to be firmly eschewed. Therefore, when \r\nand if the United Nations decides that democracy and \r\nhuman rights have been emasculated by tyranny in \r\nany country, it is the United Nations collectively that \r\nmust authorize and carry out any agreed action. In the \r\nwords of former United States Republican President \r\nDwight Eisenhower:\r\n“If the United Nations once admits that international \r\ndisputes can be settled by using force, then we will \r\nhave destroyed the foundation of the Organization \r\nand our best hope of establishing a world order.”\r\nThe United Nations must always be a manifestation \r\nof the better angels of our common humanity, through \r\nwhich we must seek a world of security and freedom \r\ngoverned by justice and moral law. Together we must \r\nassert the pre-eminence of right over might and the \r\ngeneral good over narrow sectional aims. That is \r\nwhy my country calls for a renewed commitment to \r\nmultilateralism and a rejection of trade wars. Goods \r\nand services together represent more than 28 per cent \r\nof the global gross domestic product, but the escalation \r\nof trade wars will lead to severe disruption across the \r\nglobe. No country will be spared and, incidentally, the \r\nworst affected will be those that wage those wars. That \r\ndisruption has already started, and its effects are being \r\nfelt globally.\r\nAlready, even though my country is not involved \r\nin any trade war with anyone, it is experiencing the \r\ndownside of trade wars between our trading partners, \r\nas prices of our imports from them rise, pushing up \r\nthe cost of living. The World Trade Organization is \r\nnot a perfect mechanism for solving trade disputes, \r\nbut walking away from it and tearing it down would \r\ndo nothing except to destabilize the world’s trading \r\nsystem, which is fundamental to the well-being of \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n12/65 18-30110\r\nall. It is up to all nations, rich and poor, to make the \r\nsystem work by improving it and by honouring their \r\nindividual commitments.\r\nFifteen years after winning an arbitration at the \r\nWTO, my little country is still awaiting an acceptable \r\nsettlement by the United States to honour its obligation \r\nto us. That is right — 15 years later we are still waiting. \r\nThe United States economy is 20,000 times larger than \r\nthat of Antigua and Barbuda. The compensation for the \r\ninjury to my small country is less than 0.008 per cent \r\nof one year of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the \r\nUnited States. The injury that was done to my country’s \r\neconomy now amounts to over 20 per cent of its GDP. No \r\ncountry can easily absorb that severe a blow, which hurts \r\nour economy, sets back our infrastructural development \r\nand constrains the provision of employment and \r\nadvances in health and education. That my people have \r\nbeen able to survive that pain speaks to their resilience, \r\nof which I am extremely proud, but they should not be \r\nmade to endure it.\r\nOf course, the WTO is powerless to enforce its own \r\nawards, and my country has no means to do so. We rely \r\non respect for the international system, adherence to \r\ninternational law and the conscience of the mighty to \r\ndo right to the weak whom they have injured. That is a \r\nstruggle in which my country will continue to engage. \r\nWe will not relent. And we will do so not in anger or \r\nin enmity, but in calm and in comity until justice is \r\nachieved. We owe it to our small island community not \r\nto rest until justice is done. As I said before, we will not \r\nrelent on that issue.\r\nIn the context of justice, the refusal by some \r\ncountries, particularly those that are the worst \r\ncontributors to greenhouse-gas emissions, to admit \r\nto the harmful effects of climate change and to take \r\nremedial action is an act of injustice. Small countries \r\nsuch as Antigua and Barbuda contribute the least to \r\nharmful carbon emissions — less than 0.01 per cent. \r\nYet, along with other small States in the Caribbean \r\nand the Pacific, we are its greatest victims. The injury \r\nto our countries continues without compensation, \r\ncausing our economies to decline, creating refugees \r\nwithin our States, scaring away foreign investors, \r\nescalating the costs of insurance and rebuilding and \r\nincreasing the level of our debt. Those are the realities \r\nof climate change.\r\nLast year’s hurricane season cost the Caribbean \r\nregion more than  $150 billion. To put that in perspective, \r\nthe overall economy of the 14 States members of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) totals $80 billion. \r\nThat means that the damage to countries within our \r\nsubregion last year alone was almost twice the size of \r\nall our economies combined. Almost a year ago today, \r\na CARICOM-United Nations high-level pledging \r\nconference was convened to assist Caribbean countries \r\nthat were affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. \r\nBillions of dollars were pledged, although they \r\nwere insufficient to meet the costs. More important, \r\nunfortunately, less than half of the pledges have been \r\ndelivered. Reconstruction is far from done; rebuilding \r\nlives and livelihoods will challenge us for some time to \r\ncome. Where is the justice?\r\nThe Caribbean has been fortunate this year in \r\nthat we have so far survived the hurricane season. \r\nWe watched in anguish and with enormous sympathy \r\nand empathy the destruction wrought by Hurricane \r\nFlorence on the Carolinas in the United States. We \r\nmourned the loss of lives — a pain we know only too \r\nwell. What the destruction of the Carolinas this year \r\nand the ruin of Caribbean countries last year served to \r\nemphasize to us is that borders may separate nations but \r\nthey do not insulate them from the shared dangers of \r\nclimate change. Sovereignty and patriotism do not give \r\nsanctuary from calamity; disaster befalls the wealthy as \r\nwell as the poor.\r\nThat is why we continue to urge for a global \r\npolicy dialogue that integrates the environment \r\nwith development and that accepts the fundamental \r\nunderstanding that every country — with no \r\nexceptions — must play a meaningful role, within its \r\nmeans, to stop the persistent deterioration of our lives \r\ncaused by climate change. The problem is global, and it \r\nrequires a global solution. It requires the commitment \r\nof all. What the world needs is a recommitment to \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change, including a \r\ncommitment to the replenishment of the Green Climate \r\nFund and the Adaptation Fund.\r\nOn behalf of the people of my country, the people of \r\nthe Caribbean and Pacific islands, the people who live \r\nin the eye of storms such as those aff licting the eastern \r\nseaboard of the United States, I urge all countries \r\nto come to the table of dialogue and to stand by the \r\nagreements we have made and the treaties we sign. \r\nOur shared planet and our common humanity depend \r\nupon it.\r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 13/65\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Antigua \r\nand Barbuda for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Gaston Alphonso Browne, Prime Minister \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Pavel Filip, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Moldova\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Moldova.\r\nMr. Pavel Filip, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Mr. Pavel Filip, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Moldova, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Filip (Republic of Moldova) (spoke in \r\nMoldovan; English text provided by the delegation): I \r\nwould like to begin by congratulating Her Excellency \r\nMs. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session and to wish her success in fulfilling her \r\nimportant mandate. Furthermore, I would like to thank \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák for the fruitful actions he carried \r\nout in his capacity as President of the General Assembly \r\nduring the previous session and to wish him success in \r\nhis future endeavours.\r\nI take this opportunity to pay tribute to the late \r\nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a true leader \r\nand promoter of United Nations values, who will \r\nremain in the memory of the Organization as one of \r\nthe most distinguished and dedicated supporters of \r\nhumanitarianism and global peace.\r\nFor more than 70 years, the United Nations has \r\nbeen at the centre of multilateral diplomacy, playing \r\na primary role in global processes from international \r\npeace and security to the promotion of human rights \r\nand sustainable development. While the international \r\nenvironment continues to evolve, now is a crucial \r\nmoment in which the United Nations must adapt itself \r\nin order to meet the challenges of the modern world. \r\nHence we welcome the initiatives of Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres, which he has been carrying out \r\nsince his first day in office. In particular, we welcome \r\nthe reform aimed at enhancing the performance of \r\nthe Secretariat in the area of international peace \r\nand security by focusing on conflict prevention as a \r\ntop priority. Furthermore, we support the efforts to \r\nreform United Nations management by streamlining \r\nfunctions and increasing the accountability of all of \r\nthe branches of the Secretariat in the fulfilment of \r\ntheir mandate. Finally, the recent decision to reposition \r\nthe United Nations development system by enabling it \r\nto effectively contribute to the implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, which were agreed \r\nthree years ago, is particularly important.\r\nUndoubtedly, those initiatives are very complex \r\nand will bring systemic changes across the entire \r\nOrganization. In order to ensure that those reforms \r\nyield the expected results in the medium and long \r\nterms, transparent and constructive dialogue among \r\nUnited Nations management and States Members of the \r\nOrganization must continue.\r\nThe implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development will definitely be a milestone \r\nin the work of the Organization for years to come. The \r\nreform of the United Nations development system comes \r\nat a time when the implementation of that Agenda must \r\nbe accelerated at all levels in a joint effort of the United \r\nNations system and Member States.\r\nWe welcome the new reform vision by which the \r\nprivate sector will be more actively involved in the \r\nachievement of sustainable development at the global, \r\nregional and national levels. That partnership has the \r\npotential to provide a new impetus for progress and \r\ninnovation, including for financial mobilization aimed \r\nat filling the funding gaps that the Organization is \r\ncurrently facing.\r\nBearing in mind the Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the Government of the Republic of \r\nMoldova has developed, through an inclusive and \r\nparticipatory process, a vision of a new development \r\nstrategy called Moldova 2030, which is fully aligned \r\nwith its international commitments, including the \r\nMoldova-European Union Association Agreement. That \r\nnew development strategy highlights the well-being and \r\nhuman rights of our citizens and the protection of the \r\nenvironment, as well as cultivating an inclusive society, \r\nas its top priorities.\r\nThere are several ongoing projects aimed at realizing \r\nthose objectives. We are currently implementing an \r\nambitious national programme to rehabilitate the road \r\ninfrastructure across the country in order to improve \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n14/65 18-30110\r\nthe connectivity and mobility of people, goods and \r\nservices. We are introducing greater innovation and \r\ntechnology in public services for greater accessibility, \r\nbetter quality and transparency and in order to \r\neliminate corruption.\r\nWe have taken an important step forward towards \r\nthe integration of the Republic of Moldova into the \r\nEuropean energy market by signing an agreement with \r\nthe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \r\nfor the financing of the largest energy project in \r\nthe Republic of Moldova since its independence. \r\nThe country’s energy independence is crucial to its \r\nsustainable development and social stability. We are \r\nworking actively with our international partners, \r\nincluding United Nations agencies and programmes \r\nin the area of the environment, to continually develop \r\nrenewable energy and reduce gas emissions in \r\naccordance with our international commitments. Given \r\nthe complexity of the 2030 Agenda, we are pursuing \r\nseveral other initiatives as part of our comprehensive \r\nsustainable development vision, which we are \r\nimplementing together with the United Nations and our \r\npartners, in line with the new integrated approach.\r\nWhile the United Nations managed to establish \r\na vision for reform in the field of development in \r\nthe General Assembly resolution adopted last May \r\n(resolution 72/91), in the security sphere, where \r\npolitical factors are more predominant, deficiencies \r\npersist. The effectiveness and relevance of the United \r\nNations in that area cannot be fully achieved simply \r\nthrough the internal restructuring of its Secretariat. \r\nThe delay in the reform of the Security Council over \r\nthe past 25 years has not contributed to respect for the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, international law or the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, which \r\nare the core prerogatives of the Organization.\r\nWe follow with great concern the violent conflicts \r\nthat are taking place in various parts of the world \r\nwith severe consequences for the civilian population. \r\nThe inability of the Security Council to take effective \r\nmeasures in those situations raises a legitimate question \r\nabout its relevance as a decision-making body for \r\ninternational security. From that perspective, reform \r\nis key to restoring the relevance and authority of the \r\nSecurity Council and, by extension, that of the entire \r\nUnited Nations, in matters of international peace and \r\nsecurity. The Republic of Moldova supports the vision \r\nof an effective, representative, democratic and inclusive \r\nSecurity Council that is capable of swiftly responding \r\nto complex security challenges. Furthermore, as we \r\nhave stated several times in the past, we advocate for \r\nthe designation of an additional non-permanent seat in \r\nthe Council to the Group of Eastern European States. \r\nAnd we hope that the membership of the General \r\nAssembly will come to an agreement on outstanding \r\nreform issues sooner rather than later.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations requires the \r\nOrganization to play a proactive role in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security and in ensuring respect \r\nfor Member States’ sovereignty and territorial integrity. \r\nBy bringing matters arising from challenges to their \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and national security \r\nbefore the General Assembly, Member States do not \r\nseek confrontation or the politicization of the work of \r\nthe Assembly. It is only natural for such States to turn \r\nto the United Nations for assistance in promoting and \r\nencouraging solutions based on the strict observance of \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nDuring the high-level segment of the seventy-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly, I reiterated, \r\nfrom this high rostrum, the calls to the United Nations \r\nto focus meaningfully on a grave breach of international \r\nlaw and the Charter of the United Nations, namely, \r\nthe continued presence of Russian military forces and \r\narmaments on the territory of the Republic of Moldova \r\nwithout our consent and against our express wishes \r\n(see A/72/PV.15). I also appealed to Member States to \r\nsupport the inclusion of an item focused on that pressing \r\npolitical, legal and security issue for the Republic of \r\nMoldova in the agenda of General Assembly. I am \r\npleased to note that the General Assembly adopted a \r\nresolution that declared in a straightforward manner \r\nthe incompatibility of the political preconditions that \r\nunderpin the Russian Federation’s continuing refusal \r\nto withdraw its military forces and armaments from \r\nMoldovan soil with the norms of international law and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations (resolution 72/282). \r\nBy adopting that resolution, on 22 June, the General \r\nAssembly also unequivocally stressed that the Russian \r\nFederation’s non-compliance with international law \r\nand the Charter of the United Nations has led to a clear \r\nviolation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nthe Republic of Moldova and that Russia must withdraw \r\nits military forces unconditionally, completely and \r\nwithout further delay. The resolution is a first and \r\nimportant milestone for consolidating the support of \r\nthe United Nations for the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of the Republic of Moldova. In that context, \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 15/65\r\nI would like to express our deep gratitude to all of \r\nthe Member States that sponsored that resolution or \r\nsupported its adoption.\r\nLast week, following the recommendation by the \r\nGeneral Committee, the General Assembly decided by \r\nconsensus to include in the agenda of the seventy-third \r\nsession a new item entitled “Complete withdrawal of \r\nforeign military forces from the territory of the Republic \r\nof Moldova” (see A/73/PV.3). The Government of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova welcomes that important decision, \r\nwhich comes at a time when internal and subregional \r\nsecurity has worsened owing to the repeated, unlawful \r\nand destabilizing activities undertaken by the foreign \r\nmilitary forces and the unconstitutional power \r\nstructures in the eastern part of the country. The \r\nmilitary exercises conducted jointly by the operational \r\ngroup of Russian forces in Moldova, which are \r\nstationed illegally on our soil, and the paramilitaries \r\nof the unconstitutional power structures have increased \r\nin scope and frequency, which represents a continued \r\nviolation of the 1992 Moldovan-Russian ceasefire \r\nagreement, which includes an explicit legally binding \r\ncommitment on the part of the Russian Federation to \r\nensure the neutrality of Russian military forces during \r\nthe process of their withdrawal from the territory of \r\nthe Republic of Moldova. The illegal joint military \r\nexercises are aimed at upgrading the military-offensive \r\ncapacity of the unconstitutional power structures and at \r\nundermining international efforts aimed at the peaceful \r\nresolution of the protracted Transnistrian problem. \r\nOther States members of the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have echoed the \r\nRepublic of Moldova in its repeated expressions of deep \r\nconcern with regard to those unlawful and ongoing \r\ndestabilizing exercises, which run contrary to the \r\nobligations undertaken by the Russian Federation in the \r\nframework of the 5+2 international settlement format.\r\nFrom this rostrum today, we appeal once again to \r\nthe Russian Federation to discontinue those illegal and \r\nprovocative activities and to resume, unconditionally \r\nand without further delay, the process of withdrawing \r\nits troops and armaments, in accordance with its legal \r\ncommitments under the 1999 OSCE Istanbul summit \r\noutcome document and in observance of its obligations \r\nunder international law and the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThe complete and unconditional withdrawal \r\nof foreign military forces from the territory of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova will undoubtedly facilitate the \r\nprocess of settling the Transnistrian conflict and help \r\nreintegrate the country. Despite the many difficulties \r\nencountered in the settlement process, the Moldovan \r\nauthorities are determined to find a political solution \r\nto the protracted, externally generated conflict in the \r\neastern part of the Republic of Moldova, within the 5+2 \r\nnegotiating format. For us, it is extremely important \r\nthat that solution be based on full respect for the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, with the provision of a special status for the \r\nTransnistrian region, as stipulated in the relevant OSCE \r\ndocuments.\r\nI would now like to refer briefly to the goal of \r\nEuropean integration, which guides the reform agenda \r\nof my country, particularly through the application of \r\nthe Association Agreement with the European Union \r\n(EU). By aligning the Republic of Moldova with EU \r\nprinciples and standards and by harmonizing Moldovan \r\nnational legislation with European legislation, we aim \r\nto bring our country closer to the EU and to ensure the \r\nsustainability of the modernization process.\r\nThe extent of our cooperation with the EU is \r\nbroad. It includes several dimensions, including \r\nengaging in constructive and intensive political \r\ndialogue, creating a free and comprehensive trade zone, \r\npromoting intersectoral cooperation and taking stock \r\nof opportunities for collaboration within the Eastern \r\nPartnership. In economic terms, the Association \r\nAgreement is a big step forward for the economy of \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, as the European Union has \r\nbecome the country’s main trading partner. Several \r\npositive results have been achieved that facilitate trade \r\nin key sectors, including increasing the competitiveness \r\nof our goods and services, and opening up new \r\nopportunities for local producers. I am convinced that \r\nthe implementation of the Association Agreement is the \r\nbest and most viable option for ensuring prosperity and \r\nsustainable development for the Republic of Moldova \r\nand will warrant making the path to EU integration \r\nirreversible.\r\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming the \r\ncommitment of my country to continuously promoting \r\nrespect for Charter of the United Nations and to \r\ncontributing to the achievement of internationally \r\nagreed United Nations goals. I would also like to \r\nexpress the hope that the initiatives recently launched \r\nto strengthen the Organization’s capacities will \r\ncontribute to achieving improved performance in terms \r\nof development and international peace and security. \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n16/65 18-30110\r\nWe shall remain true to United Nations ideals and will \r\nwork to uphold the Organization’s capacity to ensure \r\nrespect for international law.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Pavel Filip, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Ms. Mia Amor Mottley, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for National Security and \r\nthe Civil Service, and Minister for Finance, \r\nEconomic Affairs and Investment of Barbados\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nNational Security and the Civil Service, and Minister \r\nfor Finance, Economic Affairs and Investment of \r\nBarbados.\r\nMs. Mia Amor Mottley, Prime Minister, Minister \r\nfor National Security and the Civil Service, and \r\nMinister for Finance, Economic Affairs and \r\nInvestment of Barbados, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Ms. Mia Amor Mottley, \r\nPrime Minister, Minister for National Security and \r\nthe Civil Service, and Minister for Finance, Economic \r\nAffairs and Investment of Barbados, and inviting her to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMs. Mottley (Barbados): Let me begin by \r\ncongratulating Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés \r\non her election to preside over the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-third session, and in particular for being \r\nthe fourth woman in the 73-year history of the United \r\nNations to receive the high honour of being elevated to \r\nthe position of President of the General Assembly.\r\nHowever, I would like to pause at this stage, \r\nbecause I came here with a speech that is impossible \r\nfor me to deliver given the events that have happened \r\nin the past 24 hours in the world in which we live and \r\nthat cannot be ignored. Those events include the transit \r\nof a tropical storm across my own country that we \r\nthought would have passed us by, only to have f loods \r\nhit many of our communities overnight, the onslaught \r\nof that same storm on our sister country, Saint Lucia, an \r\nearthquake off the shores of Martinique, Guadeloupe \r\nand Dominica this morning, which did not affect land \r\nbut destabilized those islands, an earthquake and \r\ntsunami off Indonesia earlier today, and a typhoon that \r\nis about to deal a blow to the people of Japan. Those \r\nevents are of great concern because the world in which \r\nwe live is a very different world from the one we have \r\nknown.\r\nI ask myself, what does all that matter? Last year \r\nthe Prime Minister of Dominica stood at this rostrum \r\nwithin days of the passage of a hurricane so violent \r\nthat to describe it as a category 5 hurricane would be \r\nto do injustice to what the people of Dominica were \r\nexposed to (see A/72/PV.19). The Assembly heard my \r\ncolleague the Prime Minister of Antigua speak earlier \r\nof the fact that over $140 billion in damage has come \r\nto the Caribbean region as a result of those weather \r\nsystems. I therefore ask the interpreters today to bear \r\nwith me, because it is impossible to deliver a speech \r\nthat is focused on anything else other than our reality \r\nin the Caribbean, our reality in the Pacific islands, our \r\nreality in the world in which we live.\r\nAs Heads of Government, we have asked the \r\ninternational community to address those issues, both \r\nin the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and as we \r\ncome to twenty-fourth session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, against the background of climate \r\nchange consisting of a warming of as much as 2°C. But \r\ntwo days ago, at the One Planet Summit, a graph was \r\nshown that has haunted me for the past 48 hours. That \r\ngraph spoke to the fate of the world with respect to the \r\ntipping points for a warming of 3° Celsius and under, \r\nfor 3° to 5°, and for over 5°. For a change of 3° Celsius \r\nand under, for which we are now on course because \r\nof our inability to take decisive action, the Arctic, the \r\nAntarctic and Greenland, as well as the coral islands \r\nand their people — the people of the region from which \r\nI come — are at terrible risk.\r\nFor us it is about saving lives; for others it is about \r\nsaving profits. We have reached the stage where we \r\nask the global community to recognize that what is at \r\nstake is simply not an academic debate. It is simply not \r\na question of the profits of multinational corporations. \r\nBut the evidence is clear and decisive that it is the lives \r\nand the livelihoods of our people that are at stake.\r\nI ask the Assembly, how can we just listen to \r\nspeech after speech after speech about the problem? \r\nHow many more speeches must we listen to before we \r\nrealize that agreements are necessary to fund the effort \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 17/65\r\nto address climate change, as well as agreements to \r\ncap our emissions. We cannot accept a change of 2°C, \r\nbecause a change of 2° means a rising sea level of 1.5 to \r\n2 metres for our islands. For islands like ours much of \r\nour economy is based on our coasts. The international \r\ncommunity must begin to understand what it will be \r\nlike for us by the end of the century. Matters pertaining \r\nto migration and security will become ever more \r\npressing in this world if we do not put a stop our \r\ngrowing emissions.\r\nI have therefore come here today not to talk about \r\na wide range of issues. There are those who would \r\nwish that I would speak on denuclearization, and our \r\nvoice will be heard on that issue, as the statement that \r\nI originally planned to deliver will be distributed. \r\nThere are those who would wish that we should \r\nalso speak on a matter that is gravely affecting our \r\ncommunity — chronic non-communicable diseases \r\n(NCDs) — and we shall speak on that continuously in \r\nother forums, because it is affecting one in every four \r\nof our citizens. There are those who would want me \r\nto speak also about the graduation of middle-income \r\ncountries to a status where we have lost access to \r\nfinance, which, ironically, affects our ability to adapt \r\nour environments, economies and societies to confront \r\nclimate change and its vagaries.\r\nBut when we make those arguments in forum after \r\nforum after forum, we are met with stern faces and a \r\ndetermination that our per capita income — as if that \r\nwere the real factor in how people eat and how people \r\nmove and how people sleep — should now preclude \r\nus from being able to have access to the very funding \r\nneeded to protect our people from the worst ravages of \r\nthe storms, earthquakes and fires that beset us. I ask \r\nthis global community to pause and reflect. As we \r\nlearned when we went to San Francisco two weeks ago \r\nfor the Global Climate Action Summit, time is truly \r\nrunning out on us.\r\nWe will make the decisions that we have to make \r\non a national level. We have committed to banning \r\nsingle-use plastics and styrofoam starting in April \r\n2019. We will try to become a fossil-fuel-free country \r\nby 2030. But what does that mean against the backdrop \r\nof a world that is not prepared to put the funding in \r\nplace to be able to stop the worst aspects of climate \r\nchange? What does that mean to people who have to \r\nrely on a Green Climate Fund because their per capita \r\nincome or their capacity to provide for their people is \r\nsimply not there? Is this a sterile environment, or is this \r\nan environment that recognizes that, mighty or small, \r\nwe in this world must protect each other?\r\nAs a small State we are accustomed to being \r\ntreated sometimes as if we did not exist. That is what \r\nhappened when de-risking from correspondent banking \r\nbecame the order of the day in the past few years, as \r\nif it were possible to cut a region off from access to \r\ntrade and expect it to be able to pay for goods and \r\nservices, despite the fact that its banks can no longer \r\nhave relationships with banks outside its borders. The \r\nonly time people were treated like that before was in \r\nthe previous century when we separated persons out of \r\nthe general population as lepers. But the countries that \r\ncome here to the United Nations as sovereign countries \r\nbegin to ask themselves, do we now live in a world \r\nwhere the mighty manoeuvre to make the majority \r\ninto minions? Or is this still a world that was promised \r\nto us in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \r\nupholding respect for the dignity of all?\r\nWe as small States need a corridor of stability. We \r\nsimply do not have the buffer to be able to withstand the \r\nshocks of international economic and financial crises. \r\nWe do not have the ability to withstand climate shock, or \r\nthe capacity to come to grips with the pervasive nature \r\nof chronic NCDs. Those are the things that destabilize \r\nus. But to that is added the removal of the insurance \r\npolicy of the United Nations — an Organization that \r\nmay not be well known or popular by name among \r\nour citizens, but an organization nevertheless without \r\nwhich we could not have made the gains that we \r\nhave made with respect to the reduction in childhood \r\nmortality, with respect to the billions of people being \r\nlifted out of abject poverty, or with respect to us being \r\nable as a world to create zones of peace, as we hope our \r\nCaribbean region will always be, not like in previous \r\ncenturies, when it became a theatre of battle.\r\nThe United Nations matters to us. It protects the \r\nsmall, it constrains the large and it gives us the ability \r\nto be able to plan for the future in that corridor of \r\nstability. When multilateralism is taken away from us, \r\nwhat are we left with and who is left to protect us? Who \r\nwill hear us, and on whose platform will we be able to \r\ncall not just upon the Governments of the world but also \r\non the people of the world? For what is clearly required \r\nnow is a behavioural change so that we can constrain \r\nthe madness that is taking place and restore global \r\ngovernance so as to counter the unilateral actions \r\nof many.\r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n18/65 18-30110\r\nWe ask ourselves, how do our citizens feel that \r\nwe must come here year after year and make the call \r\nyear after year as we do? From Barbados we come here \r\nand we speak about the embargo against the people of \r\nCuba — year after year — almost as if it were pro forma. \r\nBut it is not pro forma for the people in La Habana or \r\nSantiago. We speak about territorial disputes but we \r\nsee no major gains with respect to them. That may be \r\ntolerable for certain things, but it cannot be acceptable \r\nfor the issue of climate change. That is a matter of life \r\nand death for us.\r\nWe stand here conscious that, in many respects, \r\ntoday’s world looks like the world of 100 years \r\nago — the world that my grandparents inhabited, with \r\nits concentration of wealth, inequity and disposition \r\nto nationalism and xenophobia. And what did that \r\nlead to 100 years ago? It led to two world wars and an \r\natomic bomb. I repeat, it led to two world wars and an \r\natomic bomb. There are some who might say that it \r\nwas the occurrence of those wars that gave rise to the \r\nUnited Nations, because the circumstances at that time \r\nforced nations to agree when they might otherwise not \r\nhave agreed.\r\nI truly pray that this world does not need to see \r\ngreater calamity or greater loss of life to understand what \r\nis required of each and every one of us, as we stand in \r\ntrust on behalf of the people whom we represent and who \r\ndemand decisive action. We are not expected to achieve \r\nit all. The Talmud says that we are not even expected \r\nto complete the task, but we are not at liberty to resile \r\nfrom it. We in the Caribbean and in the Pacific need the \r\nworld to look again at a commitment to a change of no \r\nmore than 1.5° C, because 2° would be calamitous. We \r\nneed dedicated financing for development in accordance \r\nwith the Addis Ababa Action Plan, which speaks about \r\nsmall island developing States. We need the world to \r\nrecognize that the graph that showed the tipping points \r\nmust not serve to reinforce our greatest fear, namely, \r\nthat the world believes that we are dispensable. For that \r\nwas how we felt a century and more ago.\r\nI raise the question in the same way that I understand \r\nthat our principles must remain constant. Fifty-two \r\nyears ago, the first Prime Minister of Barbados stood \r\nat this rostrum and articulated a principle that binds \r\nus still today, namely, that we in Barbados shall, in \r\nthe conduct of our international relations, forever be \r\nfriends of all and satellites of none (see A/PV.1487). \r\nThat is absolutely still our principle, but the world in \r\nwhich we live is no longer the world that existed when \r\nhe delivered those comments. The baton has been \r\npassed from leader to leader, but it is time now for us in \r\nthis Hall and in my country to recognize that that baton \r\nmust be held firmly, because the storms, tsunamis, \r\nhurricanes, earthquakes and fires threaten to take the \r\nbaton from us. I pray that the United Nations recognizes \r\nthat the year 2020 is but 15 months away and that there \r\nwill be a point of no return.\r\nThis is not a science-fiction movie. This is not a \r\ncartoon. And if I ever thought that it was a fantasy, \r\nwhat transpired in the last 24 hours across the different \r\npoles of the world has reminded me that it is not. I leave \r\nhere to cut short my trip so that I can go home to my \r\ncountry. Some may say that, in spite of the f looding, we \r\nwere lucky that tropical storm Kirk did not do greater \r\ndamage. Two weeks ago in San Francisco, it was Isaac. \r\nI say simply that we cannot plan our affairs, or those \r\nof our people, on the basis of luck. It must be on the \r\nbasis of policy and decisive action, but above all else \r\non the basis of caring and empathy. I ask the world to \r\npause — pause — and let us get this one right, because \r\nit is not about Governments anymore. It is about people.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister \r\nfor National Security and the Civil Service, and \r\nMinister for Finance, Economic Affairs and Investment \r\nof Barbados for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Mia Amor Mottley, Prime Minister, Minister \r\nfor National Security and the Civil Service, and \r\nMinister for Finance, Economic Affairs and \r\nInvestment of Barbados, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ricky Nelson Houenipwela, \r\nPrime Minister of Solomon Islands\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Solomon \r\nIslands.\r\nMr. Ricky Nelson Houenipwela, Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Ricky Nelson \r\nHouenipwela, Prime Minister of Solomon Islands, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Houenipwela (Solomon Islands): At the outset, \r\nallow me, on behalf of my Government and the people \r\nof Solomon Islands, to convey our warmest greetings to \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 19/65\r\nthe President and the members of the General Assembly. \r\nWe offer our warmest congratulations to the President \r\non her election to preside over the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-third session. I am confident that she \r\nwill ably guide our deliberations during the current \r\nsession. I assure her of my delegation’s full support \r\nand cooperation during her tenure in office. I also \r\ncommend and thank her predecessor, His Excellency \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajcák, for his sterling stewardship of the \r\nprevious session, and we thank him for his leadership.\r\nSolomon Islands also joins other members in \r\nmourning the loss of the late Kofi Annan, former \r\nSecretary-General and a proud son of Ghana and \r\nAfrica. We acknowledge his immense contributions to \r\nthe work of our Organization. The late Kofi Annan was \r\ntruly a global statesman.\r\nI welcome the theme chosen for this session. It \r\nref lects the ultimate goal that this organ strives to \r\nachieve. “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies” is indeed \r\na powerful theme. It speaks of a united world, with both \r\nequal responsibilities and equal opportunities. It also \r\nspeaks of the need to be united in order to achieve peace \r\nand tranquillity among all our nations and peoples.\r\nThe implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) of Agenda 2030 requires a unified global \r\npartnership, and the achievement of those Goals requires \r\nthe concerted efforts of all stakeholders to mobilize \r\nall available resources. Agenda 2030 recognizes that \r\nby acting together we can conquer the inequities that \r\nhave befallen us today, be they man-made or natural. \r\nThe Goals also reflect the Preamble to the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, which speaks powerfully of our \r\nmission to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, \r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person and the \r\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large and \r\nsmall. The Preamble clearly articulates the principle of \r\nuniversality for all peoples and all nations regardless of \r\ntheir size.\r\nUnfortunately, the world has entered an era in \r\nwhich the foundation and strengths of multilateralism \r\nare being challenged and undermined by unilateral \r\nState posturing and manoeuvres. We have seen a \r\nproliferation of insularly focused policies on the part \r\nof some countries, causing them to renege on their \r\ncommitments under various international frameworks \r\nand treaties. The United Nations enables us to \r\nconsolidate our collective resolve and solidarity for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \r\npromote sustainable development, advance respect for \r\nhuman rights and promote the rule of law.\r\nSolomon Islands reaffirms its commitment to \r\nachieving the SDGs by 2030. To that end, we have \r\nincorporated the SDGs into our national development \r\nstrategy for the period 2016-2035. We also welcome the \r\nmidterm review of the small islands developing States \r\n(SIDS) Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway. \r\nIt is my hope that the outcomes of the review will \r\nprovide the impetus needed to reinvigorate the special \r\ncase for SIDS going forward. The review should also \r\nensure that all partners and stakeholders, together \r\nwith SIDS, more effectively address the challenges \r\nfaced by SIDS and take full advantage of opportunities \r\nthrough genuine and durable partnerships. Solomon \r\nIslands acknowledges that achieving the SDGs will \r\nbe an arduous and challenging task. However, it is a \r\npath that we must trek. We welcome all the assistance \r\nand support we have received from our development \r\npartners towards that cause.\r\nThis year Solomon Islands met two of the three \r\ncriteria for graduation from the status of a least \r\ndeveloped country (LDC) for the second consecutive \r\ntime. The Committee for Development Policy \r\nrecommended that Solomon Islands graduate from the \r\nlist of LDCs. The Economic and Social Council has \r\nalso recommended that this organ consider and endorse \r\nour graduation accordingly.\r\nWhile my Government appreciates the report \r\nand its recommendations, I must point out that, as a \r\npost-conflict State, Solomon Islands will require the \r\ndevelopment of appropriate prudent macroeconomic \r\nand financial policies in order to maintain the \r\nthreshold indicators upon which the recommendation \r\nfor graduation is premised. It is therefore my fervent \r\nhope that the Assembly will grant Solomon Islands an \r\nopportunity to properly assess the potential impacts \r\nof LDC graduation on the key sectors that sustain our \r\neconomy. A predictable and workable strategy that \r\nwould put us on a continued upward trajectory will need \r\nto be developed as well. I call on the United Nations \r\nsystem to support us in those assessments and in the \r\ndevelopment of appropriate strategies that could assist \r\nus to move forward boldly and with confidence.\r\nThe Solomon Islands Government respects the \r\nprocess of graduation, which is based on an agreed \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n20/65 18-30110\r\nrules-based system, and we will endeavour to graduate \r\nfrom the LDC status. However, any appropriate and \r\nrelevant assessment undertaken of the country must \r\nbe well-conceived, thorough and consultative. As \r\nMembers States are aware, the graduation of SIDS \r\nfrom LDC status will not improve the problem of our \r\nvulnerabilities. In that connection, we are pleased to \r\nknow that a special task force has been established to \r\nensure a smooth transition of SIDS from LDC status.\r\nWhile we in Solomon Islands are not subject to threats \r\nof an armed invasion, we are nevertheless continuously \r\nbeing invaded by a common enemy, one that the \r\ninternational community calls climate change. Climate \r\nchange is now the greatest threat facing humankind. \r\nFor us in the Pacific islands that threat is existential. \r\nThe resulting climate-change-related extreme weather \r\nevents mean that Solomon Islands — like other \r\nPacific island countries and, as we have just heard, \r\nthe Caribbean — is increasingly susceptible to natural \r\ndisasters of great severity. The threat of sea-level rise, \r\nas well as the inundation and salination of arable land \r\nand the destruction of biodiversity, partially caused by \r\na warming ocean and acidification, are elements that \r\ngive rise to food-security concerns, and increase the \r\nrisk of potential conflicts.\r\nIn the light of that threat, Solomon Islands calls \r\nfor collective global leadership on climate change \r\naction and strengthened commitment to achieving \r\npositive outcomes during the twenty-fourth session \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, which is to \r\nbe held in Katowice, Poland, this year. Solomon Islands \r\njoins other Pacific island States in strongly urging the \r\nlargest emitters of greenhouse gases to take urgent \r\nactions to reduce those harmful emissions: reduce \r\nnow, or regret later. In the ongoing dialogue on climate \r\nchallenge, appropriate financial support to SIDS to \r\naddress their losses and the damage resulting from the \r\ndestructive effects of climate change must be seriously \r\nconsidered.\r\nIn our efforts to reduce our reliance on fossil \r\nfuels and meet our intended nationally determined \r\ncontributions, Solomon Islands remains committed to \r\ntransitioning to the use of renewable energy. On behalf \r\nof my Government and the people of Solomon Islands, \r\nI extend our gratitude to our partners, including the \r\nWorld Bank, the Green Climate Fund, the Economic \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Fund of Korea, the \r\nAustralian Development Assistance Bureau and the \r\nAsian Development Bank, for their financial assistance \r\nand support for the Tina River hydrodevelopment \r\nproject. When completed, that project will provide \r\napproximately 80 per cent of the power needs of \r\nHoniara, our capital. I also acknowledge the bilateral \r\nassistance provided by the Governments of Italy, \r\nSpain, Austria and Luxembourg to the Pacific small \r\nisland developing States, including Solomon Islands, to \r\nsupport renewable energy projects. We look forward to \r\ncontinuing those partnerships in the coming years.\r\nAdequate and quality infrastructure is a prerequisite \r\nfor positive economic and inclusive growth. Investment \r\nin infrastructure projects positively impacts a majority \r\nof the population and enhances accessibility to goods \r\nand services, both private and public. In that connection, \r\nSolomon Islands is grateful to the Government and the \r\npeople of Japan for their assistance in implementing the \r\ntransformative development of major infrastructure, \r\nsuch as the Honiara city main roads, the Honiara seaport \r\nand the proposed upgrade of Honiara International \r\nAirport. The opening of the second international \r\nairport, in Munda, and the undersea fibre-optic cables \r\nare also game-changing infrastructures. The people \r\nand the Government of Solomon Islands are grateful \r\nfor that valuable assistance from Australia and New \r\nZealand.\r\nSolomon Islands has benefited from South-South \r\ncooperation on capacity-development programmes with \r\ncountries such as Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Cuba, \r\nincluding the potential to explore other innovative \r\nopportunities such as pharmaceutical solutions. The \r\npeople of Solomon Islands are forever grateful to all of \r\nour development partners for their genuine and durable \r\npartnerships. We will collaborate and increase efforts \r\ngoing forward.\r\nAs a large ocean State, the issue of the conservation \r\nand proper management of ocean resources is an \r\nimportant priority for Solomon Islands. We will \r\nactively engage on matters concerning the management \r\nof oceans. With regard to oceans management on \r\nthe high seas, my Government welcomes the recent \r\nfirst intergovernmental conference to negotiate an \r\ninternational legally binding instrument under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. A \r\nsuccessful outcome in the form of a fair and equitable \r\nframework will again prove the relevance of the \r\nOrganization and its convening powers.\r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 21/65\r\nAt the regional level, Solomon Islands subscribes \r\nto the Blue Pacific initiative, which sets the context \r\nfor the development of our regional priorities. We \r\nbelieve that maintaining the well-being of the oceans \r\nshould be a key priority, as acknowledged in SDG 14. \r\nThe restoration of fish stocks, the implementation of \r\nscience-based management measures and monitoring, \r\ncontrol and enforcement are but some of the measures \r\nthat Solomon Islands is promoting through domestic \r\nand regional arrangements.\r\nAt the national level, I am pleased to inform the \r\nAssembly that we are in the final stages of developing \r\nan ocean policy that will rationalize and enhance the \r\ncoordination and implementation of all ocean-related \r\nlegislation and policies. The development of the national \r\npolicy is a voluntary commitment that we announced at \r\nlast year’s Ocean Conference.\r\nSecurity concerns have become more complex. \r\nThey now involve activities beyond the traditional \r\ndefinitions. Some of them now include new threats \r\nsuch as climate change, cybercrimes and transnational \r\norganized crime, among others. It is therefore now \r\nmore important than ever that we work more closely \r\nand collectively with the international community to \r\naddress those security concerns and threats.\r\nThis year we witnessed constructive engagement \r\ntowards the better management of relations on the \r\nKorean peninsula. The United Nations must continue \r\nto ensure that conflict prevention and resolution remain \r\na central plank in its work, as mandated by the Charter \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nSolomon Islands recognizes that stability in the \r\nMiddle East is critical to world peace. A peaceful \r\nMiddle East will lead to a prosperous world. Solomon \r\nIslands also continues to call for the peaceful settlement \r\nof the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and supports a two-\r\nState solution.\r\nIn the Pacific, security concerns are driven by \r\nexternal factors, human security and climate-change \r\nchallenges. In recognizing the importance of our \r\nchanging security landscape, the Pacific Islands \r\nForum leaders undertook to build on the positive \r\nplatform established by the Biketawa Declaration. That \r\nculminated in our adoption, earlier this month, of the \r\nBoe Declaration at the recent Pacific Islands Forum \r\nsummit held in Nauru. As we continue to work towards \r\nthe goal of global peace, the need to actively engage in \r\npeacekeeping remains.\r\nAlthough small, Solomon Islands is contributing to \r\nthe achievement of global peace and security through \r\nits participation in the United Nations peacekeeping \r\nprogramme. So far, Solomon Islands has contributed \r\n12 officers to the United Nations Mission in South \r\nSudan. Solomon Islands is committed to increasing its \r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions. \r\nCognizant of the important role of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions, we call on Member States to \r\nwork collectively to ensure that the sustainability of \r\nUnited Nations programmes is not undermined by \r\nfunding shortfalls. Having benefited from the Regional \r\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, my country \r\nvalues the importance of peacekeeping missions.\r\nAdequate resources are required in order to sustain \r\npeace. I am sure that the international community also \r\nrecognizes that. In that connection, Solomon Islands \r\nhas benefited from the Peacebuilding Fund, approved \r\nby the Peacebuilding Commission in November 2017. \r\nThrough the resources provided under the Peacebuilding \r\nFund, we have been able to facilitate dialogue involving \r\na wide range of stakeholders on key issues, including \r\nland reform, rural development, border issues and the \r\nparticipation of youth and women.\r\nRecognizing the complex and ever-changing \r\nglobal-security landscape and realities, Solomon \r\nIslands reiterates the call for the reforms of the Security \r\nCouncil to be inclusive, by expanding the focus of the \r\nCouncil to non-traditional security priorities. Small \r\nisland developing States must have a voice through \r\na dedicated seat in the non-permanent membership \r\ncategory in the Council.\r\nThe biggest threat facing the Pacific islands, \r\napart from climate change, is the threat caused by \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs). Approximately \r\n70 to 80 per cent of all deaths in the Pacific can be \r\nattributed to NCDs, with many of those deaths being \r\npremature. In the Pacific, including in Solomon \r\nIslands, the high prevalence of NCDs translates into an \r\neconomic burden on health-care systems. Two thirds of \r\nthe beds in the National Referral Hospital in Honiara, \r\nour capital, are occupied by NCD patients. The burden \r\nthat NCDs poses on the productivity of the people of \r\nSolomon Islands and the opportunities forgone in order \r\nto provide care for NCD patients make that issue a key \r\nsocioeconomic concern for an economy with a small \r\nhuman-resource base. The international community \r\nhas already acknowledged, in the Samoa Pathway, the \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n22/65 18-30110\r\nchallenges posed by NCDs to small island developing \r\nStates. Now is the time for action.\r\nWhile we speak of leaving no one behind, we still \r\nclose our doors to Taiwan and continue to contradict \r\nour own principles by leaving Taiwan’s 23 million \r\npeople behind. The implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals requires a unified global partnership. \r\nTaiwan is ready, willing and able to engage in, and \r\ncontribute to, the wide range of substantive United \r\nNations programmes for the welfare of humankind. \r\nSolomon Islands continues to call for the participation \r\nof Taiwan in United Nations specialized bodies, \r\nincluding the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, the World Health Organization and \r\nthe International Civil Aviation Organization. Taiwan \r\nis the twenty-second-largest economy in the world and, \r\nas such, Taiwan should be part of global solutions in \r\nthe various international frameworks. I believe that \r\nTaiwan has a lot to contribute through its experience \r\nand technological capability. If we are to focus on \r\nshared responsibility and promote peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies, we should give Taiwan and its \r\n23 million people a chance. Despite the contributions \r\nmade by Taiwan to the well-being of the citizens of the \r\nglobe, we continue to ignore the right of Taiwan to self-\r\ndetermination. The time has come for the Assembly to \r\ngive due recognition to Taiwan as a legitimate member \r\nof the family of nations.\r\nIt is important that the administering Powers of \r\nnon-self-governing territories and all the relevant \r\norganizations honour their commitments made under \r\nthe Charter and the 1960 Declaration on the Granting \r\nof Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. \r\nTo that end and in accordance with the 1998 Nouméa \r\nAccord, Solomon Islands welcomes the free and fair \r\nreferendum to be held in New Caledonia on 4 November. \r\nSolomon Islands reaffirms that human rights principles \r\nare universal, indivisible and interrelated and must \r\nbe treated in a fair manner. All States have the moral \r\nduty and responsibility to uphold, respect and promote \r\nhuman rights and, where necessary, take preventive, \r\nprotective and punitive measures against human rights \r\nabuses and violations.\r\nSolomon Islands recognizes and respects Indonesia’s \r\nsovereignty over its territorial boundaries. My \r\nGovernment commits to working with the Government \r\nof Indonesia on areas of mutual interest, including \r\nhuman rights concerns in Papua and West Papua.\r\nSolomon Islands is committed to the principles of \r\ngood governance and transparency. We have passed \r\nan anti-corruption act, which aims to eliminate the \r\nscourge of corruption from all levels of our society. In \r\naddition, our Parliament has passed a whistle-blower \r\nprotection act, thereby giving due protection to those \r\nwho bring issues of corruption to the attention of the \r\nrelevant authorities. Solomon Islands is also committed \r\nto democratic principles and processes. We are equally \r\ncommitted to the holding of free and fair elections in \r\nearly 2019.\r\nSolomon Islands is an ardent believer in collective \r\naction. We are staunch supporters of multilateralism. \r\nAs such, we stand in solidarity with all members \r\nof the Assembly — the pinnacle of multilateralism. \r\nWithout the United Nations, we would not, as a small \r\nisland country, be able to be heard. Other louder \r\nvoices would drown us out. Our expectations from the \r\nOrganization remain high. As such, adequate resources \r\nfor programmes and projects that will have an impact \r\non citizens are needed. The United Nations has f laws, \r\nbut Solomon Islands continues to feel the impact of the \r\npower of working together on global issues that are \r\nchampioned by the United Nations. We believe that the \r\nprinciples and values upon which the United Nations \r\nwas founded remain relevant.\r\nMaking the United Nations relevant to all people \r\nis not just about standing up and talking about it in \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. It is incumbent upon us \r\nall to be seen as making the United Nations relevant \r\nto all peoples in the actions that we take individually \r\nand collectively.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ricky Nelson Houenipwela, Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, Prime \r\nMinister of Mongolia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Mongolia.\r\nMr. Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, Prime Minister of \r\nMongolia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 23/65\r\nPrime Minister of Mongolia, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Ukhnaa (Mongolia) (spoke in Mongolian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): At the outset, I \r\nwish to express my heartfelt congratulations to Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés on being elected President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. I \r\npledge my delegation’s full support and cooperation in \r\nthe discharge of her heavy responsibilities.\r\nToday we are living in a f lat, globalized and \r\ninterrelated world. Our life is digitalized to a great \r\nextent, and our way of life is greatly shaped by \r\ntechnological progress. In spite of such developments, \r\nwe encounter a plethora of global f lashpoints, including \r\nconflicts, poverty, hunger and inequality. I am therefore \r\nglad to represent my Government in this general debate, \r\nwhich will deliberate issues relating to making the \r\nUnited Nations more relevant to all people and making \r\nthe world more peaceful, equitable and sustainable.\r\nOver the past 73 years, the United Nations has \r\nreached out to and assisted every Member State as part \r\nof its diligent activities to promote peace, justice and \r\nglobal understanding. Accordingly, under the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, it is timely for the \r\nUnited Nations to endeavour, in line with its founding \r\nprinciples, to reach every individual in Member States. \r\nMongolia appreciates the leadership that Secretary-\r\nGeneral António Guterres has shown through his \r\nreform initiatives in reinforcing the joint efforts of \r\nMember States to leave no one behind. We support his \r\nreform initiatives in the peace and security architecture, \r\nwhich are aimed at ensuring stronger prevention \r\nand mediation activities and making peacekeeping \r\noperations more cost-effective, as well as his initiatives \r\naimed at repositioning the United Nations development \r\nsystem, which aspire to reform the United Nations so as \r\nto create a more effective, well-coordinated, transparent \r\nand accountable organization.\r\nAccording to a report by the Stockholm International \r\nPeace Research Institute, world military expenditures \r\nare estimated to have reached $1.7 trillion in 2017. That \r\nis not only an increase over the previous year, but also \r\nthe highest level of such expenditures since the end of \r\nthe Cold War. The arms race shows no sign of abating, \r\nand the situations in some regions are unstable owing \r\nto deteriorating conflicts. The use of technological \r\nadvancements in armed conflicts is making the \r\nworld situation more dangerous than ever. Mongolia \r\nhas always held the principled position that conflicts \r\nshould be resolved peacefully and through dialogue. \r\nBased on our peaceful philosophy, originating in our \r\nnational mentality and religious beliefs, we have always \r\nsupported peace and security initiatives proposed at the \r\nGeneral Assembly and other forums, and have striven \r\nto be a responsible member of the Organization.\r\nWith regard to Mongolia’s initiatives aimed at \r\ndemonstrating its contributions to peace and security \r\nat the global and regional levels, I need mention \r\nonly the resolutions on Disarmament Week, which \r\nhas been observed from 24 to 30 October every year \r\nsince 1978; the Declaration on the Right of Peoples to \r\nPeace, adopted in 1984; and my country’s declaration \r\nas a nuclear-weapon-free State in 1992, the status of \r\nwhich we continue to guarantee. Mongolians have \r\na saying that, “It is better to give a needle in time of \r\nneed rather than to give a camel when wealthy” — or, \r\nas it is said in English, “A friend in need is a friend \r\nindeed”. Mongolians always try to assist other nations \r\nand people when they are in need or seek peace and \r\nstability. On one such occasion, we brought hundreds \r\nof orphans from the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea to Mongolia following the Korean War and \r\nsubsequently raised them. During past decades, we \r\nhave stretched out our hands to the extent possible to \r\na number of countries that have faced natural disasters \r\nand terrorist acts, while rendering development \r\nassistance to countries of the region and sharing our \r\nmodest experience with democratic transition.\r\nThis year we are celebrating the seventieth \r\nanniversary of United Nations peacekeeping, which \r\nhas contributed immensely to world peace and security. \r\nMongolia first joined United Nations peacekeeping \r\nin 2002, with the deployment of unarmed military \r\nobservers, and began deploying troops in 2006. Today \r\nwe are proud of our troops, who have been praised \r\nby the international community for their robust, calm \r\nand appropriate approach to peacekeeping. As one of \r\nthe major 30 troop-contributing countries, as well as \r\none of the leaders in terms of troop deployment per \r\ncapita, Mongolia envisages increasing its participation \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping operations and \r\nfully supports the Secretary-General’s Action for \r\nPeacekeeping initiative.\r\nAddressing security issues in North-East Asia is \r\none of our foreign-policy priorities, as it has a direct \r\nimpact on our security and development. Mongolia has \r\nbeen closely following and has welcomed recent positive \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n24/65 18-30110\r\ndevelopments on the Korean peninsula, including the \r\ninter-Korean and other bilateral summits, which have \r\nprovided an important impetus to confidence-building \r\nand ensuring peace and security in North-East Asia. \r\nHowever, we are not merely observing the process, but \r\nare also trying to contribute to it. Since the 1980s, we \r\nhave been consistently pursuing the policy of launching \r\na dialogue mechanism in North-East Asia. Those efforts \r\nyielded the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian \r\nSecurity — an international conference that has been \r\nheld annually since 2014. The Dialogue is currently \r\ndeveloping into an open and inclusive mechanism \r\nthat brings together both Government officials and \r\nrepresentatives from academia from all of the countries \r\nin the subregion. Discussion topics cover a broad range \r\nof issues, including security, energy, infrastructure, \r\ngreen development and opportunities for humanitarian \r\ncooperation, among others.\r\nAsia is one of the most disaster-prone regions of \r\nthe world. We actively support regional cooperation for \r\nenhancing disaster resilience, reducing disaster risk \r\nand increasing the effectiveness of disaster-prevention \r\nactivities. Within that framework, we have proposed \r\nan initiative to establish the Northeast Asia Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction Platform in Mongolia. The proposal \r\nwas discussed at the conferences of the Ulaanbaatar \r\nDialogue on Northeast Asian Security and the second \r\nAsian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk \r\nReduction, successfully hosted in Ulaanbaatar in July, \r\nwhich received warm support from the countries of the \r\nregion with regard to its implementation. Mongolians \r\nbelieve that neighbours share the same disposition \r\nand interests. As Mongolia is determined to develop \r\nstrategic partnerships with its two big neighbours, it \r\nclosely follows their initiatives at the regional level \r\nand strives to engage with them in every possible way. \r\nWe recently proposed initiatives to facilitate travel for \r\nnationals of countries along the Belt and Road corridor \r\nand proposed the Peace, Prosperity, Progress, Promise \r\nAward for junior diplomats and scholars from Belt and \r\nRoad countries.\r\nUndoubtedly, many of the armed conflicts, \r\nrivalries, insurgencies and terrorist attacks that trouble \r\nus today have been caused by the clash of civilizations \r\nand religions. Mongolia is one of the few nations that \r\nhas had no religious or ethnic wars in its history. The \r\ngreat Mongolian Empire, established 812 years ago, \r\nwas governed by a written and codified law, and it was \r\na genuine home of religious freedom, where Christians, \r\nMuslims, Confucians and Buddhists were treated \r\nequally and lived together without any ideological \r\nstruggle. In brief, the legacy of religious tolerance \r\nand respect in the Mongolian Empire, which covered \r\nan immense swathe of territory, is very instructive for \r\ntoday’s world. More recently, during the era of the Cold \r\nWar in the twentieth century, we carried out specific \r\nactivities aimed at bringing together the voices of \r\ninternational Buddhists to support world peace through \r\nthe Asian Buddhist Conference for Peace (ABCP), \r\nwhich was established in 1969 and has achieved tangible \r\nresults in combating ideological divisions.\r\nWe perceive a pressing need today for effective \r\ndialogue mechanisms, such as the ABCP, which enjoys \r\nconsultative status in the Economic and Social Council. \r\nWe are therefore determined to revitalize its activities \r\nat the regional and international levels. In that regard, \r\nas a regional hub connecting North-East and Central \r\nAsian countries, we are announcing, from this rostrum, \r\nour initiative to host the Conference on Religious \r\nFreedom in Mongolia in March 2019. We are confident \r\nthat our initiative will contribute constructively to new \r\ndevelopments in the culture of peace and religious \r\ntolerance and freedom worldwide.\r\nMongolia was one of the early adopters of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the national \r\nlevel, with the adoption of its own Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Vision 2030 in February 2016. In \r\naccordance with its Vision, by 2030 Mongolia aspires \r\nto consolidate its democratic governance, preserve \r\necological balance, eradicate poverty in all its forms \r\nand rank among the upper-middle-income countries. \r\nMy Government has been taking important steps to \r\nensure coherence between the SDGs and the national \r\ndevelopment policies that have been implemented \r\npreviously and translate them into short- and medium-\r\nterm plans and programmes. In order to provide \r\nfinancing for development, an investment programme \r\nhas been adopted in line with the Government action \r\nplan. Moreover, SDG indicators were developed \r\nbased on multi-stakeholder consultations and will be \r\nadopted shortly.\r\nMongolia has witnessed an economic resurgence \r\nwith accelerated foreign-trade turnover, increased \r\ninvestment and a budget surplus over the past two years. \r\nHowever, Mongolian economic growth, which is highly \r\ndependent on mining and vulnerable to commodity \r\nprices, tends to be unstable and risky in terms of \r\nensuring the allocation of financial resources for the \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 25/65\r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nparticularly in years of commodity-price decline. \r\nMoreover, another challenge faced by my Government \r\ninvolves ensuring that every citizen benefits from \r\neconomic growth. For instance, following the recent \r\neconomic growth, unemployment, but not poverty, \r\ndecreased modestly. We are therefore introducing \r\nmeasures aimed at reducing income disparities and \r\npoverty into all relevant Government programmes \r\nand sectoral plans, while compiling a comprehensive \r\ndatabase of low-income households and supporting \r\npublic-private partnerships. In order to resolve issues \r\ncomprehensively, the national programme on reducing \r\npoverty and unemployment will be launched shortly.\r\nThis year we are celebrating the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights — a milestone document in the history of human \r\nrights. In accordance with the ideals enshrined in the \r\nDeclaration, Mongolia has made remarkable progress \r\nin the area of the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights. In recent years particular importance has been \r\nattached to the issues of enhancing gender equality, \r\nprotecting the rights of children, the elderly and persons \r\nwith disabilities, combating human trafficking and \r\ndrugs, and ensuring freedom of speech and expression. \r\nFor the period from 2016 to 2018, Mongolia has been \r\nserving as a member of the Human Rights Council for \r\nthe first time. It has been an honour for us to contribute \r\nto global endeavours to protect and promote human \r\nrights. Everyone is entitled to a social and international \r\norder in which the rights and freedoms set forth in \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be \r\nfully realized.\r\nFollowing the 2016 New York Declaration for \r\nRefugees and Migrants, Member States have continued \r\nworking constructively on the issue of migration. \r\nWe expect that the global compact for safe, orderly \r\nand regular migration will be adopted in Marrakesh, \r\nMorocco, in December on the historic day marking the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights and will serve as a valuable document \r\nin terms of ensuring the protection of the rights of all \r\nmigrants. The world has witnessed the highest level of \r\npopulation displacement ever over the past two decades. \r\nThat phenomenon has not spared my country, which \r\nhas a small population and is located in the highlands \r\nof North-East Asia.\r\nWe are experiencing a high volume of internal and \r\nexternal migration for a number of reasons, including \r\nunemployment and poverty. Owing to a large number \r\nof citizens who have been moving from the countryside \r\nto cities since the 1990s, as of 2017 45 per cent of our \r\ntotal population lives in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, \r\nwith a net annual growth of 22.3 per cent. The social \r\nramifications include poverty, unemployment, poor \r\naccess to health-care services and a high level of air \r\npollution in the capital city as compared with other \r\nareas. The citizens of Mongolia are highly educated. \r\nThe fact that the second-largest portion of the 2018 \r\nState budget has been allocated to the education sector \r\ndemonstrates the Government’s firm commitment to \r\nprioritize human-resource development. However, \r\naccess to schools and the quality of education has not \r\nalways kept pace with demographic growth, rates of \r\nurbanization and modern education standards. While the \r\npupil-to-classroom ratio in schools and kindergartens \r\nhas decreased together with the population density in \r\nrural areas, the opposite is true in urban centres. It was \r\ntroubling for me to hear at one of my public meetings \r\nin Ulaanbaatar last year that the 10-year-old child of a \r\ncitizen had to walk home at 9 p.m. through dark winter \r\nstreets, as the temperature dropped to between -20°C \r\nand -25°C on his way back home after the third shift of \r\nhis school, which does not provide bus service.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia is planning and \r\nimplementing policies and programmes that aim, by \r\n2030, to address effectively the challenges faced by \r\nliving in the capital, including kindergarten shortages, \r\nthe fact that approximately 30 suburban schools must \r\noperate in three shifts, the overloading of family \r\nhospitals and the adverse affects of air pollution on \r\npeople’s health, as well as the issue of unemployed \r\npeople in Ulaanbaatar, who account for one third of the \r\nnation’s unemployed. Furthermore, approximately 5 per \r\ncent of our total working-age population is working \r\nabroad, and that percentage is increasing. We therefore \r\nneed to take comprehensive measures to resolve issues \r\npertaining to their health care, social insurance and dual \r\ncitizenship, and improve the related legal environment.\r\nClimate change is yet another daunting challenge \r\nfor humankind today, along with peace, security and \r\ndevelopment issues. The Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange has been ratified by 179 countries. However, \r\nthe implementation rate is not living up to expectations, \r\nand the fulfilment of shared responsibilities by States \r\nMembers remains insufficient. We therefore welcome \r\nand support the Secretary-General’s timely initiative \r\nto convene the United Nations 2019 Climate Summit \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n26/65 18-30110\r\nfor reviewing the Paris Agreement commitments. \r\nGlobal warming and climate change impact all \r\nnations, and they are felt more intensely in the context \r\nof the economic and social development of the least-\r\ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries \r\nand small island developing States. In that regard, \r\nI would like to highlight that, through the initiative \r\nand leadership of Mongolia, the International Think \r\nTank for Landlocked Developing Countries has been \r\nestablished in Ulaanbaatar and became fully operational \r\nin May. The International Think Tank — the first-\r\never intergovernmental organization representing the \r\n32 landlocked developing countries — will carry out \r\npolicy research and implement feasible projects to \r\naddress common challenges and protect the interests \r\nand positions of those countries with the purpose of \r\naugmenting their ability to benefit from international \r\ntrade. I am confident that members will continue their \r\ncooperation and support for the activities of the Think \r\nTank, as they have done in the past.\r\nIn Mongolia, where extreme weather conditions \r\nprevail and the economy mostly relies on mining and \r\nagriculture, the scope, frequency and negative impact \r\nof disasters — such as earthquakes, desertification, \r\nsoil erosion and forest fires — have increased in recent \r\nyears. I would like to take this opportunity to inform \r\nthe Assembly that, during United Nations Climate \r\nWeek, my delegation will be screening a documentary \r\nentitled Blue Gold. We are sharing that documentary \r\nwith members not only to show the devastating impact \r\nof climate change in Mongolia, but also to sound the \r\nalarm about similar consequences elsewhere and appeal \r\nfor timely protective steps to be taken.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to call, from this United \r\nNations rostrum, for unity among all nations in a spirit \r\nof mutual trust and awareness of our responsibilities \r\nfor the sake not only of the current but also of future \r\ngenerations, as well as to strive for peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nMongolia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, Prime Minister of \r\nMongolia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Simon Coveney, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade \r\nwith responsibility for Brexit of Ireland.\r\nMr. Coveney (Ireland): The General Assembly is \r\nmeeting this week as we mark the 100th anniversary of \r\nthe birth of the late Nelson Mandela of South Africa and \r\nas we mourn the recent death of Kofi Annan, former \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations. They were two \r\ngreat leaders from Africa,whose personal commitment \r\nto the values and principles of multilateralism was \r\nunwavering — something that we should reflect upon \r\nand, I hope, draw inspiration from, particularly at a \r\ntime of global instability and of open challenges to the \r\nvery approach to the global decision-making process \r\nthat has been the foundation of this institution. Ireland \r\nwas honoured to have been asked to co-facilitate the \r\nconsultative process with Member States to produce \r\nthe political declaration adopted at the Mandela Peace \r\nSummit (resolution 73/1) on Monday. Nelson Mandela \r\nand Kofi Annan were revered and loved in my country. \r\nIn order to do justice to their legacy, we must renew \r\nour efforts to actively work for a culture of peace, \r\ntolerance and respect for human dignity globally. Is \r\nthat not fundamentally what the United Nations should \r\nbe about today? Can we not challenge ourselves to \r\nuse the Peace Summit and this week at the General \r\nAssembly to strive, with the courage and humility that \r\nMandela and Annan showed, for the type of world that \r\nthey envisioned and fought for? In truth, we must do \r\nmuch better than we are currently doing to live up to the \r\naspirations that they represented.\r\nGeographically, Ireland is a small island on the \r\nwestern edge of Europe, but in Ireland we see ourselves \r\nas an island at the centre of the world, with a global \r\ndiaspora more than 10 times the size of our population at \r\nhome. We have learned that, in an interdependent world, \r\nthe challenges of our time do not respect geographic \r\nboundaries. Finding solutions is surely now a shared \r\nresponsibility and — whether a small Polynesian island \r\nor a super-Power — we all breathe the same air. That \r\nsense of shared responsibility guides Ireland’s view of \r\nthe world and the part that we are trying to play in it. \r\nAlmost a century ago, Ireland became an independent \r\nState, thereby escaping a history of colonialism. Ours is \r\nhardly a unique story, but it is one that I hope allows us \r\nin Ireland to empathize with so many of the countries \r\nrepresented in this Hall. Like the United Nations \r\nitself, we were born out of conflict. It has shaped how \r\nwe view the world and our current responsibilities as \r\nglobal citizens. Our membership in the United Nations \r\nhas played, and continues to play, a major part in our \r\ndevelopment. We not only support a fair, rules-based \r\norder in international affairs, but we exist, survive and \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 27/65\r\nprosper because of it. We see no viable alternative to \r\nthat approach.\r\nIn peacekeeping, disarmament, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, climate-change issues, nutrition, human \r\nrights and humanitarian assistance, we have striven \r\nto match our words with actions, along with increased \r\nfunding and support for multilateral structures. \r\nWhile the system has its f laws and always requires \r\nimprovement and modernization, Ireland is convinced \r\nthat there is no other way to meaningfully address \r\nthe common opportunities and threats that face us \r\nall. For Ireland — and, I suggest, for many smaller \r\nMember States as well — multilateralism strengthens \r\nour independence, self-confidence and security, rather \r\nthan diminishes it. If one believes, like Ireland, in \r\nmultilateralism, now is the time to fight for it across \r\nthe United Nations system, including, if necessary, \r\nstanding in opposition to powerful countries that \r\nhave traditionally played great leadership roles \r\nwithin this institution. We certainly cannot — and I \r\nwill never — defend a logic that views multinational \r\nengagement as an abdication of national leadership or \r\nas a loss of influence on the international stage. We \r\nurgently need global leadership that galvanizes global \r\nsupport through strength of argument, as opposed to \r\neconomic or military strength, and that leads to finding \r\nsolutions to our collective problems so as to raise \r\nliving standards for everybody, in particular for those \r\nfurthest behind. We must start believing in a world \r\nwhere solidarity is just as, if not more, important as \r\nsovereignty — a world where we live in each other’s \r\nshelter and not shadow.\r\nWe need — and I believe that we must demand \r\nduring weeks like this one — positive outward-\r\nlooking leadership by the great Powers of the United \r\nNations, particularly Powers that traditionally have \r\nbeen indispensable, if imperfect, forces for good \r\nacross the world. Without that, in truth, I fear for the \r\nfuture of global stability, and I fear for the future of \r\nthe United Nations in the work that it must do — work \r\nthat can never be replicated or replaced by transactional \r\nbilateral engagement where the powerful dominate \r\ndecision-making, and decisions are no longer based on \r\nthe strength of argument, compassion or generosity, \r\nbut are instead based on States being forced to choose \r\nsides, fearful, perhaps, of being offside with the strong \r\nand powerful, or, in some cases, singled out for special \r\ntreatment if they do not provide their support. Ireland \r\ndoes not wish to see any diminution in the role played \r\nby the United Nations leading actors and funders. At \r\nthe same time, we will always demand a place on the \r\nstage for everyone and an atmosphere that encourages \r\nfree speech and new, if sometimes controversial, \r\nthinking. The United Nations foundations will crumble \r\nwithout the inclusivity and generosity of thinking \r\nembedded through decades of experience. Sometimes \r\nit is the smallest States that have the answers to the \r\nbiggest problems.\r\nToday we cannot be complacent about the \r\ninstitutional reforms needed to maximize the United \r\nNations legitimacy and relevance in a rapidly changing \r\nworld. Ireland salutes the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and welcomes the steps taken by the General \r\nAssembly on reform, but the implementation of \r\nthose reforms will be our real test of success. Ireland \r\nparticularly wants to see the successful reform of the \r\nUnited Nations development system aimed at better \r\nsupporting the implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. That is why my Government earlier \r\nthis month pledged more than $1 million in support of \r\nthe reform of the United Nations development system \r\nas a complement to the strong financial support that \r\nIreland has an obligation to continue to provide to \r\nUnited Nations funds, programmes and agencies.\r\nHowever, reforms at the United Nations must go \r\nbeyond the managerial and structural level. The United \r\nNations political bodies must also catch up to where \r\nthe rest of the world is right now. That is particularly \r\nthe case regarding the Security Council. Ireland is clear \r\non the need to increase the size of the Council. Many \r\nareas of the world are either insufficiently represented \r\nin the Council or, in some cases, not represented at all. \r\nThe historically unjust underrepresentation of Africa in \r\nparticular needs to be addressed so that there can be an \r\nequitable African voice in Council decisions affecting \r\ntheir own continent, where much of the United Nations \r\nfocus will be needed in the decades ahead. We know that. \r\nWe also want to see the consideration of a designated \r\nrole for small island developing States. The growing \r\nimpact of climate change, which many speakers before \r\nme have mentioned, on international peace and security \r\nconcerns adds weight to that call.\r\nIt is not only the composition of the Security \r\nCouncil, however, that needs to come under scrutiny. \r\nThe use or threat of use of the veto remains a serious \r\nobstacle to the work of the Council, but also to that of \r\nthe United Nations as a whole. Far too often the use of \r\nthe veto has resulted in the shocking abandonment of \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n28/65 18-30110\r\nsome of the most vulnerable people on our planet. The \r\nfailure of the Security Council to take action to prevent \r\nmass-atrocity crimes betrays victims and undermines \r\nthe United Nations credibility. History will not judge us \r\nkindly on that issue. I strongly believe that the political \r\nreform of the Council would inevitably lead to a greater \r\nsense of participation, responsibility and ownership \r\namong the United Nations membership, as a whole. \r\nThat would surely only be positive for the functioning \r\nof the United Nations more broadly. Many say that \r\npeople like me and others are wasting our time calling \r\nfor the reform of the Security Council and that the great \r\nPowers will never allow it. That may be so, but if the \r\npower of evidence and argument is to mean anything in \r\nthe Council Chamber, Ireland will keep trying to build \r\na coalition for change.\r\nWhile recognizing the need for new structures, we \r\nalso need to make the best use of existing structures and, \r\nof course, always look to improve them. International \r\ncriminal justice, where there has been an irreversible \r\nand, I hope, significant shift towards accountability, is \r\none such example. It is particularly pertinent to recall \r\nthat fact on the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of \r\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.\r\nJustice and accountability always provide a better \r\nalternative to revenge, impunity or amnesty. We have \r\nseen important developments in the area of gender-\r\nbased and sexual violence by enabling the prosecution \r\nof sexual violence as a war crime, a crime against \r\nhumanity and genocide. I am glad to say that we \r\nhave witnessed universal justice strengthened beyond \r\npower politics and geopolitical interests. I am pleased \r\nto report that earlier this month, Ireland ratified the \r\nAmendments to the Rome Statue of the International \r\nCriminal Court on the crime of aggression, which were \r\nagreed in Kampala. Yesterday I lodged our instrument \r\nof ratification with the Secretary-General.\r\nIreland welcomes the level of ambition at the heart \r\nof the Secretary-General’s new disarmament agenda. \r\nWe hope that it will serve as a turning point in the \r\ncurrent challenges facing the disarmament and arms-\r\ncontrol processes.\r\nIreland is proud of the historic role that it played in \r\nthe development of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in the past century. The \r\nNPT demonstrates what States can achieve together in \r\nthe spirit of peace and cooperation. However, we also \r\nhave a responsibility to remain ambitious in the pursuit \r\nof the total elimination of nuclear weapons. I hope that \r\nour efforts to promote the adoption of the Treaty on \r\nthe Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons will continue to \r\nreflect that.\r\nIreland, like many in this Hall, is deeply concerned \r\nby the persistent use of explosive weapons in populated \r\nareas in armed conflicts around the globe. Civilian \r\npopulations continue to bear the brunt of armed \r\nconflicts. We must redouble our efforts to fulfil the \r\nSecretary-General’s call to address that challenge in \r\na more comprehensive way than we have to date. We \r\ncontinue to call on the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea to abide by its obligations under the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and its international \r\ncommitments and to abandon all nuclear and other \r\nweapons of mass destruction and ballistic-missile \r\nprogrammes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible \r\nmanner. We welcome the progress towards that end.\r\nIreland’s multilateralism runs deep through our \r\ncommitment to United Nations peacekeeping. Our \r\ncontribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nenjoys a special place in the hearts of the Irish people. \r\nThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of Ireland’s \r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions. \r\nTens of thousands of Irish women and men have \r\nworn blue helmets or blue berets in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations over six decades, particularly \r\non missions in Africa and the Middle East. Our Prime \r\nMinister stated here at United Nations Headquarters \r\nin July that we are as proud of the blue helmet as we \r\nare of the harp or the shamrock — symbols of Ireland. \r\nToday there are more than 500 Irish defence force \r\npersonnel — men and, increasingly, women, I am glad \r\nto say — deployed across the Middle East and Africa in \r\nsix United Nations missions.\r\nThe humanitarian and development work of the \r\nUnited Nations is central to Ireland’s commitment to \r\nthe Organization. However, we know that we have \r\nan obligation to do more. We have reaffirmed our \r\ncommitment to achieving the United Nations target \r\nof providing 0.7 per cent of gross national income \r\nfor official development assistance by 2030 — the \r\nsame year that the world has pledged to deliver the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. But in real terms \r\nwhat that means is that Ireland would have to increase \r\nits contribution to development from approximately \r\n€750 million a year to more than €2.5 billion a year over \r\nthe next 10 to 12 years. We are ambitious for Ireland’s \r\ninternational development cooperation, but we also \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 29/65\r\nneed to be authentic to our own experiences as we seek \r\nto maximize our contribution.\r\nMy country has known hunger and famine. We \r\nhave known poverty. But we have also experienced \r\ntransformation — a transformation based on education, \r\ninnovation and a vibrant civic society. Of course, our \r\nvalues are not Ireland’s alone. They are at the core of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the \r\nfuture that most people in this Hall seek. We know that, \r\nin order to create a peaceful, fair and just world, we \r\nmust respect the human rights of everyone. Economic \r\nprogress cannot be delivered at the cost of equality for \r\nall and of protecting the most vulnerable in our societies. \r\nWe must also go beyond rhetoric in our efforts to \r\nempower women and girls. Gender equality cannot be \r\nseen as a gift to be granted but rather as a fundamental \r\ndriver that can underpin real improvements in the lives \r\nof so many people.\r\nThe need for collective action to address climate \r\nchange has been a common theme this week and is \r\nmore evident by the month. As an island State, we \r\nlearned centuries ago that the waters surrounding our \r\nisland cannot deter forces beyond our control. Isolation \r\ncertainly does not mean safety. Since I spoke here \r\nlast year (see A/72/PV.20), Ireland has experienced \r\nits first hurricane, generated in the eastern Atlantic, \r\nits most severe winter cold snap and, this summer, \r\nthe most sustained drought in living memory. The \r\ndenial of climate change needs to end, and collective \r\naction on climate adaptation, as well as mitigation, \r\nneeds to intensify. Today many more island nations \r\nface challenges not of their own making as a result of \r\nclimate change, pollution and rising sea levels. We must \r\nwork together to overcome those challenges as nations \r\nunited in our determination to protect ourselves and the \r\nway in which we live.\r\nMore broadly, the scale of the humanitarian \r\ncrises facing the international community cannot \r\nbe overstated. More than 134 million people around \r\nthe world are in need of humanitarian assistance and \r\nprotection, with conflict being the single greatest \r\ndriver of that need. As a country committed to the \r\nhumanitarian principles, we will continue to contribute \r\nto international efforts to ease the plight of civilians \r\nsuffering the impact of conflicts in places such as \r\nSouth Sudan, the Central African Republic, Syria, \r\nYemen, Palestine and, unfortunately, many other parts \r\nof the world.\r\nToday there are over 68 million people worldwide \r\nwho have been forcibly displaced from their homes, \r\nwith more than 25 million cross-border refugees. I \r\nam very conscious that a huge majority of displaced \r\npeople are being sheltered in countries that are already \r\nexperiencing high levels of vulnerability and poverty \r\nand that their generosity places a huge strain on already \r\nvery limited resources. Ireland will continue to support \r\nrefugees and vulnerable host communities. However, \r\nI want to particularly acknowledge the generosity of \r\nmany States and the extraordinary burden that they bear \r\ntoday — States such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Egypt, \r\nJordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Pakistan, Turkey, Uganda and \r\nmany more. Those countries host enormous numbers of \r\npeople displaced by conflicts in neighbouring regions. \r\nWe need to do more to help them.\r\nBangladesh is now host to the world’s largest \r\nrefugee camp, sheltering over 1 million refugees. In \r\nthe year since I last addressed the General Assembly \r\nthat camp has swelled with hundreds of thousands \r\nof Rohingya refugees f leeing appalling violence in \r\ntheir neighbouring home state. The Rohingya must be \r\nassured of a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable \r\nreturn, and the international community must insist on \r\nan end to impunity for the appalling acts of violence \r\nthat have come to light, as well as ensure accountability \r\nfor the crimes that have been committed.\r\nBecause of Ireland’s experience of prolonged, \r\nintractable conflict, but one that ended in a successful \r\npeace settlement, the Israel-Palestine conflict and \r\nthe lack of progress on a peace agreement have been \r\na big foreign policy priority for me and for the Irish \r\nGovernment for many years. Ireland’s own experience \r\nshows that even decades-long conflicts do have a \r\nturning point. Sometimes that turning point comes \r\nunexpectedly, and sometimes it happens quickly.\r\nPeace is a process; it is not a moment. To bear fruit, \r\nthat process requires untiring work and commitment. \r\nWe all surely realize by now that forced outcomes with \r\nwinners and losers can never be a basis for lasting \r\npeace. From all my visits to the Middle East, I know \r\nthat the current situation serves the interests of neither \r\npeople, but I am also conscious that the burden of being \r\nunder occupation is the heavier one.\r\nSettlement construction exacerbates that fact and is \r\ncausing ever-greater damage to the prospects for peace. \r\nIreland, like many, is very conscious of the threat to \r\nthe small Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar and other \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n30/65 18-30110\r\nstrategically located West Bank villages. Let me say this \r\nvery clearly: what happens there will tell us much about \r\nwhether we can count on a real commitment on the part \r\nof those involved to negotiating a two-State solution.\r\nThe situation in Gaza is also simply untenable, and \r\nthe 1.9 million people living there desperately need the \r\ndecade-long blockade to end so that they can start to \r\nrebuild normal lives and so that teenagers will reject \r\nthe twisted promises of radicals and look to the future \r\nwith some hope. They also need for the countries that \r\nfund terrorist activities, chaos and mismanagement in \r\nGaza to halt their unwelcome interference without any \r\nfurther delay.\r\nWhen I visited Gaza I was struck by how much \r\npeople there rely on the efforts of the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East (UNRWA) — both to meet basic needs such \r\nas education and health care, but also to know that they \r\nare not forgotten. They are not forgotten by countries \r\naround the world. I am proud that Ireland is such a long-\r\nstanding supporter of UNRWA, not just in Gaza but \r\nin the West Bank and across the region in Jordan and \r\nLebanon too. Ireland will continue that assistance and \r\nhas increased its contribution to €7 million for this year. \r\nI hope that before the end of the year we will have added \r\neven more to that, recognizing the financial pressures.\r\nI greatly regret the recent cuts to UNRWA funding \r\nannounced by the United States, and I plead with those \r\nin power in that country to reconsider the consequences \r\nof their decisions in that regard. Reform of UNRWA \r\nmay be needed, but surely it should happen in the \r\ncontext of a peace deal and a functioning Palestinian \r\nState in the future. Shutting off funding now is simply \r\nadding to the turmoil of current pressures and hardship, \r\nwhere UNRWA cuts are interpreted — certainly locally, \r\non the ground — as collective punishment targeting \r\nwomen and children as well as men.\r\nIs it so hard to understand that increasing the \r\nmisery of Palestinians only empowers the radicals, \r\nwho want to poison the minds of hopeless, angry, young \r\nPalestinians and destabilize the moderate political \r\nleadership who are committed to a lasting peace? A \r\npeople who have been downtrodden for decades will \r\nnot be forced or pressurized into negotiating through \r\nenforced hardship or humiliation — the human soul \r\nsimply does not work that way. How many examples of \r\nthat do we need in order to learn that lesson? Without \r\nhope or dignity, minds close to the compromises that \r\nwe all know are necessary for a final settlement and \r\nfor peace.\r\nI believe there is a way forward in the Middle East \r\nwith American leadership, but also with the support \r\nand involvement of other countries that can help to \r\nbroker a peace deal between an Israel that justifiably \r\ndemands security in any future deal and a Palestinian \r\npeople who dream of their own country and State. I \r\nknow that Ireland is a small player in all of that, but \r\nwe will continue to advocate honestly for progress and \r\njustice as a friend of both Israel and Palestine.\r\nMember States know that Ireland is a proud and \r\nambitious candidate for a seat on the Security Council \r\nat the elections that will be held in June 2020. We have \r\nbeen making our case better known with States over the \r\npast months. My apologies if we have been overdoing \r\nit. We Irish are by nature bridge-builders and talkers, \r\nbut we listen too — to all sides — and work to build \r\ncollective solutions to our global challenges. We are \r\ncommitted to hearing and heeding the voices of all \r\nStates to forge consensus and common purpose. We \r\nthink independently. Our path is very much our own, \r\nand we bring no partisan agenda to the table. We are \r\nhere to serve the wider good and to support the United \r\nNations. We will always fight for a multilateral system \r\nthat works for all, particularly the small and the weak. \r\nWe will be courageous when the United Nations and \r\nall of its Members need courage and leadership from \r\nthe Security Council. Empathy, partnership and \r\nindependence will guide us.\r\nIreland is a small country with a broad mind, \r\na listening ear and a strong independent voice that \r\npromotes the values that I hope we all share and that \r\ncan take this institution forward with confidence and \r\nfairness in the future.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Adel Ahmed Al-Jubeir, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\r\nMr. Al-Jubeir (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAt the outset, it is my pleasure to congratulate Her \r\nExcellency María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-third session. I wish her every success in \r\nher tasks. I also wish to congratulate her predecessor, \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák, President during the previous \r\nsession, for his efforts. It would be remiss of me not to \r\ncommend as well the tireless efforts undertaken by His \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 31/65\r\nExcellency Mr. António Guterres, Secretary-General \r\nof the United Nations,\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is founded on a great \r\nlegacy of principles and constant elements that underpin \r\nits foreign policy, at the top of which is its permanent \r\nambition to achieve peaceful solutions to conflicts, while \r\npreventing their escalation by undertaking mediation \r\nefforts in order to achieve that noble objective. Perhaps \r\nthe best illustration of the responsible political role \r\nplayed by my country in the promotion of international \r\npeace and security is the peace agreement concluded \r\nrecently in the city of Jeddah between Ethiopia and \r\nEritrea, under the auspices of the Custodian of the Two \r\nHoly Mosques, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud. \r\nThe agreement brought to an end the longest-lasting \r\nconflict on the African continent. Another illustration \r\nis the historic meeting held under the auspices of my \r\ncountry between the leaders of Eritrea and Djibouti \r\nafter they had shunned all contacts with each other for \r\n10 years.\r\nThe Palestinian question has been pivotal for my \r\ncountry and the Islamic world. It is our conviction \r\nthat the Palestinian people have the right to build an \r\nindependent Palestinian State within the 1967 borders \r\nand with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance \r\nwith international resolutions and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative. We reiterate our call to redouble sincere \r\nefforts aimed at ending that conflict, which has lasted \r\nlonger than any other in the region.\r\nThe Houthi terrorist militias of Iran continue to \r\nlaunch ballistic missiles manufactured and supplied by \r\nIran towards Saudi cities — there have been 199 such \r\nmissiles to date. Their activities seek to destabilize the \r\nsafety and security of navigation in the Bab Al-Mandab \r\nregion and the Red Sea. My country reiterates our \r\ncommitment to the need for a political settlement to the \r\nsituation in Yemen based on three terms of reference, \r\nnamely, the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative, the \r\noutcomes of the Yemeni National Dialogue Conference \r\nand Security Council resolution 2216 (2015).\r\nWe will continue to provide and facilitate all \r\nhumanitarian efforts to alleviate the disastrous situation \r\nfacing the brotherly Yemeni people. We also seek to \r\nfully support the Yemeni economy, including through \r\nthe recent deposit of $2 billion in the Central Bank \r\nof Yemen, which was ordered by His Majesty King \r\nSalman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, Custodian of the Two \r\nHoly Mosques. The humanitarian support provided by \r\nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Yemen over the past \r\nfour years amounts to more than $13 billion.\r\nTerrorism and extremism are two of the major \r\nchallenges faced by the whole world. Our region has \r\nnot been spared from the scourge of terrorist groups. \r\nIn that context, we reiterate our call for greater \r\ninternational cooperation to end terrorism in all its \r\nforms, cut off its funding sources and punish those who \r\nsupport terrorists or facilitate their activities in any \r\nway. The efforts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to that \r\nend are clear to everyone. My country has established \r\ninstitutions to fight extremism and terrorism, namely, \r\nthe Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology, \r\nthe Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, \r\nmade up of more than 40 States, and the International \r\nCentre for Counter-Terrorism, to which my country has \r\ncontributed $110 million.\r\nIran continues its terrorist activities and aggressive \r\nbehaviour. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expresses \r\nits support for the new United States strategy for \r\ndealing with Iran, which includes seriously addressing \r\nits nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes and its \r\nsupport for terrorism. Our country believes that, in \r\norder to achieve peace and stability in the Middle \r\nEast, it is necessary to deter Iran from exercising its \r\nexpansionist and subversive policies. Iran has formed \r\narmed terrorist militias and provided them with ballistic \r\nmissiles. It has conducted assassinations targeting \r\ndiplomats and committed acts of aggression against \r\ndiplomatic missions. In addition, Iran has stirred up \r\nsectarian strife and interfered in the affairs of countries \r\nin the region. Such aggressive behaviour constitutes \r\na glaring violation of all international covenants and \r\ntreaties, as well as Security Council resolutions. That is \r\nwhy Iran is under international sanctions.\r\nMr. Arrocha Ruíz (Panama), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nAs part of our resolute and continuous efforts to \r\ncounter terrorism, my country, along with the United \r\nArab Emirates, the Kingdom of Bahrain and the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, has broken off all contacts with \r\nthe State of Qatar, a State that continues to support \r\nterrorism, sponsor extremists and spread hateful \r\nrhetoric through its media, while failing to uphold its \r\nobligations under the Riyadh Agreement of 2013 and \r\nRiyadh Supplementary Agreement of 2014, which is \r\nunacceptable. Qatar has persisted in its practices, which \r\nhas left us with no choice but to boycott it.\r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n32/65 18-30110\r\nIn the eighth year of the Syrian crisis, the \r\nhumanitarian situation requires all of us to shoulder our \r\nresponsibilities. My country, from the very first day of \r\nthe outbreak of the crisis, has sought to care for the \r\nSyrian people to help them realize their ambitions to live \r\nin safety on their own soil. In that regard, we reiterate \r\nthe need to implement Security Council resolution \r\n2254 (2015) and reach a political solution in line with \r\nthe principles of the Geneva communiqué (A/66/865, \r\nannex). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has worked to \r\nunite the Syrian opposition groups so that they can \r\nnegotiate with the regime and ensure Syria’s security, \r\nstability and unity and prevent foreign intervention or \r\nany attempt to partition the country.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia supports legitimacy \r\nin Libya. We recall the importance of upholding the \r\nSkhirat Agreement to resolve the Libyan crisis, and \r\ncall for maintaining the unity and territorial integrity \r\nof Libya. We underscore our support for the United \r\nNations efforts and the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ghassan Salamé.\r\nMy country is among the leading donors of \r\nhumanitarian and development assistance. The \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia has contributed 3.7 per cent \r\nof the Saudi gross domestic product, thereby surpassing \r\nthe percentage called for by the United Nations, namely, \r\n0.7 per cent of gross domestic product.\r\nThe international order that has existed for \r\ncenturies is based on the principle of respect for national \r\nsovereignty and non-interference in the domestic \r\naffairs of other countries. Commitment to international \r\nnorms and laws is of the utmost importance and is not \r\nup for discussion. Sovereignty is a red line that cannot \r\nbe crossed. My country rejects any intervention in its \r\ndomestic affairs and any form of dictate by any country.\r\nThe Government of my country, with the firm \r\nsupport of His Majesty King Salman Bin Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Saud, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, \r\nand Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Saud, has placed its people at the core of \r\ndevelopment. Based on the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, my \r\ncountry has opened doors for its citizens so that they \r\ncan move towards the future, and has empowered young \r\npeople and sought to benefit from their creative spirit. \r\nIn addition, it has been employing modern technologies \r\nto serve development and make our country a leading \r\nenvironment for investment.\r\nWomen in my country have an active presence at \r\nall levels. Empowering women is a governmental goal \r\nso that they can have a full opportunity to contribute \r\nto development.\r\nThe vocation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is \r\nbased on genuine partnership with the world, leading \r\nto a prosperous present and a bright future. That would \r\nenable the next generations to live in security, stability \r\nand peace. We wish our Organization further success in \r\nachieving its lofty objectives.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Péter Szijjártó, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Trade of Hungary.\r\nMr. Szijjártó (Hungary): History usually \r\ndefines certain periods by the major developments \r\nand phenomena that occur during that period. If you \r\npose the question as to which development or which \r\nphenomenon history will select to identify the current \r\nperiod that we have been living in, then the answer is \r\npretty obvious. The huge migratory waves that we are \r\nexperiencing globally are how history will identify \r\nour current era. Those huge migratory waves impose \r\na significant security risk almost everywhere in the \r\nworld. They have destabilized a number of countries \r\nover the past years. They have caused serious political \r\ndebates globally. They bring with them the threat of \r\nterror and its consequences, which are more serious \r\nthan ever — even in those parts of the world that have \r\nnot experienced that phenomenon before. Migratory \r\nwaves are not beneficial for anyone, certainly neither \r\nfor those who must risk their lives to get to another \r\nplace in the world nor for those countries that end up \r\nhaving to host a large number of people coming from \r\ndifferent cultures. Those huge migratory waves lead \r\nonly to the creation of parallel societies, with very \r\nserious security implications.\r\nI come from a Central European country whose \r\nterritory saw 400,000 illegal migrants march through \r\nit in 2015. Those migrants violated our borders. They \r\nshowed disrespect for our regulations, our culture \r\nand our way of life. The migrants attacked the police. \r\nThey rejected any kind of cooperation with the local \r\nauthorities. They occupied public areas. And they \r\nthreatened people and families.\r\nWe Hungarians have first-hand experience with \r\nillegal migration — we did not just see it on television \r\nor hear it from storytellers. We have first-hand, direct \r\nexperience. Based on that, I can tell members that it is \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 33/65\r\nno wonder that there are big debates going on globally \r\nas to how to handle that phenomenon. Unfortunately, \r\nI have to tell the Assembly that the European Union \r\n(EU) has failed to find an answer to that challenge. \r\nThe European Union gave a very poor answer: instead \r\nof concentrating on how to stop migratory f lows, the \r\nEuropean Union concentrated on how to encourage \r\nand manage the f lows. That is basically a policy of \r\ninvitation and encouragement for further migratory \r\nwaves to be launched.\r\nAs Member States might know, the European \r\nUnion wanted to introduce a system of obligatory \r\nquotas to distribute migrants among the EU member \r\nStates. Hungary is among those countries that rejected \r\nthat approach and were subsequently blackmailed and \r\npunished. The European Union’s approach to tackling \r\nmigration has turned out to be very unsuccessful and \r\nharmful. If we reflect on recent years in Europe, we see \r\nthat there have been more than 30 major terrorist attacks \r\ncommitted by persons with a migratory background \r\nsince 2015. More than 300 people were killed and more \r\nthan 1,000 injured. That was not a phenomenon that \r\nEurope had previously experienced.\r\nEuropean institutions in Brussels kept on saying \r\nthat it was impossible to stop migration, but that is \r\nnot true. The truth is that migratory waves can be \r\nstopped — we Hungarians have proved it, with the \r\nassistance of several Central European countries, such \r\nas the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland. We are \r\nspending more than €1 billion to build a fence on our \r\nsouthern border and have placed police and military \r\nofficers there. We have proved that, yes, it is possible to \r\nstop the migratory waves, and it is possible to protect \r\nthe borders of the countries I mentioned. Very recently, \r\nthe Italian Minister of the Interior made an attempt to \r\nstop migratory waves on the maritime route. Instead \r\nof being praised, he was attacked very severely, as \r\nHungary has been.\r\nBased on the experiences of recent years, \r\ninternational efforts should seek to stop the migratory \r\nf lows and put an end to policies that encourage further \r\nmigratory waves. They are harmful and must be \r\nended immediately. With respect to international law, \r\ninternational organizations should make it very clear \r\nthat migration is simply not a fundamental human \r\nright. It is not a fundamental human right to pick a \r\ncountry where one would like to live and, in order to \r\nget there, violate a series of borders and ignore national \r\nand international regulations. That is not a fundamental \r\nhuman right.\r\nUnfortunately, like some EU officials, United \r\nNations officials have suggested a false context, as if \r\nmigration were a fundamental human right. But that \r\nis not true; that is not the case. Despite recent global \r\nevents that have proved that migration is a dangerous \r\nand unfavourable phenomenon that poses serious \r\nsecurity challenges to many regions of the world, \r\nUnited Nations officials have tended to speak about \r\nmigration as a source of prosperity, innovation and \r\nglobal wealth. It is as though migration were the best \r\nthing ever that happened to humankind; but that is a \r\nfalse and biased claim. That is why Hungary strongly \r\nopposes that position.\r\nThe United Nations is currently preparing to \r\napprove the global compact for safe, orderly and \r\nregular migration. I can tell Member States that that is \r\nthe worst possible thing that the United Nations could \r\ndo with regard to responding to the challenge posed \r\nby migration. Unfortunately, the United Nations is \r\npreparing to commit the same kind of mistake as was \r\ncommitted by the European Union. It is not without \r\ngood reason that the United States left the negotiation \r\nprocess at the very beginning and that the Hungarian \r\nGovernment has also decided to disassociate itself, \r\nbecause we do not accept the principle of the global \r\ncompact on migration. We do not accept the global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration itself, \r\nand we will not take part in the approval mechanism. \r\nAs we have stated, we absolutely do not consider it to \r\nbe an obligation.\r\nThe global compact for safe, orderly and regular \r\nmigration is a strongly biased, unbalanced and \r\nextremely pro-migration document. That is why it is \r\nvery dangerous and will cause much harm to the world \r\nby encouraging further mass and illegal migratory \r\nwaves. We strongly disagree with the basic approach of \r\nthe global compact on migration, which tries to portray \r\nmigration as though it provided a definition for the \r\nfuture of our globalized world, making us all countries \r\nof origin, transit and destination. Hungary does not \r\nwant to be any of those three; we believe exactly the \r\ncontrary, that the international community must respect \r\nthe sovereignty of each country.\r\nThe international community must respect the right \r\nof States to make the safety and security of its own \r\ncitizens a priority, and the international community \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n34/65 18-30110\r\nmust respect the right of countries to decide whom \r\nthey will and will not allow to enter their territory. All \r\ncountries, all nations, have the right to decide with whom \r\nthey would like to live. The international community \r\nshould — and must — support countries in safeguarding \r\ntheir historical, religious and cultural heritage, as well \r\nas their social structure. The international community \r\nclearly must not put pressure on any country to get rid \r\nof its values or heritage or to change such phenomena.\r\nUnfortunately, the global compact on migration \r\nsuggests that migration would be the best answer to \r\nthe challenges regarding demography and the labour \r\nmarket. We strongly disagree with that. We believe \r\nthe contrary — that the international community must \r\nrespect the sovereign rights of every country to make its \r\nown decisions regarding its own economic and social \r\npolicy, which is supposed to be the most successful for \r\nthat given country. The international community must \r\nrespect the sovereign right of a country to control its \r\nown policies with regard to labour market regulations, \r\neconomic policies and addressing demographic trends.\r\nThe global compact on migration suggests that \r\nthe border protection measures of certain countries \r\nshould be judged based on human rights. We find \r\nthat approach extremely dangerous and harmful. That \r\nis why we strongly reject it. We believe the contrary. \r\nWe believe that the protection of borders is a national \r\nsecurity issue and is the obligation of every single \r\ncountry. Let me underline the fact that every State \r\nhas the right and the responsibility to control its own \r\nborder. The international community must support \r\nevery State in successfully carrying out its border \r\ncontrol responsibilities. The international community \r\nmust make it clear that the illegal crossing of borders \r\nis a serious criminal offence. We must terminate \r\npolicies that either encourage or mitigate illegal border \r\ncrossing and those who commit that offence. Crossing \r\nborders should be possible only with full respect for \r\ninternational and national regulations. The violation of \r\nsuch regulations must result in serious consequences.\r\nThe global compact on migration also suggests that, \r\nby definition, a multicultural society is more valuable or \r\nbetter than a homogeneous society. Again, we strongly \r\nreject that definition and approach because it must be \r\nleft up to the decision of the respective nation whether it \r\nbelieves that a multicultural society or a homogeneous \r\nsociety is more valuable. We Hungarians do not think \r\nthat our society would be less valuable or worse than \r\nany other society that considers itself multicultural.\r\nHowever, in sum, the greatest problem is that \r\nalthough the text of the global compact on migration \r\nstates that the compact places individuals at its core, \r\nunfortunately, that is not true. The truth is that the \r\ncompact takes only the rights, interests and well-\r\nbeing of migrants into consideration and does not say \r\nanything about the already existing fundamental human \r\nrights of those who would like to live their lives in their \r\nhomes in safe and secure circumstances. I would like \r\nto make it clear that Hungary bases its migration policy \r\non common sense. We do not want to see the events \r\nof 2015 repeated in Hungary. For us, the security and \r\nsafety of Hungary and the Hungarian people are the top \r\npriority — first and foremost, security.\r\nWe continue to firmly and strictly protect our \r\nborders. We will not allow anyone to enter the territory \r\nof Hungary illegally. Instead of considering migration, \r\nwe will continuously modernize our education system \r\nand help families to be able to raise more children in \r\norder to address the challenges of the labour market and \r\ndemography in the meantime. We will preserve Hungary \r\nas a Hungarian country that is proud of its history and \r\nheritage. We urge the international community not to \r\nencourage further migratory waves to be launched but \r\nto stop the migratory f lows now.\r\nThe international community must recognize that \r\nevery person has the right to live in his or her homeland \r\nin peace and security. If that is not possible, we must \r\nhelp them to live in a dignified manner as close to their \r\nhomes as possible until they can return there. Instead of \r\nsuggesting that people risk their lives by taking to the \r\nroad, pay millions of euros for the services of smuggling \r\nnetworks and leave their homes, we should bring help \r\nto where it is needed. Hungary helps the Christian \r\ncommunities in the Middle East. We spend many \r\nmillions of euros on reconstructing houses that have \r\nbeen torn down, building schools, covering the medical \r\nexpenditure of hospitals and giving scholarships to \r\nyoungsters in the region. Church leaders from the \r\nMiddle East usually ask us not to encourage members \r\nof their communities to leave but to help them to be \r\nable to stay where their communities have lived for \r\ncenturies, or at least a long time.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to inform \r\nrepresentatives that Hungary will not support the \r\nadoption of the global compact on migration because \r\nit is not in the national interest of our country. We will \r\nnever give up our sovereign right, namely, that it is \r\nexclusively the Hungarian people who have the right \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 35/65\r\nto make a decision about the future of Hungary, our \r\ncountry. We will always adhere to that right of ours.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Gilles Tonelli, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Monaco.\r\nMr. Tonelli (Monaco) (spoke in French): In \r\nFebruary, President Espinosa Garcés presented her \r\nstrategic vision for the seventy-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly: “Dialogue and strengthening of \r\nmultilateralism as a catalyst for the well-being of \r\nall persons and a sustainable planet”. We welcome \r\nher commitment to the theme “Making the United \r\nNations relevant to all people: global leadership and \r\nshared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies”.\r\nThe delegation of Monaco will support her so that, \r\ntogether, we can contribute to aligning our institutions \r\nwith the Sustainable Development Goals to ensure \r\nthat the high-level political forum that we will hold \r\nhere next year delivers the necessary adjustments \r\nfor the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nDialogue and the promotion of multilateralism with \r\na human face were also priorities of her predecessor, \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák. Under his presidency, the \r\nwork of the General Assembly at its seventy-second \r\nsession facilitated the vital progress necessary for \r\nUnited Nations decisions to remain relevant. I would \r\nparticularly like to emphasize the repositioning of the \r\nUnited Nations system for development as well as the \r\nglobal compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, \r\nwhich is to be formally adopted in Marrakech in \r\nDecember. We warmly thank him for having always \r\nlistened to our representatives and for having prioritized \r\nthe common interest, which is the guarantor for the \r\nsuccess of multilateralism.\r\nAs the General Assembly commemorates the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights on 10 December, how \r\ncan we not recall the fact that, as the Preamble to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations states, the reason that we, \r\nnations great and small, have committed to working \r\ntogether is “for the promotion of the economic and \r\nsocial advancement of all peoples”?\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nPresident Bachelet for having rightly taken up the torch \r\nof Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein as United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We assure her of our \r\nsupport and congratulate Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein \r\non never having avoided difficulties and on having \r\nassiduously championed the defence of human rights.\r\nThe United Nations and its Member States have \r\ncontinuously adapted to the new challenges posed by \r\nviolence, conflict, transnational organized crime and \r\nthe global scourge of terrorism. When the Security \r\nCouncil acts, it does so to ensure on behalf of all States \r\ninternational security and the protection of civilians. \r\nWhen the Council is prevented from acting, civilians, \r\nin particular women and children, pay an even higher \r\nprice. In that regard, can we ignore the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/72/865), which notes in its \r\nparagraph 5 that in 2017, armed conflicts resulted in \r\n6,000 proven cases of violations committed against \r\nchildren by Government forces and more than 15,000 by \r\nnon-State armed groups? That is why Monaco supported \r\nthe code of conduct regarding Security Council action \r\nagainst mass atrocity crimes at the seventieth session of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nIn that spirit, we strongly condemn attacks against \r\nschools and hospitals, sexual violence and the denial \r\nof access to humanitarian aid. We firmly believe in \r\nthe role of women in peace processes. We support the \r\ninvolvement of young people in the prevention and \r\nresolution of conflicts. In that understanding, Monaco \r\nsupports Security Council resolutions on such issues.\r\nAs the Monaco Red Cross celebrates its seventieth \r\nanniversary this year, I would like to recall the \r\nPrincipality’s commitment to strengthening respect \r\nfor international humanitarian law. We also take this \r\nopportunity to pay tribute to all the men and women who \r\nhave dedicated their lives to the Organization, tirelessly \r\nworking to ensure that United Nations values prevail, \r\nand to the peacekeepers and United Nations officials \r\nwho have died in the discharge of their mission.\r\nOur country strongly supports the appointment by \r\nthe Secretary-General of a Victims’ Rights Advocate, \r\nentrusted with placing rights and dignity at the heart \r\nof the Organization’s efforts and the zero-tolerance \r\npolicy towards sexual harassment. We also hope that \r\nthe principle of the responsibility to protect, contained \r\nin the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), \r\nwill at last be acknowledged and harnessed as a tool for \r\nprogress accepted by all.\r\nSince joining the United Nations, Monaco has \r\nsignificantly strengthened its legal arsenal. Over \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n36/65 18-30110\r\nthe past 25 years, Monaco has ratified, adhered to or \r\naccepted more than 40 international treaties on human \r\nrights, refugees, privileges and immunities, criminal \r\nissues, disarmament, the environment and the law of \r\nthe sea and has signed eight such treaties.\r\nEven if today less than 10 per cent of the world’s \r\npopulation lives below the poverty line, the fact is \r\nthat millions of human beings, including women and \r\nchildren, still live below that threshold and consequently \r\nare without access to education, health care, decent \r\nhousing and work and opportunities for economic and \r\nsocial development.\r\nIn a world where artificial intelligence is developing \r\nand where genetic engineering and cyberspace are \r\nrealities for many of us, how can we disregard the \r\nfact that more than 68 million people were forcibly \r\ndisplaced in 2017 and that the United Nations has \r\ndelivered assistance to a record number of 105 million \r\npeople in 40 countries? Is it acceptable that three out \r\nof 10 people do not have access to safe drinking water \r\nand six out of 10 to sanitation? The Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund, to which the Principality contributes, \r\nhas also funded emergency assistance in 36 countries \r\nto the tune of $418 million.\r\nAs we know, the many crises and challenges that \r\nI have mentioned are interlinked. In that spirit, we \r\nadopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1). However, what is the paramount \r\nchallenge facing our human societies today? It is \r\nclearly that of climate change. Its systemic effects spare \r\nno region of the world and equally are factors in the \r\ngeopolitical upheaval that exacerbates the inequality \r\nand conflict that daily we strive to combat in this forum. \r\nToday, if we do not act ambitiously and effectively to \r\ncombat that scourge, tomorrow we will have to be ready \r\nto live on a devastated planet, where it will be very \r\ndifficult to maintain peace.\r\nI therefore endorse the Secretary-General’s \r\ncall, issued earlier this month, to end the paralysis, \r\nindifference and weak commitments to the challenge \r\nof climate change. Today, the term “crisis” is nearly \r\nobsolete. As Mr. Guterres recalled, to prevent the \r\nworst, we must change course by 2020. That is why it \r\nis imperative that the negotiations of the twenty-fourth \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nto be held in Katowice, result in the adoption of rules \r\nallowing for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. \r\nFor future generations, we must rise to that challenge.\r\nMonaco is no exception to that framework. At the \r\nnational level, the energy transition pact, launched at the \r\nbeginning of the year, is ambitious and seeks to achieve \r\nthe goal set by His Serene Highness Prince Albert II \r\nof achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 following a \r\n50 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030. \r\nThat initiative represents a new concrete action by the \r\nRoyal Government in order to meet the objectives of \r\nthe Paris Agreement. The pact is a partnership among \r\nall elements of society and demonstrates the will of \r\nthe Sovereign Prince for Monaco to remain a land of \r\ninnovation, all the more so if that is likely to accelerate \r\nthe transition to a carbon-free world.\r\nIn that regard, we also welcomed with the keenest \r\ninterest the Secretary-General’s intention to convene a \r\nclimate summit in 2019. A few days before, Monaco \r\nwill have hosted a meeting of the Intergovernmental \r\nPanel on Climate Change with a view to issuing \r\nthe special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a \r\nchanging climate.\r\nThe maxim that there is no development without \r\npeace and no peace without development has \r\ncontinuously guided our work since the Earth Summit \r\nin Rio de Janeiro in 1992. However, progress is uneven \r\nand sometimes too slow to ensure that all the goals and \r\ntargets will be met by 2030. That necessary adaptation \r\nto the challenges of implementing the 2030 Agenda \r\nis an important step towards initiating a paradigm \r\nshift that will bring more coherence, efficiency and \r\nvisibility to the work of our Organization, even though \r\nit is of course the primary duty of each Member State \r\nto remain mobilized.\r\nIn that regard, Monaco also prioritizes partnerships \r\nin its international cooperation given the long-standing \r\nevidence. We can achieve our united actions only by \r\nleveraging best practices and by constantly reviewing \r\nthe technical opportunities based on our past experience.\r\nOur cooperation with local non-governmental \r\norganizations in partner countries is based on trust \r\nand human involvement. The size of our territory \r\nhas naturally led us to look towards others. Trust in \r\nthe links established with Monaco’s 11 international \r\ncooperation partnership countries makes it possible \r\nto support exclusively through grants more than 130 \r\nprojects a year in priority sectors, namely, education, \r\nhealth, food security and socioeconomic integration. \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 37/65\r\nThe Principality remains a committed and resolute \r\npartner in doing its part to make the new paradigm of \r\nsustainable development a reality for all.\r\nOur faith in multilateralism is anchored in the \r\nreality of a world of evolving threats. The Principality \r\nof Monaco shoulders its responsibility by implementing \r\nthe principle of one State, one vote enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Monaco is convinced \r\nthat the United Nations alone remains a centre for \r\nharmonizing the actions of nations towards shared \r\ngoals. The authors of the Charter were visionaries. Like \r\nthem, we must constantly renew our commitment to \r\nsaving succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to quote Seneca, who \r\nsaid: “It is not because things are difficult that we do \r\nnot dare; it is because we do not dare that they are \r\ndifficult.” Given the proliferation of challenges, let us \r\ndare to stand closer together. Even if not everything \r\nwill be resolved in an easily measurable time frame, \r\nlet us promote understanding among people and respect \r\nfor our differences. I would be remiss if I did not \r\nreiterate our full trust in Mr. António Guterres and his \r\ntransformative initiatives, which will make the United \r\nNations better suited and more likely to effectively and \r\nefficiently meet the challenges of tomorrow.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on Her Excellency Ms. Marise Payne, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Commonwealth of Australia.\r\nMs. Payne (Australia): We are all proud members \r\nof this venerable institution. If this place and our \r\nmembership in it stand for anything, then we stand for \r\nan international order based on rules and cooperation. \r\nThat principle guides our actions, our dealings with \r\neach other, and our treatment of collective challenges \r\nas they arise before us. Australia recognizes the reality \r\nof a world in which the power of great States shapes \r\nthe international system in which we seek to advance \r\nour national interests. That is the grain with which we \r\nall work.\r\nWe also hold true to the following simple \r\nproposition — we will be safer and more prosperous \r\nin a world where global differences are managed and \r\nglobal challenges met by agreed rules rather than by \r\nthe exercise of power alone. Strong global cooperation \r\nsets a tone and sets in place rules and norms for \r\nconstructive diplomacy in every region of the world. \r\nThat is true even in a period of rapid and accelerating \r\nchange and of rising nationalism and geopolitical \r\ncompetition. Our most urgent global challenges will \r\nnot be solved by countries acting alone; solutions begin \r\nwith collaboration.\r\nIn Australia’s 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper, \r\nwe set out an analysis of the trends that are shaping \r\nthe world. Most importantly, we set out our policy \r\nresponse. In a very competitive and contested era, \r\nAustralia is taking responsibility for its own security \r\nand prosperity. At home, we are investing in our \r\nnational resilience and strength, ensuring that our \r\neconomy is strong and that Australians are safe. We are \r\nsovereign and independent. In our region — the Indo-\r\nPacific — we seek a neighbourhood in which the rights \r\nof all States are respected, and in which adherence to \r\nrules delivers lasting peace. Internationally, we are \r\ncommitted to promoting and protecting the rules and \r\ninstitutions that support stability and prosperity, and \r\nenable collective action to meet global challenges.\r\nAt this time of change, challenge and opportunity, \r\nwe representatives of Member States have the honour of \r\npreserving and advancing international rules and order \r\nso as to deliver on the expectations of our people for a \r\njust, fair and secure world. One proof of the necessity of \r\nthe United Nations is the hard fact that we cannot, with \r\nall confidence, rid the world of nuclear weapons — not \r\ntoday or this year.\r\nGiven that reality, we must redouble our efforts \r\nto prevent nuclear proliferation and to build the \r\ninternational trust and confidence necessary to move \r\ntowards a world free of nuclear weapons. Our peoples \r\nexpect us to continue to work towards verifiable nuclear \r\ndisarmament with sound compliance, safeguards and \r\nenforcement regimes. Overwhelmingly, our peoples \r\nexpect us to prevent further proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons. To do that, we must continue to build on \r\nthe progress we have made through the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nFor that reason, Australia supports the Joint \r\nComprehensive Plan of Action on Iran’s nuclear \r\nprogramme, as long as Iran abides by its commitments. \r\nIt is in our collective interest that controls on Iran’s \r\nnuclear programme remain in place. And for that \r\nreason, the world watches with anticipation the \r\nnegotiations between the United States and North Korea, \r\npursuing the complete, verifiable and irreversible \r\ndenuclearization of the peninsula, in accordance with \r\nUnited Nations resolutions.\r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n38/65 18-30110\r\nAustralia will also continue to fully implement \r\nour obligations under Security Council resolutions \r\nand maintain our own autonomous sanctions, while \r\nawaiting real progress towards denuclearization. In \r\naddition, we have most recently witnessed a new \r\npattern of indiscriminate slaughter through the use \r\nof chemical weapons, including the weaponization of \r\ntoxic industrial chemicals such as  chlorine. We have \r\ncollectively agreed that the use of chemical weapons \r\nanytime, anywhere and under any circumstances is \r\nunjustifiable and unacceptable.\r\nAs Member States, we must defend our long-\r\nstanding prohibition on the use of chemical weapons and \r\nbe prepared to abide by our collective right and resolve \r\nto investigate allegations and to verify compliance with \r\nthat prohibition. Australia joins those calling for Syria \r\nto cease the use of chemicals as weapons. Australia also \r\ncontinues to urge Russia and all nations to reinforce the \r\nprohibition on the use of chemical weapons anywhere.\r\nAustralia, like the United Nations, is committed to \r\nimproving humanitarian assistance in fragile settings. \r\nI commend the Secretary-General for establishing the \r\nUnited for Gender Parity initiative, and for declaring \r\nzero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse. \r\nAustralia is also a robust and strong contributor to \r\nthe Organization’s women and peace and security \r\nagenda, first set out in Security Council resolution 1325 \r\n(2000). Australia was one of the first Member States \r\nto draw up a national action plan on women and peace \r\nand security, and we are continuing work on our next \r\nfive-year national action plan.\r\nExamples of our work on that issue include a \r\nbenchmark of a minimum of 15 per cent of female \r\nmilitary members deployed on Australian peacekeeping \r\nmission teams, which I was proud to support over the \r\npast three years in my previous role as Australia’s \r\nMinister for Defence. Australia also has active training \r\nprogrammes on women and peace and security in \r\nAfghanistan, Iraq and the Philippines, where our \r\nmilitary is assisting partner forces to deal with counter-\r\nterrorism and counter-insurgency challenges.\r\nAustralia firmly believes that it is only through the \r\ninclusion of women in all aspects of peace and security \r\ninitiatives, including negotiations, the design of peace \r\nprocesses and the management and enforcement of \r\npeace programmes, that lasting and resilient security \r\ncan be achieved.\r\nMany here will remember my predecessor and \r\nfriend Julie Bishop’s determined and sustained work \r\npursuing accountability for the downing of Malaysia \r\nAirlines f light MH-17. Australia remains resolutely \r\ncommitted to that objective, and we will continue \r\nworking with our Joint Investigation Team partners to \r\npursue justice for the victims and their loved ones.\r\nIn expecting other Member States to abide by \r\ninternational rules, we must also subject ourselves to \r\nthose same standards and expectations. On 6 March, \r\nhere in New York, Australia and Timor-Leste signed \r\na new maritime boundaries treaty. The treaty was \r\nthe successful result of the first-ever compulsory \r\nconciliation initiated under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. It underscores \r\nAustralia’s commitment to international law and is \r\na testament to the way in which international law, \r\nin particular the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea, enables countries to resolve disputes \r\npeacefully and properly, abiding by the rules. The \r\nconciliation process created the space for compromise \r\nand negotiation on what I acknowledge was a previously \r\nintractable disagreement, and ultimately strengthened \r\nbilateral relations.\r\nWhen Member States work together to uphold \r\ninternational law and the institutions that support it, \r\nthe benefits accrue to all alike — the powerful and the \r\nweak, the large and the small. That is a long-standing \r\nprinciple that all we share, regardless of our culture, \r\nlanguage, religion or political system. We are all equal \r\nbefore the law.\r\nAustralia particularly welcomes the active \r\nengagement of the United Nations in our region, the \r\nIndo-Pacific. It is a dynamic region that in recent \r\ndecades has experienced an economic transformation \r\nthat is unprecedented in human history. The region’s \r\nrising prosperity has been built on a strong foundation of \r\nstability. Australia is absolutely committed to ensuring \r\nthat the fundamental principles that have enabled the \r\nregion’s success are maintained.\r\nWe are committed to a region in which the rights \r\nof all States are respected, where there is respect for \r\ninternational law and other norms, where disputes are \r\nresolved peacefully, and where open markets facilitate \r\nthe free f low of trade, capital and ideas. In order to \r\nachieve those outcomes, Australia is strengthening its \r\nIndo-Pacific bilateral relations, because they are among \r\nour most important in their own right and because strong \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 39/65\r\nbilateral relations help us support our regional goals. \r\nOur aid programme is an important mechanism through \r\nwhich we support the aspirations of our neighbours. It is \r\npredominately and unashamedly focused on the Indo-\r\nPacific region, and geared to expand opportunities \r\nfor people, businesses and communities to promote \r\neconomic growth and further reduce regional poverty.\r\nWe work in sectors that drive economic growth \r\nand human development, including aid for trade, \r\ninfrastructure, education and health, and the \r\nempowerment of women and girls. And we work in \r\nways that are most effective, including with United \r\nNations resident coordinators, and through the region’s \r\npolitical, security and economic architecture.\r\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN) sits at the heart of our region. It is the \r\ncollective voice of South-East Asia. There are good \r\nreasons why Australia is ASEAN’s longest-standing \r\ndialogue partner. We are both committed to driving \r\ncontinued strong regional economic growth, and we \r\nshare optimism for the future. At the same time, we \r\nshare a conviction of the need to tackle head-on the \r\nsecurity challenges of our region, including the fight \r\nagainst terrorism. As the convener for more than 50 \r\nyears of the Indo-Pacific’s most important diplomatic \r\narchitecture, particularly the East Asia Summit, ASEAN \r\nplays a vital role in the security, stability and prosperity \r\nof the Indo-Pacific region. Australia’s interests are well \r\nserved by ASEAN, and our commitment to its continued \r\neffectiveness and success is stronger than ever.\r\nThat commitment was there for all to see at the \r\nASEAN-Australia Special Summit, held in Sydney in \r\nMarch. The Summit marked a new era in the strategic \r\npartnership between ASEAN and Australia. Leaders \r\nissued the Sydney Declaration, which comprehensively \r\nsets out ASEAN and Australia’s shared commitment \r\nto working together towards a more secure and \r\nprosperous region.\r\nIn other key pieces of regional architecture, the \r\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum seeks to \r\nbuild upon the growing interdependence of the Asia-\r\nPacific’s 21 member economies. The Asia-Pacific \r\nEconomic Cooperation forum meeting in Papua \r\nNew Guinea in November will provide an important \r\nopportunity to foster cooperation and economic activity \r\nacross borders to the mutual benefit of all. I commend \r\nPapua New Guinea for the significant work that it has \r\ndone to host the 2018 forum, and I look forward in \r\nparticular to a very successful Leaders’ Week in Port \r\nMoresby later this year.\r\nI also commend our Pacific neighbour, the Republic \r\nof Nauru, for its successful hosting of the 49th Pacific \r\nIslands Forum in the first week of September. With \r\nthe theme of “Building a strong Pacific: our islands, \r\nour people, our will”, the member States, associate \r\nmembers, observers and dialogue partners of the Pacific \r\nIslands Forum continued the long tradition of amity, \r\nconsultation, partnership and policy development on \r\ndiverse matters such as climate change, economic \r\nreform, transport and trade.\r\nAustralia is committed to working with States \r\nmembers of the Pacific Islands Forum and United \r\nNations resident coordinators to strengthen resilience \r\nto climate change and natural disasters in the Pacific. \r\nThe United Nations Development Programme is a \r\nvital partner in that effort. Australia recognizes that \r\nPacific island countries are particularly vulnerable to \r\nthe effects of climate change and disaster, and that that \r\nproblem is a leading priority for the region. The Pacific \r\nIslands Forum Boe Declaration, released last month at \r\nthe meeting by member States, takes a contemporary \r\nview of security, inclusive of human and environmental \r\nsecurity, and emphasizes the importance of regional \r\ncooperation and collaboration in building resilience to \r\ndisasters and climate change.\r\nIn 2018, Australia joined the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the first time. In the Council Australia \r\nworks for and seeks to develop a region that promotes \r\naccountability and respects international law for the \r\nbenefit of all — nations and people. Australia has been \r\na strong supporter of the Independent International \r\nFact-finding Mission on Myanmar, and we have been \r\ndeeply disturbed by its findings. We are working \r\nwith Myanmar and with ASEAN and regional and \r\ninternational partners to find long-term solutions \r\nto that complex crisis, including with Indonesia \r\nas co-chairs of the Bali Process and through joint \r\nhumanitarian efforts in Cox’s Bazar. Australia will \r\ncontinue to work with the Myanmar Government and \r\nthe international community to achieve a long-term and \r\ndurable resolution of Myanmar’s complex problems. \r\nAfter 50 years of isolation and instability, Myanmar \r\nis at a critical stage in its democratic and economic \r\ntransition, and it is in all our interests to ensure that \r\nit succeeds. Let us honour the late former Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, by renewing our efforts to see \r\nfully and genuinely implemented the recommendations \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n40/65 18-30110\r\nof the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, which \r\nhe so ably led.\r\nInternational institutions, and the United Nations \r\nin particular, help us to adapt collectively as our world \r\nchanges around us. But as Secretary-General Guterres \r\nnoted when he opened the General Assembly earlier \r\nthis week:\r\n“[t]rust in global governance is also fragile, as \r\ntwenty-first-century challenges outpace twentieth-\r\ncentury institutions and mindsets” (A/73/PV.6, p.1).\r\nThat is why Australia supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts to reform the United Nations. We \r\nneed to work together to keep pace with the needs \r\nand aspirations of the people we serve. But in order to \r\nremain fit for our times, the United Nations must remain \r\ntrue to the founding principles, the universal rights and \r\nobligations that we agreed upon when we first came \r\ntogether as Member States. Chief among them is the \r\nsovereign equality of all States. Member States must \r\nrededicate themselves to the aspirations of the founders \r\nof the Organization and take to heart the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, so that our world can indeed be a more \r\njust, fair and secure place to live.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Kairat Abdrakhmanov, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\r\nMr. Abdrakhmanov (Kazakhstan): This year, as \r\nwe commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of \r\none of the greatest sons of humankind, the late Nelson \r\nMandela, I would like to begin my statement with a \r\nquote of his: “It is so easy to break down and destroy. \r\nThe heroes are those who make peace and build”.\r\nWe have approached the seventy-third session of \r\nthe General Assembly with an increased number of \r\nproblems compared with last year, including a lack of \r\ntrust and mutual respect. We find ourselves in a state of \r\nprofound worldwide crisis that touches every aspect of \r\nthe life of each and every person in our interconnected \r\nand rapidly accelerating world. Millions of people \r\nlive under the shadow of dreadful wars, such as in \r\nSyria, Yemen and many other corners of the globe. \r\nKazakhstan believes that war can never be a lasting \r\nsolution to any problem.\r\nBased on that conviction and sharing the belief that \r\nthe only viable solution to the current crisis in Syria is an \r\ninclusive and Syrian-led political process, we launched \r\nthe Astana process to strengthen confidence-building \r\nmeasures among the conflicting parties in Syria.\r\nOur far-reaching commitment is embodied in \r\nthe 2016 anti-war manifesto, entitled The World. \r\n21st Century, by Kazakhstan’s President, Nursultan \r\nNazarbayev, who stated in that treatise that the main \r\ntool for resolving all disputes between States should \r\nbe peaceful dialogue and constructive negotiations on \r\nthe basis of equal responsibility for peace and security, \r\nmutual respect and non-interference in domestic affairs. \r\nIt is a road map for peace, and it calls for the effective \r\nuse of all tools available — from early warning, conflict \r\nprevention, diplomacy and mediation, peacekeeping \r\nand peacebuilding to sustainable development.\r\nAt a time of crisis, we believe that it is of the utmost \r\nimportance for the United Nations to stay close to the \r\npeople around the world and to ensure that no one is left \r\nbehind. We have to overcome differences and reaffirm \r\nour shared commitments to the values enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nMy country has become a net contributor to peace, \r\nsecurity and stability, as well as to economic and social \r\ndevelopment, not only in our region but far beyond. \r\nWe have carefully preserved peace and harmony in our \r\nmulti-ethnic and multireligious society by stressing \r\nand enforcing the equality and dignity of every citizen. \r\nWe have achieved that while also creating an effective \r\neconomic model — our economy has grown more than \r\n20 times from the day that my country emerged as an \r\nindependent State.\r\nLooking forward, Kazakhstan has a clear vision for \r\nits future development. By 2050, we seek to become \r\none of the top 30 most advanced economies in the \r\nworld, meeting the highest global standards in terms \r\nof economic performance and transparent governance, \r\nespecially the demanding standards of the Organization \r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development.\r\nAs a new model of economic growth, President \r\nNazarbayev announced his plan in his annual address \r\nearlier this year, called “New development opportunities \r\nunder the fourth industrial revolution”. It outlines \r\nthe path for our country to follow in order to achieve \r\nthose ambitious goals. That new road map focuses \r\non industrialization, the further development of our \r\nresource potential, the use of smart technologies, which \r\nprovide a chance for a breakthrough in the development \r\nof our agricultural industry, increasing the efficiency \r\nof transport and logistics infrastructure, relaunching \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 41/65\r\nthe financial sector, and strengthening human capital \r\nas the basis of modernization.\r\nAt the global level President Nazarbayev has put \r\nforward the G-Global initiative, an information and \r\ntechnology (ICT) platform aimed at ensuring wide and \r\ninclusive dialogue on the need to find common solutions \r\nfor global economic and financial shortcomings. The \r\nplatform unites prominent international scientists, \r\nentrepreneurs and politicians.\r\nIn the regional context, we are committed to further \r\nextending our partnership with Central Asian countries \r\nand to enhancing our common capability to withstand \r\nthreats and challenges. Today in Central Asia a new \r\nreality has been formed. We consider the political, \r\neconomic and cultural potential of the region to be a \r\ncommon resource, the most rational and effective use \r\nof which is achievable only in a collective format.\r\nOur shared goal is to create a model for a zone of \r\npeace, security, trust, development and cooperation in \r\nour region of Central Asia and beyond. Several features \r\nof such a zone are already in place, as exemplified by \r\nthe Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States, \r\nthe International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea and \r\nthe latest Summit of that Fund, which demonstrated \r\nstrong political collaboration among regional leaders \r\non subjects including the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in Central Asia and other mechanisms.\r\nBeing the first country from the region to be \r\nrepresented on the Security Council, we have deepened \r\nour focus on the situation in Afghanistan with its full \r\nimplications and threats in the broader regional context. \r\nMoreover, Kazakhstan has for many years contributed \r\nsignificantly to peace in and the rehabilitation of that \r\ncountry. We believe that the revival of that country as a \r\nprosperous and peaceful neighbour will have a positive \r\nimpact on overall security in our region. A special role \r\nin that process should be played by Afghan women.\r\nIn order to increase international awareness and \r\nsupport for the needs of Afghan women and girls, \r\nwe hosted the Regional Conference on Empowering \r\nWomen in Afghanistan in September in Astana. It \r\nwas attended by female politicians, parliamentarians, \r\nentrepreneurs and civil-society members from \r\nAfghanistan and the Eurasian region. The event gave \r\ngreat impetus to strengthening the role of women, \r\nnot only in Afghanistan but in the whole region of \r\nCentral Asia, thereby helping to improve their lives and \r\ninfluence their futures.\r\nNew globalization trends have revealed cross-border \r\nthreats and challenges, which requires a new paradigm \r\nto address them. Those transnational challenges are \r\nspecific, but common to particular regions, especially \r\nconflict-prone ones, and they necessitate a transition \r\nfrom a country-specific to a regional strategy to tackle \r\nthem. A regional strategy becomes effective with the \r\nwhole-of-system coordination of the activities of United \r\nNations structures region-wide.\r\nAs a pilot case, we offer the establishment of \r\na United Nations regional hub for the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) in Almaty, our southern \r\ncapital. The city already hosts more than  a dozen \r\nUnited Nations offices with regional, subregional and \r\nmulti-country mandates. That solid United Nations \r\nfield presence has successfully promoted the SDGs in \r\nour region for years, and I am happy to announce that, \r\nas a host country, we will provide those offices with a \r\nstate-of-the-art, fully equipped and furnished building, \r\nspecifically designated and designed as per United \r\nNations and international requirements, by the end of \r\nthe year.\r\nAs an example of regional cooperation, I would also \r\nlike to outline the results of the Caspian Summit held a \r\nmonth ago in the city of Aktau, in western Kazakhstan. \r\nWe all are extremely satisfied and proud that the \r\nlong-awaited legal status of the Caspian Sea has been \r\nagreed on and determined by the five littoral countries. \r\nThe treaty creates a solid legal basis for further \r\ncomprehensive interaction among all the Caspian \r\nStates, strengthening regional security and stability, as \r\nwell as the efficient use of sea resources. I would like \r\nto emphasize that the Caspian Sea has become an area \r\nof peace, harmony, good-neighbourliness and enhanced \r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nToday, the ability of countries to show global \r\nleadership and responsibility is being challenged by \r\nnumerous threats — from the spread of both conventional \r\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), \r\nterrorism, extremism, organized crime and all forms of \r\ntrafficking, to food, water, energy and health insecurity \r\nthe violation of human rights, particularly the rights of \r\nwomen, youth and children, which degrades human \r\ndignity, and the lack of respect and justice for all.\r\nKazakhstan is trying its best to stay in the vanguard \r\nof efforts to tackle those international challenges and \r\nto seek innovative solutions to them. We fully support \r\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General to implement his \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n42/65 18-30110\r\nreforms of the peace and security architecture and the \r\nUnited Nations development system and management. \r\nWe will contribute to improving shared responsibility \r\nfor, transparency and the overall coordination of all \r\nUnited Nations bodies with a view to achieving those \r\ngoals. We are engaged in reforming the methods of work \r\nof the Security Council so as to enhance its relevance, \r\ntransparency, accountability and effective capacity to \r\nrespond speedily to varying crises.\r\nKazakhstan remains committed to strengthening \r\npeacekeeping by ensuring clear and achievable \r\nmandates, highly qualified personnel and adequate \r\nresources. We will increase our contribution to United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations through innovative \r\nforms of partnerships, including co-deployment. We \r\nwill deploy a unit and additional officers to United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions during this seventy-\r\nthird session and expand their number in future.\r\nBeing fully supportive of the concept of preventive \r\ndiplomacy, conflict prevention and confidence-building, \r\nthe President of Kazakhstan initiated the creation of \r\nthe United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive \r\nDiplomacy for Central Asia, as well as the Conference \r\non Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in \r\nAsia, which comprises 27 countries, spanning from the \r\nMiddle to the Far East and South-East Asia.\r\nMy country has proved itself to be a moral leader \r\nin nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, after \r\nhaving renounced the world’s fourth-largest nuclear \r\narsenal and the world’s largest nuclear test site, in \r\nSemipalatinsk. We call upon all other countries to \r\nfollow our example, as nuclear weapons do not ensure \r\neither real power or true protection. Protection comes \r\nfrom trust in the international community.\r\nKazakhstan signed the Treaty on the Prohibition \r\nof Nuclear Weapons on 2 March, following its engaged \r\nparticipation in the elaboration and adoption of the \r\nTreaty. We are now processing its ratification. The early \r\nentry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty remains a key goal for us. Our country, one \r\nof the most impacted by the harmful consequences of \r\nnuclear tests, is making great efforts to bring the world \r\nto global zero. We therefore sponsored resolution 64/35, \r\nwhich established the International Day against Nuclear \r\nTests. Three weeks ago, the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations commemorated the ninth observance of \r\nthe Day, with the General Assembly firmly supporting \r\nan urgent and complete end to all nuclear testing.\r\nThe creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones remains \r\none of the most effective measures for combating \r\nthe spread of WMDs. With that in mind, President \r\nNursultan Nazarbayev proposed strengthening \r\ncooperation among nuclear-weapon-free zones and \r\nconvening inter-zone conferences on a regular basis. \r\nAstana proposes hosting the first such meeting.\r\nWe have also steadfastly advocated for the \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula and call on \r\nall the parties involved to agree on mutually acceptable \r\nconditions to sustain the negotiation process. We \r\nalso support preserving and ensuring the proper \r\nimplementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \r\nAction for Iran, as well as a thorough investigation of \r\nchemical-weapons crimes in Syria and the prevention \r\nof chemical terrorism.\r\nCountering terrorism is of special significance \r\nfor my country. Kazakhstan has ratified 16 of the 19 \r\nUnited Nations instruments on combating terrorism, \r\nwith measures taken for the early accession to the \r\nremaining three treaties. Stronger global leadership in \r\nfighting terrorism remains crucial. We must do more to \r\naddress the roots of radicalization, using best practices \r\nand relevant United Nations instruments.\r\nWe are actively working under the Joint Plan of \r\nAction for the implementation of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy in Central Asia. \r\nHaving contributed $300,000, Kazakhstan has become \r\nthe first donor to its third phase, and we thank other \r\ndonors too.\r\nIn his address to the General Assembly in 2015 \r\n(see A/70/PV.13), President Nazarbayev put forward \r\nseveral counter-terrorism initiatives: the creation of a \r\nglobal counter-terrorism coalition or network and the \r\nadoption of a comprehensive United Nations document \r\non combating terrorism. In that context, our country \r\nhas offered the Code of Conduct towards Achieving \r\na World Free of Terrorism and invites all countries to \r\nclosely coordinate in the fight against that evil. We \r\ncommend all our partners for their support. The Code \r\nsigning ceremony was held earlier this afternoon at a \r\nspecial high-level event, with more than 70 Member \r\nStates having endorsed the document, for which we are \r\nvery grateful. The Code remains open for signature by \r\nother States, and we invite them all to manifest their \r\ngoodwill in fighting that disastrous phenomenon.\r\nOur strong conviction is that comprehensive \r\nsuccess in the area of hard security is impossible without \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 43/65\r\nsuccess in achieving the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. We have launched a number of initiatives to \r\nimplement the SDGs: the renowned international Expo \r\n2017 exhibition on the theme of future energy; the \r\nPost-Expo International Centre for Green Technologies \r\nand Investment Projects; the Astana International \r\nFinancial Centre; the annual Astana Economic Forum; \r\nthe KazAlD development agency; the Regional Hub of \r\nthe Civil Service; the Regional Centre for Disaster Risk \r\nReduction; and the Central Asian Regional Information \r\nand Coordination Centre for combating illicit \r\ntrafficking in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances \r\nand their precursors. All those and many other projects \r\nhave many promising prospects for the future.\r\nKazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked \r\ncountry, and it is also a part of the biggest landlocked \r\nregion of Central Asia and Afghanistan, and the \r\nfarthest away from any ocean. It has made many strides \r\nin achieving connectivity and in turning what can be \r\ntermed “landlockedness” into “landlinkedness”.\r\nBased on the outcomes of the implementation of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action and working together to \r\nfulfil the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action \r\nfor the landlocked least developed countries (LLDCs), \r\nwe are working to further expand communications, \r\nenhance infrastructure, boost trade and transit, counter \r\nclimate change and improve energy security. Recently, \r\nwe hosted the LLDCs’ Ministerial Meeting on Trade \r\nand Trade Facilitation in Astana.\r\nWe are ready to share our experiences in promoting \r\nthe goals of our large-scale third modernization \r\nprogramme, geared towards joining the top 30 most \r\ndeveloped nations, and we offer our assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries. In that context, South-South \r\ncooperation is gaining importance for us. Together \r\nwith the United Nations system and other partners we \r\nwill continue to extend assistance to African countries. \r\nWe will work under the Africa-Kazakhstan partnership \r\nfor the SDGs, and we will continue to work with small \r\nisland developing States.\r\nThe recent establishment of the Islamic \r\nOrganization for Food Security in Astana will \r\ncontribute to humanitarian assistance efforts through \r\nthe creation of food reserves. Also, a new initiative \r\nof the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in the \r\narea of science and technology will serve the purpose \r\nof narrowing the digital and ICT gap between the \r\ndeveloped and the developing countries.\r\nMr. Ten-Pow (Guyana), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nKazakhstan’s hallmarks, among many others, are \r\npluralism and interfaith accord. They are promoted \r\nthrough an unprecedented dialogue platform, namely, \r\nthe Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional \r\nReligions in Astana. The sixth Congress of that kind \r\nwill take place next month in Astana. Its added value \r\nis that it brings together religious and political leaders, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society and turns \r\nthe paradigm of conflict and clashes of cultures and \r\nreligions into a unique model of tolerance and harmony. \r\nPresident Nazarbayev has unveiled a new programme \r\nof spiritual modernization of Kazakh society called \r\n“spiritual enlightenment”, which blends traditional \r\nwith contemporary elements. I can convey the essence \r\nof the initiative by recalling his words that in dreaming \r\nof our great future, we should not forget about our \r\nworthy past.\r\nBefore I conclude, I reiterate that it is only through \r\nour collective will and solidarity that we can turn this \r\nworld in crisis into a world of hope and promise. The \r\nUnited Nations should stay open and relevant to all \r\npeople, since it is our common responsibility to leave \r\na strengthened and well-used heritage to move towards \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies where no \r\none is left behind.\r\nIn conclusion I want to refer again to the words \r\nof Nelson Mandela, namely, that it is in our hands \r\nto create a better world for all who live in it. We \r\nneed to turn our goodwill and good words into good \r\nactions. That is what we desperately need today. The \r\nPresident of Kazakhstan, His Excellency Mr. Nursultan \r\nNazarbayev, clearly stated that the time to look ahead \r\nis now; the time for action is now; the time to show our \r\nwill is now; and the time to make a difference is now.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Kyaw Tint Swe, Union Minister for the Office of \r\nthe State Counsellor of Myanmar.\r\nMr. Kyaw Tint Swe (Myanmar): We live in \r\nchallenging times. This year’s theme, “Making the \r\nUnited Nations relevant to all people: global leadership \r\nand shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies”, is therefore most appropriate. It \r\nserves to remind us of the need to strengthen the role \r\nof this important Organization if we wish to overcome \r\nthe complex challenges we face today. In that process, \r\nwe must not forget the core principles of the Charter \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n44/65 18-30110\r\nof the United Nations, including the principle of \r\nsovereign equality. It is also important to remember \r\nthat the promotion of economic, social, cultural and \r\nhumanitarian interests, as well as the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, \r\ncan be attained only through international cooperation. \r\nFurthermore, we should not forget the international \r\ncharacter of the United Nations.\r\nIt is only through constructive and peaceful \r\napproaches that we will be able to create a better United \r\nNations — one that is relevant to all nations. Only \r\nthen can our hopes for global leadership with shared \r\nresponsibilities become a reality. Here I wish to stress \r\nthat Myanmar’s view on the role of the United Nations \r\nremains unchanged. There is no suitable multilateral \r\nplatform other than the United Nations where countries \r\ncan work together to find solutions to overcome \r\nglobal challenges.\r\nLet me apprise the Assembly of our efforts to \r\ntransform Myanmar from an authoritarian system \r\ninto a democratic one and of our efforts to bring \r\nabout sustainable development and build a society \r\nwhere stability, peace and harmony prevail. A country \r\nwithout peace and stability cannot achieve economic \r\ndevelopment. Of that we are convinced. Accordingly, \r\nour democratically elected Government has given \r\npriority to national reconciliation and peace since we \r\nassumed office.\r\nWe are convinced that ethnic strife and armed \r\nconflicts in Myanmar can be ended only through \r\npolitical means. Lasting peace will become a reality \r\nonly when the democratic federal union to which our \r\npeople have aspired is established. We are therefore \r\nconducting negotiations at the Union Peace Conference \r\nto reach agreement on the fundamental principles for \r\na democratic federal union. The three sessions of the \r\nconference held so far have resulted in the adoption \r\nof 51 fundamental principles that will become part of \r\nthe Union Peace Accord. To ensure that the process \r\nis inclusive, we have continued negotiations not only \r\nwith the eight ethnic armed groups that have signed the \r\nNationwide Ceasefire Agreement but also with those \r\nthat have yet to come on board.\r\nDuring the past year, two more ethnic armed \r\ngroups, namely, the New Mon State Party and the Lahu \r\nDemocratic Union, joined the peace process by signing \r\nthe Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement. We will continue \r\nour endeavours to bring all ethnic armed organizations \r\nunder the umbrella of the Nationwide Ceasefire \r\nAgreement and to the conference table.\r\nEssential to our endeavours to bring peace and \r\nprosperity to the nation is the need to ensure balanced \r\ndevelopment in the economic, social and environmental \r\nspheres. To that end, the Government has adopted the \r\nMyanmar Sustainable Development Plan 2018–2030, \r\nwhich is in accord with the United Nations 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. Among its \r\nimportant goals are peace, national reconciliation, \r\nsecurity and good governance. The success of the Plan \r\nrequires not only national endeavours but also the \r\ninvolvement and commitment of development partners \r\nand international organizations.\r\nHuman rights and inclusiveness are fundamental \r\nto the successful transformation of Myanmar into a \r\ndemocratic society. The Government has spared no \r\neffort to nurture democratic norms and practices among \r\nall its citizens. Those efforts include the promotion of \r\nthe rule of law, good governance and the protection \r\nof human rights, and the fostering of civil society. \r\nAll those elements are essential for the emergence of \r\na democratic federal union in which the security and \r\nprosperity of all citizens are ensured. It is a supremely \r\nchallenging task, particularly for a f ledgling democracy. \r\nHowever, Myanmar is strong in its resolution to build \r\nthe democratic society to which our people aspire.\r\nResolving the issue in Rakhine state is an important \r\ncomponent of our democratic process. Our Government \r\nhas consistently exerted all possible efforts to bring peace \r\nand development to Rakhine. Within weeks of assuming \r\nthe responsibilities of governing, the Government set \r\nup the Central Committee for the Implementation of \r\nPeace, Stability and Development in Rakhine state \r\nin May 2016 under the chairmanship of the State \r\nCounsellor, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. That was followed \r\nby the establishment of the Advisory Commission on \r\nRakhine State in September 2016, headed by the late \r\nKofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations, to provide recommendations for bringing \r\npeace, stability and development to Rakhine state.\r\nI wish at this point to pay tribute to Kofi Annan, \r\nwho with his immense wisdom provided us with \r\nrecommendations in his desire for us to reach our goal \r\nof peace, prosperity and security.\r\nBarely a month after the Advisory Commission was \r\nestablished, an extremist terrorist group, called Aga \r\nMul Mujahidin — later renamed the Arakan Rohingya \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 45/65\r\nSalvation Army — launched attacks on three border \r\npolice posts in northern Rakhine state. The attacks \r\nwere premeditated, well organized and designed to \r\ninvoke fear among the inhabitants, as well as to incite \r\nviolence and attract international attention.\r\nThe Government, despite the attacks, continued \r\nwith its efforts to seek sustainable solutions for Rakhine \r\nstate. The Advisory Commission presented its final \r\nreport to the Government of Myanmar in August 2017. \r\nIt contains 88 recommendations towards achieving \r\nlasting peace and stability in Rakhine. We have set \r\nup an implementation committee, and I am happy to \r\nreport that we are now implementing 81 out of the 88 \r\nrecommendations made by the Commission.\r\nWithin hours of the release of the Advisory \r\nCommission’s final report, Arakan Rohingya Salvation \r\nArmy terrorists carried out simultaneous attacks on 30 \r\npolice outposts and one army battalion headquarters. \r\nHere, it must be stressed that the Arakan Rohingya \r\nSalvation Army attacks of 2017 were not only against \r\nthe security forces but also against various communities \r\ninhabiting Rakhine state. The attacks opened a chapter \r\nof fear and instability that led to a large outf low of \r\nrefugees to Bangladesh. International attention has been \r\nfocused on the outf low but has overlooked the broader \r\npicture of the various reasons — immediate as well as \r\nlong-standing — that brought about the displacement \r\nof those people. Nevertheless, the Government has \r\npersisted in its sincere efforts to address as a whole the \r\nneed for stability, reconciliation and the development of \r\nall communities in Rakhine.\r\nWe deeply sympathize with these displaced \r\npersons, especially the women and children, and \r\nhave taken steps to effect the early repatriation of all \r\ndisplaced persons from Rakhine who are verified as \r\nresidents of the State. To that end, we have signed three \r\nbilateral agreements with Bangladesh. In line with these \r\nbilateral agreements, the necessary preparations have \r\nbeen made, and we have been ready to receive verified \r\nreturnees from Bangladesh since 23 January. We call \r\non Bangladesh to fulfil its commitments in accordance \r\nwith these bilateral agreements so as to allow without \r\ndelay the return of verified persons under voluntary, \r\nsafe and dignified conditions. A number of people have \r\nreturned of their own volition, having made their own \r\narrangements. They have been systematically registered \r\nand processed and are now with their relatives and \r\nfamilies in their own homes. However, not even a single \r\ndisplaced person has been repatriated by Bangladesh as \r\npart of the implementation of the bilateral agreement. \r\nThe only way to resolve the issue swiftly and peacefully \r\nis through the implementation of bilateral agreements, \r\nworking together in the spirit of good-neighbourliness \r\nand refraining from activities that might be inimical to \r\nthe national interests of either Myanmar or Bangladesh.\r\nWe recognize the crucial role of the United Nations \r\nin addressing the issue of Rakhine. Accordingly, the \r\nGovernment of Myanmar signed a memorandum of \r\nunderstanding with the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme and the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees with a view to assisting \r\nthe speedy and efficient resettlement and rehabilitation \r\nof returnees. The United Nations team has started this \r\nprocess, and we are looking forward to its feedback.\r\nThe Myanmar Government has expressed its \r\nserious concerns over the report of the independent \r\ninternational fact-finding mission on Myanmar \r\npublished by the Human Rights Council on 12 September \r\n(A/HRC/39/64). Due to our Government’s serious and \r\ngenuine concerns about the advisability of fact-finding \r\nmission’s establishment, composition and mandate, \r\nMyanmar objected to the mission’s creation from the \r\nvery beginning, At a time when we are working hard to \r\nbuild harmony on the ground, we are concerned that the \r\nrelease of the report, which is based on narratives and \r\nnot on hard evidence — a point which I energetically \r\nemphasize — will serve only to further inflame \r\ntensions and could potentially hinder our efforts to \r\ncreate the much-needed social cohesion in Rakhine. In \r\nthis regard, I would like to stress what accountability \r\nshould mean to all of us. Accountability should mean \r\ntaking responsibility for one’s actions. Accountability \r\nmust apply equally to all. Individuals, organizations \r\nand national Governments — as well as multilateral \r\norganizations — must be held responsible for the \r\nconsequences of their words and actions.\r\nAs the Assembly will also be aware, the Government \r\nof Myanmar has resolutely rejected the International \r\nCriminal Court’s 6 September ruling in connection \r\nwith Rakhine state. Our position in this regard is clear: \r\nMyanmar is not a party to the Rome Statute, and the \r\nCourt has no jurisdiction whatsoever over my country. \r\nThe Court’s decision was made on dubious legal grounds \r\nand applied to a situation where domestic remedies had \r\nnot yet been exhausted. I speak to all delegations today \r\nwhen I say that we, the members of the international \r\ncommunity, should be deeply concerned by the recent \r\ndecision of the International Criminal Court and the \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n46/65 18-30110\r\nvarious precedents that the Court may be setting by this \r\nruling, as well as by the way in which it was made. Such \r\naction can only erode the moral and legal authority \r\nof the Court. We are heartened that we are not alone \r\nin having grave misgivings about the Court. I would \r\nalso like to make it clear that, while the Government is \r\nunable to accept this legally dubious intervention by the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, we are fully committed \r\nto ensuring accountability where there is concrete \r\nevidence of human rights violations committed in \r\nRakhine state.\r\nWe have recently established an independent \r\ncommission of inquiry that will investigate all \r\nviolations of human rights and atrocities committed \r\nin Rakhine state as part of our efforts to address the \r\nissues of accountability, reconciliation, peace, stability \r\nand development in our country. The Commission is \r\nchaired by Ms. Rosario Manalo, former Deputy Foreign \r\nMinister of the Philippines, and comprises Ambassador \r\nKenzo Oshima, former Japanese Permanent \r\nRepresentative to the United Nations and Under-\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, and two \r\nMyanmar nationals, one of whom is a former Chairman \r\nof the Constitutional Tribunal and the other a former \r\nsenior official of the United Nations Children’s Fund. \r\nWe hope that, alongside the recommendations of the \r\nAdvisory Commission on Rakhine State, the work of \r\nthe independent commission of inquiry will become an \r\nimportant guiding light for the resolution of problems \r\nin Rakhine state.\r\nThe challenges facing Myanmar are complex and \r\nmultifaceted. However, the people of Myanmar are \r\nresilient. We stand united to face all obstacles and to meet \r\nall challenges as we strive to bring peace, development \r\nand national harmony to our country, which has \r\nsuffered from decades of conflict, underdevelopment \r\nand disharmony.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Gudlaugur Thór Thórdarson, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Iceland.\r\nMr. Thórdarson (Iceland): The United Nations \r\nhas played a critical role in promoting peace and \r\ndevelopment for all. Most indices measuring human \r\ndevelopment tell a positive story — a story of our \r\nshared success. It is a story we should tell more often.\r\nTechnological advances and social and economic \r\nprogress that we never envisioned have become a reality, \r\nwhich gives us hope that humankind can once again \r\nprove that no challenge is too big to overcome and that we \r\nare right to dream big. But dreams will come true  only \r\nwith hard work and determination. And our common \r\ngoals will be achieved only through international \r\ncooperation and by significantly accelerating the pace \r\nof progress. The United Nations is the most important \r\nplatform we have for this vital cooperation.\r\nIceland is a small country with high ambitions. A \r\ngender-equal world is one of those ambitions. We have \r\na solid record as one of the most gender-equal countries \r\nin the world, which could only happened through the \r\nhard work of women pioneers who changed our politics \r\nand our law to empower all women in Iceland, and, of \r\ncourse, with the cooperation of a few good men. Even \r\nthough more needs to be done at home, we stand ready to \r\nshare our experience with other States. Gender equality \r\nis a master key to unlocking sustainable development in \r\nall countries, in line with the goals of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development.\r\nAnother goal of ours is to make sure that future \r\ngenerations will thank us — all of us —for having \r\nworked hard to save them from the worst consequences \r\nof climate change. Given its location in the Arctic, \r\nIceland sits in the front row as a witness to disappearing \r\nice caps and environmental change. In the drier parts of \r\nthe globe, desertification continues and causes serious \r\nchallenges to people’s livelihoods. There is no doubt \r\nin my mind that climate change is fast becoming the \r\nsingle most serious challenge to global peace, security \r\nand development. While technology will be a big part \r\nof the solution — with electric cars, and with renewable \r\nenergy fuelling our economies — we will also need \r\nto nurture our soil and restore our land as key parts \r\nof our efforts aimed at fighting climate change. This \r\nperspective is reflected in the ambitious new climate \r\nstrategy of the Government of Iceland, which has been \r\nput in place to meet our Paris Agreement targets for 2030 \r\nand to make Iceland carbon-neutral by 2040. Already, \r\nall electricity and heating in Iceland is produced from \r\nrenewable resources. Our plan aims to phase out fossil \r\nfuels in transport and increase afforestation and the \r\nrestoration of wetlands.\r\nWe have joined a coalition of other countries that \r\nhave already put such plans in place because, again, the \r\nonly way forward is through cooperation. High-income \r\ncountries must do their share to reduce emissions and \r\nhelp low-income countries adapt to the effects of climate \r\nchange. In the end, our reaction to climate change has \r\nmore to do with self-preservation than self-sacrifice.\r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 47/65\r\nSustainable development, with particular emphasis \r\non the oceans, climate and energy, and social and \r\neconomic development will be among the guiding \r\nprinciples of Iceland’s chairmanship of the Arctic \r\nCouncil from 2019 to 2021. The Council has shown \r\nremarkable leadership in promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment and practical cooperation in the high \r\nnorth and could be used as a model for other regions \r\nof the world, as local actions can drive global change.\r\nIceland is firmly committed to the 2030 Agenda, with \r\nits inclusive and bottom-up approach to development. \r\nIt is a key policy priority for our Government and \r\nfeatures strong ownership and participation by both \r\nthe private sector and civil society. We look forward \r\nto the upcoming Iceland voluntary national review in \r\n2019 and are hoping for constructive feedback that will \r\nencourage us to do better.\r\nHealthy oceans and sustainable fisheries will \r\nremain at the core of Iceland’s foreign policy. To reach \r\nour goal on healthy oceans, all nations must join hands. \r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\nand its implementing agreements provide a tried and \r\ntested framework for the work ahead. Through our \r\nexperience, we have learned that the most effective \r\napproach to conservation and sustainable use of \r\nmarine resources is the regional approach. This should \r\nalso be the main approach in the new “biodiversity \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction” implementing agreement \r\ncurrently being negotiated.\r\nIn the field of marine-resource management, we \r\nstand ready to share our expertise with others. The \r\nsame applies to gender equality, green energy and \r\nland restoration, all of which are a part of the United \r\nNations training programmes in Iceland. Almost 5,000 \r\nexperts from 100 countries have been trained since the \r\nfirst programme was established almost 40 years ago. \r\nThis has been made possible because the knowledge \r\nwas fostered by Icelandic institutions and private \r\ncompanies, not least within the fishery and energy \r\nsectors. Development, trade and business can and should \r\ngo hand in glove in implementing the 2030 Agenda, and \r\nwe are pleased to note that the United Nations is taking \r\nconcrete steps to make such partnerships stronger and \r\nto bring energy, innovation and know-how into national \r\nand global efforts.\r\nIn the past few decades we have also seen \r\nincredible advances in medicine. These advances have \r\nenabled us to live longer despite increasingly unhealthy \r\nlifestyles. Yesterday, we vowed to actively cooperate in \r\nthe prevention of non-communicable diseases and the \r\npromotion of healthy lifestyles. One neglected issue is \r\nneurological disorders, including spinal-cord injuries, \r\nwhich affect a billion people worldwide. The Nordic \r\ncountries are working towards a common resource \r\ndatabase on neurological disorders to facilitate medical \r\nadvances in this area. We encourage others to do the \r\nsame, as, yet again, cooperation will be key to success.\r\nEarlier this year, Iceland took a seat on the Human \r\nRights Council for the first time. It was a proud moment \r\nfor us, to join the Council, as it came at a time when \r\nIceland is celebrating 100 years of sovereignty and the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights. We believe that human rights express \r\nthe core purpose of the United Nations. Advancing the \r\ndignity and equality of all human beings must be our \r\nfundamental goal. Only in that way can we attain peace, \r\nsecurity and sustainable development for all societies. \r\nWe firmly believe that upholding human rights is in the \r\ninterest of every State.\r\nThe Human Rights Council should be the standard \r\nbearer for respecting, protecting and promoting human \r\nrights around the globe. Its Member States must be \r\nwilling to improve human rights in their own backyards, \r\nso that our criticism does not fall on deaf ears. We will \r\nstrive to improve the Human Rights Council through \r\ndialogue and cooperation.\r\nOur priorities also revolve around promoting \r\nwomen’s human rights, safeguarding our children’s \r\nrights and upholding freedom from violence. We will \r\nwork to advance the human rights of lesbian, gay, \r\nbisexual, transgender and intersex persons, and, lastly, \r\nfocus on the connection between climate change and \r\nhuman rights.\r\nIceland’s history emphasizes that the prosperity \r\nand well-being of nations is, to a large extent, \r\ndependent upon protecting and promoting the rights \r\nof our citizens, including civil, political, economic and \r\ncultural rights. As a part of our commitment to human \r\nrights, Iceland’s new development cooperation strategy \r\nwill incorporate an approach based on human rights, \r\nwhich means that further steps will now be taken to \r\nensure that our development strategies and projects are \r\nformulated, implemented and evaluated with human \r\nrights at the forefront of our considerations.\r\nIt is better to light a candle than to curse \r\nthe darkness. The United Nations is the heart of \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n48/65 18-30110\r\ninternational cooperation but, in order to reach our \r\ncommon goals, a more efficient and effective United \r\nNations is called for. Iceland strongly supports the \r\nSecretary-General’s reform agenda aimed at making \r\nthe Organization, which was created in a different era, \r\nfit to meet the challenges of and take advantage of the \r\nopportunities offered by the twenty-first century. We \r\nshould continue to seek ways to reform the Security \r\nCouncil, its working methods and membership. It \r\nshould not be held hostage to narrow national interests \r\nwhen our house is on fire. We need to show more unity. \r\nDespite the progress that we have made in every area, \r\ndifficult conflicts remain to be resolved. Even today, in \r\n2018, we are witnessing the use of chemical weapons, \r\nethnic cleansing, war crimes, forced migration and \r\nother horrors, which should be echoes from a distant \r\npast, not everyday news.\r\nThe Syrian war has left the country in ruins, with \r\nmore than 400,000 people dead and almost half the \r\npopulation displaced. A political solution continues to be \r\nthe only viable path towards achieving peace. In Yemen, \r\nwe are witnessing a conflict that is fast becoming the \r\nworst humanitarian crisis in the world, and there seems \r\nto be no end in sight, as regional powerhouses continue \r\nto fuel the fires of war. The issue of Western Sahara \r\nremains unresolved, and the same applies to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict. The disregard for the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of Ukraine and Georgia remains \r\na wound in the European security architecture. We are \r\nseeing mounting challenges in Venezuela and continue \r\nto receive reports of the horrors committed against the \r\nRohingya population in Myanmar.\r\nWe must act and make full use of the tools available \r\nto hold those responsible to account, including before \r\nthe International Criminal Court. All these conflicts \r\nbecome even more disconcerting when we consider \r\nthat almost 250 million children are affected, which is \r\ncasting a long shadow on their future. These conflict-\r\nstricken areas and other emergencies are also the \r\ndrivers of the greatest refugee crisis since the end of the \r\nSecond World War and call for a coordinated response, \r\nupon which we hope the global compact on refugees \r\nwill be able to deliver.\r\nThe multilateral system — the very foundation of \r\nprosperity and peace — is under strain from new and \r\nchallenging political agendas in which simple answers \r\nare provided to complex questions, favouring strongman \r\npolitics over diplomacy, free trade, democracy and \r\nhuman rights. We need to stand by our convictions and \r\nprinciples both at home and abroad, while addressing \r\nsome of the legitimate grievances of our citizens. \r\nIceland has been increasing its contributions to United \r\nNations programmes and funds. We will continue to \r\nsupport the United Nations and stand by its founding \r\nvalues and principles.\r\nOn 1 December, Iceland will mark the centenary of \r\nits independence and sovereignty. This period has been \r\ncharacterized by rapid economic growth and social \r\ndevelopment. It has given birth to a society that scores \r\nhigh on almost all development indices. One might be \r\ntempted to say that this success was all our own making \r\nand good luck, but that would be far from the truth. The \r\nbedrock of our independence and success has been the \r\ninternational rules-based order with its open markets, \r\nfree trade, multilateral institutions, liberal democracy \r\nand international cooperation. This foundation should \r\nnever be taken for granted, and it falls to us — the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations — to ensure that \r\nfuture generations can enjoy the same benefits.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Elmar Maharram oglu Mammadyarov, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\r\nMr. Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan): I am pleased \r\nto begin my statement by congratulating Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés on her assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly, as the fourth-ever \r\nwoman elected to this position of great responsibility, \r\nand wish her every success in discharging her important \r\nduties. Ms. Espinosa Garcés may count on the full \r\nsupport of Azerbaijan during her tenure.\r\nWe are also grateful to His Excellency Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák for his outstanding work in presiding over the \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session. I express my \r\nprofound respect for and gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. António Guterres, for his \r\ndedicated leadership and efforts aimed at improving the \r\nefficiency of the Organization. I would also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to pay tribute to former Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan — a man of peace. His legacy will \r\nremain a true inspiration for all of us.\r\nThe theme of this year’s general debate is very \r\ntimely and embodies those issues of utmost significance \r\nfor all of us. We live in a globalized world where the \r\ninteractions among people from different countries \r\nare growing in intensity as they become increasingly \r\nextensive. Azerbaijan fully supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s determination to genuinely contribute to \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 49/65\r\npreventing wars and sustaining peace, as well as his \r\nefforts aimed at responding to conflicts and crises in \r\nan early and effective manner, assisting Member States \r\nin their endeavours to sustain peace and build resilient \r\nand prosperous societies, making the United Nations \r\nmore coherent, integrated, effective and efficient.\r\nAs we embark upon a path of implementing the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we need to \r\nregularly ask ourselves to what extent we are delivering \r\non our commitments. Coordinated efforts and shared \r\nresponsibilities among States, backed by adequate \r\nresources, are essential to securing a sustainable future \r\nand ensuring that no one is left behind.\r\nIn adopting its national development strategy, \r\nAzerbaijan has taken into account the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) and continues to \r\nimplement large-scale programmes for improving \r\ngood governance, ensuring sustainable growth, \r\nstrengthening the rule of law, promoting respect for \r\nhuman rights, facilitating access to public services and \r\nproviding for inclusive societies.\r\nWe are consistent in our efforts aimed at improving \r\nthe living conditions of our citizens. The poverty rate \r\nin the country is 5.4 per cent, while the unemployment \r\nrate is 5 per cent. The Davos World Economic Forum \r\nGlobal Competitiveness Report for 2017-2018 ranked \r\nAzerbaijan 35 out of 137 countries with respect to \r\ncompetitiveness. Among the developing countries, the \r\nWorld Economic Forum ranked Azerbaijan third on its \r\n2018 Inclusive Development Index.\r\nAzerbaijan contributes to regional development \r\nefforts through promoting connectivity. It plays \r\nan important role in bringing continents together \r\nand creating a platform for mutually beneficial \r\ncollaboration. The East-West transportation corridor, \r\nwhich was inaugurated in October 2017, is a \r\ntransportation corridor that saves at least two weeks of \r\ntime in transporting goods from Asia to Europe or the \r\nreverse. Other important projects include the South-\r\nNorth and South-West corridors, which, thanks to our \r\nefforts combined with those of neighbouring countries, \r\nhave become a reality. Azerbaijan invests substantially \r\nin those corridors and is an active participant in both \r\ninitiatives.\r\nThe first phase of the construction of the Baku \r\nInternational Sea Trade Port complex was begun \r\nin May. The handling capacity of the port will be \r\n15 million tons of cargo per year, with the possibility of \r\nincreasing it to 25 million tons in time. Azerbaijan has \r\nalso initiated a transnational broadband project, namely, \r\nthe Trans-Eurasian Information Super Highway, which \r\naims to build a transnational fibre-optic line between \r\nHong Kong and Frankfurt. It will be the shortest \r\nconnecting line between East and West, in an era of \r\ncompetition where every single second counts.\r\nToday, Azerbaijan is providing the world with its \r\nown development model, backed by internal stability, \r\ncivil unity, solidarity in society and an environment \r\nof peace and tolerance among the various peoples and \r\nreligions living together in a liberal, sustainable and \r\ndynamic economy. Inspired by its achievements in \r\neconomic development, successful social policy, rich \r\nhuman capital and traditional values of multiculturalism, \r\nAzerbaijan decided to nominate its capital, the \r\ncity of Baku, to host the World Expo 2025. Our \r\ntheme — “Developing human capital, building a better \r\nfuture” — is of universal interest and has a particular \r\nsignificance for Azerbaijan. It is also fully aligned with \r\nthe international development agenda, in particular, the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nThe region that encompasses Eastern Europe, the \r\nCaucasus and the Caspian has never hosted a World \r\nExpo. Accordingly, World Expo 2025 Baku will be \r\ntruly universal in the way it goes beyond traditional \r\ngeography and presents a vivid example of a country \r\nachieving remarkable results within a historically \r\nshort period of time — it has only been 27 years since \r\nAzerbaijan’s independence — and proposing to host an \r\nevent of the scale of World Expo. I would therefore like \r\nto take this opportunity to kindly ask States members \r\nof the International Exhibitions Bureau to vote for Baku \r\nat this year’s elections, which are to be held in Paris on \r\n23 November.\r\nSustainable economic growth has enabled \r\nAzerbaijan not only to focus on its national \r\ndevelopment strategy, but also to actively support \r\ninternational development efforts. Azerbaijan has \r\nprovided international humanitarian and development \r\nassistance to a number of countries through the Heydar \r\nAliyev Foundation and the Azerbaijan International \r\nDevelopment Agency under the auspices of the Ministry \r\nfor Foreign Affairs. Particular attention has been paid \r\nto addressing the needs of the developing and least-\r\ndeveloped countries, as well as those recovering from \r\nnatural disasters.\r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n50/65 18-30110\r\nAs we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights this year, we \r\nreaffirm our commitment to strengthening democracy \r\nand protecting human rights as top priorities for \r\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan. The Government is \r\nimplementing large-scale programmes so as to \r\ncreate the necessary conditions for all the citizens \r\nof Azerbaijan to fully enjoy all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. Education is a top priority in \r\nour domestic policy because a well-established and \r\neducated society is a guarantee of successful and \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe right to health is fully ensured in Azerbaijan. \r\nEvery year, more than 5 million people — half the \r\ncountry’s population — undergo medical check-\r\nups that are fully subsidized by funds from the State \r\nbudget. Azerbaijan was the first country in the Muslim \r\nworld to grant women the right to vote, as early as \r\n1918. Azerbaijan strives to ensure gender equality and \r\nempower women in public and social life. It is also \r\nworth noting that, as we live in a digital age, currently \r\nabout 80 per cent of the country’s population has \r\nunimpeded access to the Internet, which has become \r\nthe most favoured and practical vehicle for information, \r\nmedia, communications and the free f low of ideas \r\nand thoughts.\r\nCombating corruption lies at the heart of SDG \r\nimplementation in Azerbaijan. The implementation of \r\ninnovative approaches and technological innovations \r\nhas enabled Azerbaijan to make significant progress \r\nin curbing corruption in the public sector. Earlier \r\nthis year, the Human Rights Council unanimously \r\nadopted resolution 37/7, on promoting human rights \r\nand the SDGs through the transparent, accountable \r\nand efficient delivery of public services, which was \r\nintroduced by Azerbaijan and aims to promote the \r\nAzerbaijan Service and Assessment Network brand \r\nconcept of public service.\r\nIn early May, Azerbaijan successfully presented \r\nits periodic report within the framework of the third \r\ncycle of the Universal Periodic Review. We remain \r\ncommitted to enhancing dialogue and interaction with \r\nother United Nations human rights mechanisms, based \r\non mutual respect and understanding.\r\nAzerbaijan is one of the world’s recognized centres \r\nof multiculturalism. All ethnic and religious groups \r\nliving in Azerbaijan coexist in peace and harmony. We \r\nhave hosted numerous international events aimed at \r\nstrengthening intercultural dialogue. As a member of \r\nboth the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the \r\nCouncil of Europe, Azerbaijan launched, in 2008, the \r\nBaku Process, whose main goal is to strengthen dialogue, \r\npartnership and cooperation between the Muslim world \r\nand Europe. Implemented under the patronage of the \r\nAzerbaijani leadership, the Baku Process provides a \r\nlarge-scale platform for the exchange of knowledge \r\nthrough interreligious and intercultural dialogue.\r\nIn his most recent report on the promotion of a \r\nculture of peace and interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace \r\n(A/72/488), the Secretary-General specifically mentions \r\nthe important role being played by the Baku Process in \r\nadvocating dialogue among cultures. This year marks \r\nthe tenth anniversary of the Baku Process, and a series \r\nof events will be organized on this occasion, including \r\nthe sixth high-level Humanitarian Forum, to be held \r\nfrom 25 to 26 October in Baku.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I am pleased to announce \r\nthat Azerbaijan will assume the chairmanship of \r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries next year. \r\nThroughout its history, the Non-Aligned Movement has \r\nplayed a fundamental role in strengthening international \r\npeace and security by promoting adherence to the \r\nprinciples adopted at the Bandung Conference. The \r\nchairmanship of Azerbaijan will provide further \r\nimpetus for advancing the founding principles of the \r\nMovement, the sixty-fifth anniversary of which will be \r\ncelebrated in 2020.\r\nUnresolved armed conflicts, existing and emerging \r\nsecurity challenges and related humanitarian crises \r\nthreaten to reverse much of the development progress \r\nmade. The ongoing armed conflict between Armenia \r\nand Azerbaijan continues to represent a major threat \r\nto international and regional peace and security. The \r\nconflict has resulted in the occupation of one fifth of the \r\nterritory of Azerbaijan and has turned approximately \r\none out of every nine persons in the country into an \r\ninternally displaced person or refugee.\r\nSince the very first day of the conflict, combat \r\noperations have been conducted exclusively inside \r\nthe territory of Azerbaijan — virtually in the middle \r\nof the country — affecting its civilian population \r\nand infrastructure. In its resolutions 822 (1993), 853 \r\n(1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993), the Security Council \r\nacknowledged the fact that military force was used \r\nagainst Azerbaijan, that such actions are unlawful and \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 51/65\r\nin contradiction with the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, and that they constitute \r\nan obvious violation of the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of the country. Numerous decisions and \r\ndocuments adopted by other authoritative international \r\norganizations have been framed along the same lines.\r\nHowever, the Security Council’s key demands, \r\nincluding, first of all, the withdrawal of Armenian \r\nforces from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, have \r\nyet to be implemented. On the contrary, Armenia’s \r\npolicy and practices clearly demonstrate its intention \r\nto secure the annexation of Azerbaijani territories it \r\ncaptured through military force and in which it has \r\ncarried out ethnic cleansing on a massive scale.\r\nInitially, after changes in the Government of \r\nArmenia, there were some expectations that the new \r\nleadership would uphold democratic values and the \r\nnorms and principles of international law, including \r\nthe relevant resolutions and decisions of international \r\norganizations, particularly those adopted by the \r\nSecurity Council. Unfortunately, so far no progress has \r\nbeen observed in that regard.\r\nContrary to his earlier statements, the Prime \r\nMinister of Armenia now does not even shy away from \r\novertly attempting to regard the Nagorno Karabakh \r\nregion of Azerbaijan as part of Armenia. Such an \r\nannexationist claim not only shows utter disrespect \r\nfor the norms and principles of international law and \r\nthe resolutions adopted by the Security Council, but \r\nalso undermines the peace process mediated by the \r\nMinsk Group of the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe and its Chairs. Therefore, at \r\nthe highest political level, Armenia demonstrates that \r\nits real intentions are not the settlement of the conflict \r\nthrough negotiations, but the continuation of the illegal \r\noccupation of the Azerbaijani territories.\r\nThere are continual internal political developments \r\nin Armenia of an unstable nature, with no understanding \r\nby the international community of what is going on \r\nin there. That is why we cannot and will not rule out \r\nthe notion that the latest statements and actions of \r\nthe Armenian Prime Minister are aimed at further \r\nescalating the situation on the ground and provoking \r\narmed hostilities along the line of contact and on the \r\nborder between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But one \r\nthing is clear: full responsibility for the consequences \r\nof this negative scenario will lie entirely with the \r\nRepublic of Armenia. We therefore call upon the \r\ninternational community to send a strong message \r\nto and exert pressure on Armenia to ensure its full \r\ncompliance with international law and to immediately \r\nand unconditionally start implementing the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions adopted with regard to the \r\nsettlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict.\r\nArmenia has consistently obstructed the conflict-\r\nsettlement process and, at the same time, refuses to \r\nconduct results-oriented negotiations and regularly \r\nresorts to various provocations designed to escalate \r\nthe situation on the ground. Armenia is trying to \r\nconsolidate its occupation of the seized territories by \r\nchanging their demographic, cultural and physical \r\ncharacter and preventing the hundreds of thousands of \r\nforcibly displaced Azerbaijanis from returning to their \r\nhomes. In f lagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions \r\nof 1949, Armenia continues to implement its policy of \r\nillegally settling Armenians, particularly those from \r\nSyria, in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan.\r\nArmenia’s new leadership should understand that \r\ntheir promises to the Armenian people to make Armenia \r\nan economically developed and prosperous State \r\ncannot be possible without peace, good-neighbourly \r\nrelations and respect for the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of its neighbours. The earlier Armenia puts \r\naside its territorial claims and withdraws troops from \r\nthe territories of Azerbaijan, the sooner peace can come \r\nto our region and the sooner prospects for Armenia’s \r\ndevelopment will improve.\r\nThere is now much talk of democracy and the \r\nArmenians of the Nagorno Karabakh region of \r\nAzerbaijan. But what about the Azerbaijani population \r\nof Nagorno Karabakh and the Azerbaijanis from the \r\nseven surrounding districts who were subjected to \r\nbrutal ethnic cleansing and forced to leave their places \r\nof origin, homes and property? If the new Armenian \r\nleadership is calling itself democracy, then they have to \r\nact in accordance with the rule of law and democratic \r\nvalues. It must let those uprooted people return to their \r\nhomes, and it must withdraw its armed forces from the \r\noccupied territories of Azerbaijan, as demanded by \r\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council and other \r\ninternational organizations.\r\nAzerbaijan sincerely believes that there is no \r\nalternative to peace, stability and mutually beneficial \r\nregional cooperation, and is the most interested party in \r\nthe earliest possible political settlement of the conflict. \r\nAt the same time, no settlement of the conflict can be \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n52/65 18-30110\r\nreached if it violates the Constitution of the Republic of \r\nAzerbaijan and is inconsistent with international law. \r\nThe resolution of the conflict is possible only on the \r\nbasis of the respecting the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of Azerbaijan within its internationally \r\nrecognized borders.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Mahamat Zene Cherif, Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nAfrican Integration and International Cooperation of \r\nthe Republic of Chad.\r\nMr. Cherif (Chad) (spoke in French): At the outset, \r\npermit me to convey, on behalf of His Excellency \r\nMr. Idriss Deby Itno, President of the Republic of Chad \r\nand Head of State, the Chadian delegation’s warmest \r\ncongratulations and best wishes for success to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on \r\nher successful election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session. Chad assures her \r\nof our support as she strives to fulfil her noble mission.\r\nWe would also like to express our sincere thanks \r\nand great appreciation to her predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, for the quality of the \r\nwork conducted and the convincing results achieved \r\nduring his term. On behalf of Chad, I would also like to \r\nrecognize the leadership of Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres and thank him for his continued commitment \r\nto strengthening the role of the United Nations and \r\npromoting its partnership with regional organizations, \r\nparticularly the African Union.\r\nChad welcomes the relevance of the President’s \r\nstrategic vision for this session, “Dialogue and \r\nstrengthening of multilateralism as a catalyst for the \r\nwell-being of all persons and a sustainable planet”. The \r\nchoice of this theme is justified in many ways. We live \r\nin a world experiencing perpetual change where we are \r\nconfronted with the serious consequences of climate \r\nchange, conflicts and crises, underdevelopment, \r\nunprecedented migratory f lows, nationalism \r\nand isolationism.\r\nIn a world so deeply troubled and exposed to such \r\ndiverse and grave perils, humankind has no choice but \r\nto further unite around the shared universal values \r\nunderpinning the establishment of the United Nations, a \r\nmelting pot of nations and peoples of the world aspiring \r\nto live together in peace, mutual respect, solidarity, \r\ncomplementarity and a common destiny. Our future, as \r\nwell as that of generations to come for whom we are \r\nresponsible, depend on it.\r\nMore than anywhere else, Africa in general and the \r\ncountries of the Sahel in particular are experiencing the \r\ncombined negative effects of all these aforementioned \r\nscourges. My country, Chad, surrounded by hotbeds \r\nof conflict and crisis and in a region characterized \r\nby burgeoning terrorism, illicit trafficking of all \r\nkinds — including human trafficking related to illegal \r\nimmigration — transnational crime, drought and \r\ndesertification, is deeply affected.\r\nOn the basis of the firm conviction that there can \r\nbe no development, peace or stability without security, \r\nChad, despite its meagre resources, has been obliged to \r\nengage on several fronts in the fight against terrorism, \r\nacross the Lake Chad basin and the Sahel. Despite \r\nthe immense sacrifices made both individually and \r\ncollectively with the countries of the subregion, the \r\nterrorist threat remains present and persistent and \r\njeopardizes all our development efforts.\r\nTerrorist groups linked to vast criminal networks \r\nof all kinds of heavily armed and wealthy traffickers \r\ncontinue to test our individual response capabilities. \r\nThis does not begin to cover the efforts required to \r\naddress other security challenges such as mercenaries, \r\nthe circulation and proliferation of weapons, poaching, \r\ndeforestation, piracy and conflicts related to \r\nenvironmental degradation.\r\nAlthough it is true that the collective commitment \r\nand determination of the member States of the Lake \r\nChad Basin Commission have led, within the framework \r\nof the Multinational Joint Task Force, to the military \r\ndefeat of the terrorist group Boko Haram, the group \r\nclearly remains capable of causing harm. The Group \r\nof Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) member countries \r\nare working just as hard to deal with other terrorist \r\ngroups operating in this area with their support base in \r\nsouthern Libya.\r\nThe fight against terrorism continues with \r\ndetermination from our States, some of the poorest \r\nin the world, within the framework of both the \r\nMultinational Joint Task Force and the G-5 Sahel. Such \r\nwork is conducted on behalf and in the interest of all \r\nour States and therefore deserves the full attention \r\nand support of the international community, more so \r\nthrough action than through statements and promises \r\noften left unfulfilled.\r\nPeace and security are essential for long-term \r\nprogress and sustainable development. The stability \r\nof a region has far-reaching benefits for neighbouring \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 53/65\r\nregions and beyond, which gives rise to the need \r\nfor a comprehensive approach and coherent and \r\ncoordinated collective action to address the root causes \r\nof terrorism and conflict, including poverty, ignorance \r\nand underdevelopment.\r\nIn this regard, I firmly reiterate the call made by \r\nthe Heads of State of the G-5 Sahel member countries at \r\ntheir summit held on 6 February in Niamey, the Niger, \r\nasking the members of the Security Council to place \r\nthe G-5 Sahel Joint Force, whose purpose is to fight the \r\nthreat of terrorism, under Chapter VII of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, in order to secure its sustainable \r\nfunding and a mandate commensurate with the scope \r\nof this international threat. The operationalization \r\nand increased power and effectiveness of the Force \r\ndepend largely and fundamentally on the mobilization \r\nof resources dedicated to this cause. I would also like \r\nto reiterate our sincere thanks to Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres for his steadfast commitment, \r\nprincipled positions and advocacy for this legitimate \r\nrequest of the G-5 Sahel.\r\nAs Chad advances on the path towards \r\nsocioeconomic development, which is a guarantee \r\nof peace, stability and security, and drawing upon \r\nlessons from past and present experiences, my country \r\nintends to give priority to our partnerships to achieve \r\nconcrete results measured in terms of improving the \r\nliving conditions of our people. In this context, we \r\nwelcome the ongoing reform of the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Support System, which seeks to move \r\naway from an assistance-based model to emphasize \r\nresilience through sustainable development. We hope \r\nthat this new approach will take into account the need \r\nfor regular dialogue, the genuine needs of countries \r\nand their priorities when it comes to choosing projects, \r\nGovernment involvement in implementing, monitoring \r\nand evaluating projects, and the streamlining of project \r\napproval and disbursement procedures.\r\nIn the same vein, we welcome the approach of \r\nreviewing the United Nations integrated strategy for \r\nthe Sahel through the United Nations Support Plan for \r\nthe Sahel. We also stress the need to thoroughly involve \r\nthe countries concerned in the review process and to \r\ntake their priorities into account.\r\nDespite multiple security, environmental and \r\nsocioeconomic challenges, Chad initiated, in 2015, the \r\ndrafting of two documents on its medium- and long-term \r\ndevelopment, “Vision 2030: the Chad we want”, and its \r\nfirst five-year national development plan 2017-2021, \r\nin the context of the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nThe Government’s approval of these two documents \r\nin July 2017 was followed by the presentation of the \r\nnational development plan at the round table in Paris in \r\nSeptember 2017. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nmake, on behalf of my Government, a heartfelt call to \r\nall our partners to fulfil the pledges announced at the \r\nround table. Keeping these promises is vital for Chad.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Chad, well \r\naware of the prominent role played by women in the \r\ncountry’s development process, is tackling the gender \r\nissue as an essential component of and a key priority in \r\nthe formulation and implementation of public policies. \r\nFor this purpose, through a law adopted on 22 May, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby Itno, President of \r\nthe Republic and Head of State, made it compulsory \r\nfor 30 per cent of all civil servant appointments and \r\nelective positions to be set aside for women, with the \r\nultimate goal of gradually achieving gender parity. \r\nThis quota has already shown its effectiveness in \r\nits implementation.\r\nIn addition, we have taken specific measures \r\nto ensure the development of women, including the \r\npromotion of girls’ education and the adoption of a \r\nlaw prohibiting their early marriage. This law sets the \r\nminimum age for marriage at 18 years and provides for \r\na prison term of five to 10 years for those who violate \r\nthis prohibition.\r\nThe Lake Chad Conventional Basin is the place \r\nwhere the dramatic consequences of the combined \r\neffect of terrorist attacks and climate change on the \r\nvulnerable populations, victims of these two scourges, \r\nas well as on the environment, are most visible. We \r\nmust remember that living around Lake Chad are more \r\nthan 45 million people of diverse origin who bear the \r\nfull brunt of the consequences of the drying up of Lake \r\nChad, seriously undermining their livelihoods and \r\ndrastically limiting their resilience capabilities.\r\nThe surface area of the Lake Chad has decreased \r\nfrom 25,000 square kilometres 40 years ago to less \r\nthan 2,500 square kilometres, and the risk of its \r\ndisappearance is very real. The efforts of four riparian \r\ncountries and other members of the Lake Chad Basin \r\nCommission aimed at saving it are far from adequate to \r\nrespond to the enormity of the task alone. The gradual \r\ndisappearance of Lake Chad constitutes a major \r\necological disaster with serious consequences for food \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n54/65 18-30110\r\nsecurity and stability in the Sahel, as evidenced by the \r\nscarcity of natural resources and the development of the \r\nterrorist threat. That is why the international community \r\nas a whole must mobilize to lobby to save Lake Chad \r\nby supporting the joint initiative of UNESCO and the \r\nLake Chad Basin Commission to register Lake Chad as \r\na biosphere reservation and a World Heritage Site.\r\nThe international community is capable of \r\nachieving and must help to achieve this noble goal, \r\nwhich  is perfectly aligned with the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. In this regard, Chad once \r\nagain urges all parties to the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda \r\nto fulfil their commitments.\r\nMigration management remains one of the \r\ngreatest challenges of our time. Thousands of African \r\nmigrants, driven by desperation, are constantly trying \r\nto reach Europe and risking their lives in the process. \r\nThe f low of migrants will not cease so long as the \r\nroot causes of migration persist, including poverty, \r\nunderdevelopment, conflict and lack of opportunity for \r\nAfrican young people. In addition to this are factors \r\nsuch as demographic pressure and the adverse effects of \r\nclimate change, further accentuating the vulnerability \r\nof African societies. In the absence of appropriate \r\nsustainable migration management mechanisms that \r\ntake into account the root causes of the phenomenon, \r\nwe will never be able to put an end to the tragedy of \r\nthousands of people dying at sea or in the desert or \r\nto scenes from another era, such as that of African \r\nmigrants being sold at auction as slaves.\r\nIn that regard, we must all make a significant effort \r\nto promote economic and social development in the \r\ncountries of origin and transit of migrants in order to \r\nstabilize the situation. Improving our cooperation with \r\nthose countries is the best way to curb illegal migration. \r\nSimilarly, urgent measures must be taken to help those \r\ncurrently trapped in transit camps or caught in situations \r\nof slavery or serious violence. We must collectively call \r\non States where migrants are subjected to such violence \r\nto respect their basic rights and to bring their migration \r\nmanagement methods in line with the rule of law. The \r\nbest way for all of us to address migration challenges is \r\nto put in place f lexible mechanisms for legal migration \r\nand to consider these phenomena, which have existed \r\nsince time immemorial, as a means of bringing people \r\ncloser together and not as a threat.\r\nAt the continental and international levels, Chad, \r\nwhile remaining concerned about the persistence of \r\nconflict zones here and there, welcomes the progress \r\nmade in some countries. In the Central African \r\nRepublic, Chad welcomes the commitment of the \r\nCentral African authorities and the 14 armed groups to \r\nentering the path of dialogue under the auspices of the \r\nPanel of Facilitators of the African Initiative for Peace \r\nand Reconciliation in the Central African Republic. \r\nChad reaffirms its support for the African Initiative, \r\nwhich is led by the African Union and supported by \r\nthe entire international community. The restoration of \r\ntrust and the beginning of true reconciliation are within \r\nthe reach of the brotherly Central African people. We \r\ncall on all bilateral and multilateral partners to provide \r\nthe necessary resources for the implementation of the \r\nAfrican Initiative.\r\nIn Mali, Chad welcomes the successful holding \r\nof peaceful presidential elections and reiterates \r\nits congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim \r\nBoubacar Keita on his decisive re-election, which \r\nreflects the commitment of the Malian people to the \r\nongoing political process and peace. Chad encourages \r\nall Malian stakeholders to fully implement the \r\nAgreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali, and \r\nreaffirms its commitment to supporting Mali in its \r\nstabilization phase.\r\nIn South Sudan, Chad welcomes the peace agreement \r\nrecently signed in Addis Ababa by South Sudanese \r\nactors and congratulates the Intergovernmental \r\nAuthority on Development on the fruits of its tireless \r\nefforts. Chad urges all parties to the agreement to \r\nimplement it in good faith.\r\nChad also welcomes the very positive developments \r\nin the Horn of Africa, characterized by the \r\nrapprochement between Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well \r\nas that between Eritrea and Djibouti, and hopes to see \r\nthese processes continue.\r\nIn Libya, Chad calls on all Libyan parties to give \r\npriority to dialogue and reconciliation over armed \r\nconflict. We encourage them to use their goodwill and \r\ncommon sense to turn the page on violence. In this regard, \r\nthe international community must facilitate dialogue \r\nand inclusive reconciliation as an immediate priority \r\nwith a view to restoring peace and ultimately holding \r\ncredible, transparent and peaceful elections. It should \r\nbe recalled that the Libyan crisis has serious security \r\nconsequences for neighbouring countries, including \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 55/65\r\nChad, as a result of the chaos in southern Libya, which \r\nis a lawless area that serves as a haven for terrorist \r\ngroups, mercenary gangs and all kinds of traffickers. \r\nIn this regard, we invite all our partners to support the \r\nefforts undertaken by Libya, the Niger, the Sudan and \r\nChad within the framework of the agreement signed on \r\n31 May in N’Djamena among the four countries, with a \r\nview to securing their common borders.\r\nIn Yemen, Chad reaffirms its support for United \r\nNations efforts to promote a political solution to the \r\ncrisis and urges the Yemeni actors concerned to give \r\npriority to dialogue and comply with the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nIn Syria, Chad reiterates its support for United \r\nNations mediation efforts and calls on the parties to \r\nthe conflict to put an end to the suffering they have \r\ninflicted on their people for more than seven years \r\nby ending the violence and committing themselves \r\nresolutely to dialogue and reconciliation. Chad calls on \r\nthe belligerents to respect international humanitarian \r\nlaw and to facilitate the delivery of aid to civilians.\r\nWith regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, \r\nChad reiterates its commitment to a two-State solution \r\nwith Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace, \r\nstability and security within the June 1967 borders and \r\nwith East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.\r\nWith regard to Cuba, Chad notes with concern \r\nthe deterioration of that country’s relations with the \r\nUnited States and encourages both sides to continue the \r\nprocess of normalizing their relations. Chad reiterates \r\nits call for the lifting of the embargo imposed on Cuba.\r\nI cannot conclude my remarks without addressing \r\nthe issue of United Nations reform, namely, Security \r\nCouncil reform, which remains a major ongoing concern \r\nfor Africa. Chad stresses the urgent need to redress \r\nthe injustice done to Africa by accelerating the long-\r\nawaited reform to reflect the realities of today’s world \r\nin the United Nations system. The African common \r\nposition on this point deserves to be taken into account \r\nby all States Members of the United Nations if we \r\ngenuinely want to involve Africa in global governance. \r\nLike it or not, the Africa of the twenty-first century is \r\nindispensable, and its voice must be heard by the rest \r\nof the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Mamadi Touré, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nfor Guineans Abroad of the Republic of Guinea.\r\nMr. Touré (Guinea) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, on behalf of the President, the Government and \r\nthe people of the Republic of Guinea, I would like to \r\nconvey our sincere condolences on the death of Mr. Kofi \r\nAnnan, a great son of Africa and former Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, who dedicated his life \r\nto promoting peace, international humanitarian law \r\nand multilateralism.\r\nMy delegation would like to congratulate the \r\nPresident on her election to lead the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-third session and to assure her of its \r\nsupport for the success of her term. Guinea would \r\nlike to pay a well-deserved tribute to her predecessor, \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajcák, for his inclusive presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session, during \r\na crucial period of reform of our Organization.\r\nMy delegation also warmly congratulates \r\nSecretary-General António Guterres on his vision \r\nand the commendable efforts he has taken to give \r\na new impetus to the United Nations, which is beset \r\nby political, economic and social challenges in an \r\never-changing international context. It is clear that, \r\nin addressing those challenges, we must give priority \r\nto new, more pragmatic, effective and coordinated \r\napproaches to achieving the objectives set out in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nThe seventy-third session, under this year’s theme \r\nof “Making the United Nations relevant to all people: \r\nglobal leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”, calls \r\non us to urgently strengthen the global leadership of \r\nthe United Nations with respect to the requirements \r\nof reform and the aspirations contained in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. We must recall \r\nthat the United Nations was created in the aftermath \r\nof one of humankind’s most devastating wars, suffered \r\nthe stigma of the Cold War and was shaken by the \r\nturbulences linked to the end of that same Cold War. \r\nHowever, it has resisted all attempts to weaken it by \r\nmaking it ineffective at managing certain crises that \r\nthreaten peace and stability throughout the world.\r\nIn an increasingly interdependent world, the United \r\nNations is the only multilateral platform capable of \r\nadopting a global and concerted approach in seeking \r\nsolutions to the many challenges it faces. During a \r\nperiod of deep crisis for the Organization, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan recalled the following:\r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n56/65 18-30110\r\n“[A] group of far-sighted leaders... saw that the \r\nhuman race had only one world to live in, and that \r\nunless it managed its affairs prudently, all human \r\nbeings might perish. So they drew up rules to govern \r\ninternational behaviour and founded a network of \r\ninstitutions, with the United Nations at its centre, in \r\nwhich the peoples of the world could work together \r\nfor the common good.” (A/58/PV.7, p.3)\r\nToday, the purposes and principles contained \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations remain more \r\nrelevant than ever. The universality of the United \r\nNations in maintaining international peace, security \r\nand prosperity in the world is confirmed on a daily \r\nbasis. The multiple fields of action make it possible to \r\nassist Member States in their development processes. \r\nThat is why we must remain determined and resolutely \r\ncommitted to implementing the reforms that are crucial \r\nfor our Organization.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea supports that ongoing \r\nreform process, initiated by Secretary-General, \r\nin particular in the pillars of peace, security and \r\nsustainable development. Guinea cannot insist enough \r\non the need for Security Council reform. It is time to \r\ntake into account Africa’s demographic, political and \r\neconomic importance in order to give it the role it can \r\nand must play on the international stage and to redress \r\nthe injustice the continent has suffered by granting \r\nit two permanent seats and as many non-permanent \r\nseats. The results of the reform must ultimately lead \r\nto the establishment of a fair and equitable system \r\nof international cooperation based on solidarity and \r\nshared responsibility.\r\nThe seventy-third session of the General Assembly \r\ncoincides this year with the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea’s independence, on 2 October 1958. \r\nIn the same year, it joined the Organization as the eighty-\r\nsecond State Member of the United Nations. As we \r\ncelebrate the sixtieth anniversary of our independence, \r\nwe will be f lying the f lag of pan-Africanism. It is \r\nclear that the United Nations has been and remains for \r\nGuinea a multilateral forum that has enabled it to realize \r\nthe ideals for it has struggled so much, including its \r\npan-African vision of independence, the fight against \r\napartheid, the promotion of peace and security, and the \r\nsocioeconomic development of the continent.\r\nToday, under the dynamic leadership of the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea, His Excellency \r\nMr. Alpha Condé, our country has made significant \r\nprogress in the economic and social fields, which can \r\nguarantee a better future for the people of Guinea. \r\nThe megaprojects carried out in the energy and \r\nagriculture sectors and the creation of infrastructure \r\nthat is crucial to development have been welcomed by \r\nthe Guinean people because they are convinced that \r\nthose achievements will certainly lead to Guinea’s \r\ndevelopment by 2040.\r\nBased on the priorities of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the 2063 Agenda of the \r\nAfrican Union, Guinea has focused on the ownership \r\nand implementation of the 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. In this context, our country, at the third High-\r\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development, \r\npresented its first voluntary national review — for \r\n2018 — on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. That \r\nwas a timely opportunity for my country to share with \r\nother Member States its experience in the process of \r\nimplementing its sustainable development programme \r\nby 2040.\r\nThe Government’s determination to contribute to \r\nthe achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nwas supported by the 2016-2020 national economic \r\nand social development plan, guided by the forward-\r\nlooking “Guinea Vision 2040” plan, which aims to \r\nmake development planning the appropriate instrument \r\nfor achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In \r\nthis regard, Guinea is counting on the support of the \r\nUnited Nations and other partners.\r\nThe Government strongly appreciates the new \r\nclimate of dialogue for the promotion of sustainable \r\npeace in Africa, as peace and security are essential \r\nconditions for inclusive development. The tangible \r\nprogress achieved in the strategic partnerships between \r\nthe United Nations and African peace missions, as \r\nwell as the significant progress in crisis management \r\nin Guinea-Bissau, South Sudan, Somalia and in the \r\ndisputes between Ethiopia and Eritrea and between \r\nEritrea and Djibouti, confirm once again the need \r\nto continue to focus on political solutions to create a \r\npeaceful environment conducive to development.\r\nWe are convinced that substantial investments \r\nin conflict prevention and the quest for political \r\nsolutions will save humankind countless lives and the \r\ndestruction of infrastructure. However, these positive \r\ndevelopments that have been made here and there \r\nshould not distract us from our common struggle against \r\ninternational terrorism and violent extremism. That is \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 57/65\r\nwhy my delegation strongly condemns the barbaric \r\nacts committed against innocent people in Africa and \r\nthroughout the world. It urges the major Powers to \r\nsupport Africa in its fight against these scourges and to \r\nsupport the Group of Five for the Sahel in confronting \r\nthe atrocities committed by terrorist groups so as to \r\nrestore lasting peace in the Sahel region.\r\nGuinea welcomes the implementation of the United \r\nNations Support Plan for the Sahel, entitled “Sahel, \r\nLand of Opportunities”, which targets 10 countries, \r\nincluding Guinea. The plan focuses on six key areas: \r\ncross-border cooperation, prevention, peacekeeping, \r\ninclusive growth, climate and renewable energy. \r\nPartnerships with Member States, regional economic \r\ncommunities, civil society and donors will facilitate the \r\nimplementation of various development projects, help \r\nto fight extreme poverty, improve the humanitarian \r\nsituation, strengthen resilience to change and reduce \r\nthe scourge of food insecurity.\r\nIf there is another situation where the role of the \r\nUnited Nations remains indisputable, it is the conflict \r\nin the Middle East, which remains a major concern \r\nfor the international community. Guinea has always \r\nunambiguously expressed its unconditional solidarity \r\nwith the just cause of the Palestinian people. We remain \r\nconvinced that any viable and sustainable solution in \r\nthe Middle East necessarily means respecting and \r\nimplementing the relevant Security Council resolutions \r\nthat call for the creation of two States living side by \r\nside in security and within safe and internationally \r\nrecognized borders.\r\nConflicts — in particular protracted \r\ncrises — environmental degradation and human rights \r\nviolations continue to increase humanitarian needs, \r\nwhich are currently estimated at nearly $22.5 billion. \r\nHowever, the mobilization of funds is hampered not \r\nonly by a lack of solidarity but also the drastic cuts to \r\nthe United Nations budget. That is why the management \r\nof generated funds must be transparent and inclusive.\r\nOf all the humanitarian challenges, the issue of \r\nhuman mobility is the most consequential for us and \r\ntherefore requires greater solidarity and the sharing of \r\nresponsibilities. That is why we welcome the advent of the \r\nglobal compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, \r\nwhich is a source of hope for more than 258 million \r\ninternational migrants, composed largely of women and \r\nchildren. This important document, which the Republic \r\nof Guinea will adopt in December in Marrakech, \r\nwill strike a balance between State sovereignty and \r\nfundamental rights. The compact is fundamentally \r\naligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change and the New York \r\nDeclaration for Refugees and Migrants, while providing \r\nan important monitoring mechanism.\r\nThe achievement of social well-being through the \r\nSustainable Development Goals can be made possible \r\nonly if we succeed in ridding our world of recurring \r\ndiseases. It is therefore important to strengthen our \r\nsolidarity in the fight against communicable and \r\nnon-communicable diseases, which continue to \r\ndecimate a large part of the world’s population. My \r\ndelegation welcomes the steps taken and the progress \r\nmade in effectively eradicating tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS \r\nand other diseases. We wholeheartedly support the \r\nUnited Nations project for universal health coverage.\r\nThe creation of an inclusive society underpins \r\nthe elimination of inequalities and social barriers that \r\nprevent the participation of young people and women \r\nin economic and political activities. Gender equality \r\nand the promotion and empowerment of young people \r\nand women are fundamental to achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment and must be taken into account in \r\ndevelopment policies.\r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who has been working since his inauguration \r\nfor the achievement of parity through appointments \r\nto the higher bodies of the United Nations. We have a \r\nresponsibility to perpetuate that good practice within \r\nthe United Nations and other international and national \r\ninstitutions, as it is in line with the agreements on \r\ngender and women’s rights.\r\nI would like to conclude by emphasizing that the \r\nUnited Nations remains the only institution that can \r\nmaintain global balance and ensure our collective \r\nsecurity and shared prosperity. Any withdrawal into \r\nourselves would be detrimental to peace and stability \r\naround the world. Multilateralism therefore remains \r\nthe only way forward to effectively achieve the goals \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Mohamed Siala, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand International Cooperation of the State of Libya.\r\nMr. Siala (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): As His \r\nExcellency President Faiez Serraj is unable to attend \r\nthe general debate at this year’s session of the General \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n58/65 18-30110\r\nAssembly due to the latest developments in Tripoli, \r\nhe has asked me to deliver the following statement on \r\nhis behalf:\r\n “At the outset, allow me, Sir, to congratulate, \r\nthrough you, Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa \r\nGarcés on her election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session. I would like \r\nto wish her every success and assure her of our full \r\ncooperation as she works to realize the goals of this \r\nsession. I also thank her predecessor Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák for the efforts he made as President of \r\nthe General Assembly during the seventy-second \r\nsession. In addition, I would like to commend \r\nSecretary-General António Guterres for the efforts \r\nhe has made to fulfil the purposes and objectives of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\n“Undoubtedly, the situation of my country, \r\nLibya, continues to draw the attention of the United \r\nNations and the international community as a \r\nwhole and still requires monitoring. We appreciate \r\nand respect all those who have made sincere efforts \r\nto help us overcome the difficult circumstances in \r\nwhich we find ourself and the challenges we are \r\nfacing. We underscore the need to coordinate and \r\nintegrate these efforts and to avoid rivalries or \r\ndivergences when initiatives are launched, because \r\nfailure to do so diminishes our capacity to respond \r\nto the crisis. We believe that, before holding any \r\nregional or international meeting on the Libyan \r\nissue, it is important that there be coordination with \r\nthe United Nations so as to ensure that the outcome \r\nis compatible with the United Nations vision for the \r\nresolution of the Libyan crisis.\r\n“Since its establishment, the Presidency \r\nCouncil of the Government of National Accord of \r\nLibya has recognized the scope of the challenges \r\nthat the country is facing, namely, the upsurge in \r\nterrorism, political divergences, security instability \r\nand an exacerbated economic crisis, all of which \r\nhas had an impact on the delivery of the  necessary \r\nbasic services and therefore on the lives of Libyans \r\nthemselves. We remain committed to finding \r\nexpeditious solutions to these challenges. Last year, \r\nwe proposed a road map for overcoming the crisis \r\nbased on holding presidential and parliamentary \r\nelections, putting an end to all fighting except the \r\nfight against terrorism, and providing the necessary \r\nconditions for national reconciliation. In our view, \r\nthis approach would unify national institutions \r\nand allow us to create a modern democratic \r\nState. However, even though the relevant national \r\ninstitutions have not shown any reciprocity, we \r\nnevertheless remain hopeful, reaching out to all \r\nwith determination and sincere initiatives, with \r\na view to breaking the political deadlock that has \r\nbrought such frustration to the people of Libya and \r\nthe State alike.\r\n“We highly commend the ongoing efforts of \r\nMr. Ghassan Salamé, Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General for Libya, and his team, \r\naimed at bringing together the points of view of \r\nthe Libyan parties and seeking solutions to the \r\nwide range of issues and challenges we are facing. \r\nIn this regard, I would recall that the Government \r\nof National Accord welcomed the road map \r\nproposed by Mr. Salamé at the high-level meeting \r\non Libya in September 2017. The Government \r\nencouraged all relevant parties to show flexibility \r\nso that consensus on amendments related to certain \r\ncontroversial items in the Political Agreement could \r\nbe quickly reached, thereby creating momentum \r\ntowards implementing the remaining steps of the \r\nplan. Unfortunately, no progress has been made.\r\n“The Presidency Council of the Government \r\nof National Accord supports any path leading to \r\na comprehensive political solution, which is why \r\nwe have engaged in dialogue with those calling for \r\ngeneral elections as a way out of the political crisis. \r\nWe have facilitated the High National Electoral \r\nCommission’s efforts to register voters, and the \r\nresults have been very encouraging. The number \r\nof voters registered has been unprecedented, \r\nsurpassing our expectations and reflecting the \r\ndesire of Libyans to have elections held. We have \r\nalso allocated 60 million Libyan dinars to the \r\nCommission in order to prepare for the elections. \r\nWe have worked with the relevant parties to ensure \r\nthe security conditions needed for elections to be \r\nheld in complete freedom and integrity. We hope \r\nthat this expression of the will of the people will \r\nbe acted upon by the relevant institutions, which \r\nmust commit to seeing that the country’s interests \r\nprevail, to making all necessary legislative and \r\nlegal arrangements to end the political stalemate \r\nand to bringing all State institutions together to \r\nresolve the various problems being faced by the \r\nLibyan people.\r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 59/65\r\n“We underscore our determination to continue \r\nmaking efforts to get the country out of its crises. \r\nWe will strongly oppose all who attempt to impose \r\ntheir will through the use of weapons. We have \r\ncondemned the military attacks that took place in \r\nthe suburbs of Tripoli city a few weeks ago, which \r\nled to gross material damage and loss of human \r\nlives, terrorizing women and children and forcibly \r\ndisplacing innocent civilians. .\r\n“We highly appreciate the efforts of the United \r\nNations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), \r\nunder the leadership of Mr. Ghassan Salamé, to \r\nbring about a ceasefire agreement, and we call \r\non all relevant parties to respect that ceasefire. I \r\ngive my word that the national and international \r\njudicial bodies will be seized with the prosecution \r\nof the perpetrators of attacks for the suffering \r\nthey caused.\r\n“We are also determined to take the security \r\nmeasures needed to unify the country’s military \r\nand security institutions and establish security \r\nand peace in Libya, as stipulated by the Political \r\nAgreement. We wish to underline once again that \r\nthe use or threat of use of weapons only benefits \r\nterrorists who, amid the chaos, find opportunities \r\nto carry out their criminal acts. We saw this in the \r\nterrorist attacks in Tripoli that targeted the High \r\nNational Electoral Commission and the national \r\noil company. Accordingly, priority must be given \r\nto security and stability as an indispensable goal \r\nand urgent step that also requires active support \r\nfrom the United Nations. We therefore believe that \r\nit is important to convert UNSMIL from a special \r\npolitical mission to a mission whose purpose is \r\nto establish and support security and stability \r\nthroughout the country.\r\n“The Government of National Accord is striving \r\nto find solutions to the difficult living conditions \r\nand lack of services that Libyans are facing. It \r\nhas launched economic reforms to facilitate and \r\nimprove the living conditions of our citizens and \r\nto enhance the performance of a hitherto unstable \r\nservice sector. In this regard, we attach particular \r\nimportance to mobilizing financial resources to \r\nrespond to the needs of our people. We call on \r\nall States holding Libyan assets or funds to make \r\nthe necessary arrangements for the Presidency \r\nCouncil to be able to cover the costs of policies and \r\nprogrammes designed to help all Libyans.\r\n“My country reiterates its absolute \r\ncondemnation and rejection of terrorism in all its \r\nforms and manifestations, regardless of its origin, \r\nperpetrators or motives. We underscore that \r\nterrorism is a global phenomenon that should not be \r\nlinked to any religion or doctrine. As the Assembly \r\nis aware, my country has made enormous sacrifices \r\nto eradicate terrorist organizations with foreign \r\nfighters in their ranks, including Da’esh, which was \r\nexported to us from abroad. Not only does Da’esh \r\nthreaten the security and stability of Libya, but it \r\nalso exploits our natural resources for its own benefit \r\nas it carries out its bloodthirsty agenda — one, I \r\nwould add, that has no link to Islam. Libya has \r\nratified all international conventions related to the \r\nfight against terrorism and considers the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its \r\nfour pillars one of the most important international \r\nlegal frameworks to guide national legislation in \r\nfighting the phenomenon of terrorism.\r\n“The dangers posed by terrorist networks \r\nremain in Libya, requiring us to be vigilant and \r\nto strengthen joint coordination at all levels as \r\nwell as regional and international cooperation so \r\nthat terrorists can be tracked down and eliminated \r\nwherever they are. It is also important that regional \r\nand subregional plans and programmes, including, \r\nfor example, the outcomes of ministerial meetings \r\non bolstering cooperation in the field of security \r\nand joint monitoring of borders, continue to receive \r\nsupport. The most recent meeting on this topic was \r\nheld in the Sudanese capital, with the participation \r\nof the Sudan, the Niger, Chad and Libya, resulting in \r\na joint action plan to implement the agreement that \r\nhad been previously concluded in N’Djamena by \r\nthose four States. We hope that this action plan will \r\nreceive support from the international community. \r\nWe have expressed our support for all international \r\nefforts aimed at fighting terrorism and underscored \r\non many occasions our support for calls for holding \r\nan international high-level conference under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations on ways to unify \r\nefforts in that regard.\r\n“With respect to human rights, we emphasize \r\nour determination to uphold and protect them. \r\nAs proof of our commitment in that domain, we \r\nhave adopted several laws, including those on \r\nestablishing political parties, legalizing peaceful \r\ndemonstrations, criminalizing torture and enforced \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n60/65 18-30110\r\ndisappearances, amending the penal code and \r\ncodifying transitional justice. This legislation, \r\nwhich will soon enter into force, is designed to \r\npromote tolerance and harmony among members of \r\nour national community.\r\n“With regard to economic, social and cultural \r\nrights, the Government of National Accord has \r\ncontinually sought to promote women’s rights \r\nand gender equality, while providing free and \r\nongoing educational services and medical \r\ncare to all citizens. Pursuant to article 7 of the \r\nConstitutional Declaration, which calls for joining \r\nall international and regional conventions and \r\ncharters related to strengthening human rights, we \r\nhave ratified some of those conventions, including \r\nthe Convention on the Rights of Persons with \r\nDisabilities, to which Libya is now a party.\r\n“We once again wish to reiterate our \r\ncommitment to protecting and upholding human \r\nrights. However, we note that current difficulties \r\nin the transitional period have given rise to \r\ncertain security challenges that have led to \r\nhuman rights violations. In this regard, we look \r\nforward to benefiting from technical assistance \r\nmechanisms from the Human Rights Council and \r\nother programmes and specialized agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\n“My country pays great attention to the issue of \r\nillegal migration. We seek to address the ongoing \r\nf low of migrants being exploited by human \r\ntrafficking networks, thousands of whom have \r\nperished at sea. This kind of migration is causing \r\nhuman suffering that the international community \r\nhas been unable to address until now. Libya is a \r\ntransit country that is facing serious economic, \r\nsocial and security consequences as a result of \r\nthe migration phenomenon; indeed, the migration \r\nissue has clearly exacerbated the state of insecurity \r\nin Libya, causing many difficulties and problems \r\nacross Libyan society. It is difficult to limit the \r\nrepercussions of the phenomenon without foreign \r\ncooperation and assistance commensurate with the \r\nscope of these challenges and their consequences. \r\nClearly, the optimal solution does not lie in dealing \r\nwith it merely as a problem of security. We need \r\nto focus on the real underlying causes that push \r\npeople to seek the daunting path of migration.\r\n“Accordingly, we welcome the efforts \r\nundertaken to reach an international agreement for \r\nsafe, orderly and regular migration, to be adopted \r\nat the intergovernmental conference to be held in \r\nMarrakech, Kingdom of Morocco, in December. \r\nNevertheless, we would have liked to see the \r\ndraft agreement deal with this issue in a broader \r\nmanner. We agree on the need to protect the rights \r\nof migrants as much as possible. However, the \r\ncurrent and increasing f low of migrants excessively \r\nburdens national potentials and capabilities to \r\nsuch an extent that migrants’ rights can rarely be \r\nguaranteed.\r\n“I firmly believe that the international \r\ncommunity should support countries of origin and \r\nencourage them to develop and implement effective \r\ndevelopment programmes and projects, thereby \r\nenhancing their productive and services sectors, \r\nso that poverty, unemployment and other forms of \r\ndeprivation fall away and people can stop thinking \r\nof irregular and dangerous emigration as a solution.\r\n“My country pays great attention to issues of \r\ndisarmament and the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. It actively participates in the \r\ndeliberations in various forums on those issues \r\nand actively supports many decisions taken by the \r\nUnited Nations in the field. We fully endorse the \r\nrelevant international treaties and conventions, \r\ncognizant of the fact that producing and stockpiling \r\nweapons of mass destruction is a threat to \r\ninternational peace and security, which horrifies \r\nall members of the human race.\r\n“Moreover, Libya has participated in \r\ninternational disarmament efforts related to \r\nweapons of mass destruction and the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. In this regard, I \r\nwould like to recall that after joining the Chemical \r\nWeapons Convention, my country promptly \r\naddressed its chemical stock, in cooperation and \r\ncoordination with the secretariat of the Convention \r\nand its international partners, which eventually led \r\nus to destroying our chemical stocks.\r\n“We reaffirm our support for international \r\nefforts aimed at establishing nuclear-weapon free \r\nzones. We stress that the Middle East region as a \r\nwhole should be free of weapons of mass destruction \r\nand that all countries in the region should declare \r\nthat they possess such weapons or have the intention \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 61/65\r\nto do so. All countries in the region must also join \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons.\r\n“At the same time, we would like to underscore \r\nthe right of States to the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy. States that have abandoned weapons of mass \r\ndestruction should be supported and encouraged \r\nto train people in the area of the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear energy so that they might acquire the \r\nnecessary technical knowledge to pursue such uses.\r\n“Three years have elapsed since the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, which is \r\nfocused on 17 ambitious goals, was adopted by \r\nthe Heads of State and Government. We in Libya \r\nare facing many challenges in the achievement \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), \r\nmostly due to political and security instability. \r\nThe Assembly is aware that development is closely \r\nlinked to security; indeed, as is well known, \r\nthere is no development without security and no \r\nsecurity without development. We look forward \r\nto moving past these difficulties and to launching \r\ndevelopment plans and programmes to improve our \r\neconomy and start focusing on attaining the SDGs.\r\n“The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing \r\nfor Development stress the need of countries \r\nto mobilize financial resources to achieve their \r\ndevelopment goals. My country, Libya, is one of \r\nthe countries whose funds have been transferred \r\nabroad. We therefore call on States holding our \r\nfunds to disclose that fact and help us recover them \r\nso that we can begin to implement the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals in a serious manner.\r\n“Accordingly, we would like to recall the \r\nfrozen Libyan funds and assets of the Libyan \r\nsovereign wealth fund, which is incurring losses \r\nas a result of the sanctions imposed by the many \r\nSecurity Council resolutions adopted since 2011. \r\nWe underscore that the purpose of those sanctions \r\nwas to preserve Libyan funds and assets, rather \r\nthan deplete them. However, the assets freeze has \r\ncaused those funds and assets to incur enormous \r\nongoing losses. Since March 2016, we have \r\nprovided the Security Council and the relevant \r\nsanctions committee with clear information about \r\nour losses, and have appealed to them to amend the \r\ncurrent sanctions regime so that we can put a stop \r\nto these huge losses. Unfortunately, we have not \r\nseen any action taken in response to our justified \r\nrequests. If nothing changes, the wasting of frozen \r\nLibyan resources would in essence deprive Libyans \r\nof funds that could be invested in their future.\r\n“My delegation supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposed reforms of certain United \r\nNations bodies, and we hope that these reforms \r\nlead us to fulfilling the commitments set forth \r\nin the 2005 World Summit Outcome, namely, to \r\nconsolidate the authority of the Organization and \r\nensure its effectiveness and ability to properly \r\naddress all current challenges. Despite the progress \r\nthat has been made elsewhere, the Security Council, \r\nthe most important organ in the Organization, has \r\nyet to implement any reform. It is therefore crucial \r\nthat the Security Council, which no longer reflects \r\nthe realities of the world of the twenty-first century, \r\nundertake genuine reform.\r\n“In the face of the serious challenges \r\nthreatening international peace and security, the \r\ncurrent geopolitical situation calls for a reform \r\nprocess that results in equitable representation in \r\nthe Council. We call for an end to the historical \r\ninjustice suffered by the African continent with \r\nregard to its unfair representation in the permanent \r\nand non-permanent categories of Security Council \r\nmembership. We underline the African demand \r\ncontained in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \r\nDeclaration, namely, two permanent seats with all \r\nrights and powers, including the right to veto, and \r\ntwo non-permanent seats. This demand is in line \r\nwith the requirements of justice and the right of \r\nthe African continent to effectively participate in \r\nthe decisions made by the Council, particularly in \r\nthe light of the fact that many such decisions are \r\non African issues. The African demand reflects \r\nthe right of the continent to a minimum of fair \r\nrepresentation in the Council and offsets the \r\nmarginalization and historical injustice that Africa \r\nhas suffered. Accordingly, we also support the \r\ndemand by the Group of Arab States to be granted \r\na permanent seat on the Council.\r\n“Peace in the Middle East will not be achieved \r\nas long as the occupying Power continues to shed \r\nthe blood of innocent Palestinians, confiscate \r\ntheir land, build settlements, impose an unjust \r\nsiege on the Palestinian people, seek by any \r\nmeans to Judaize Jerusalem, and f lout all relevant \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n62/65 18-30110\r\ninternational resolutions. We join the Palestinian \r\npeople in rejecting the announcement by the \r\noccupying Power that Israel is a Jewish nation State. \r\nThis announcement risks triggering dangerous \r\nescalation and improperly resolving the Palestinian \r\nquestion by removing native Palestinians from their \r\nancestral lands and allowing them to be replaced by \r\nJewish settlers. Such practices have been soundly \r\nrejected as racist.\r\n“Furthermore, we reject attempts to change \r\nthe legal status of occupied Jerusalem, including \r\nattempts by certain States to use a policy of fait \r\naccompli, for example by transferring their \r\nembassies in Israel to the city of Jerusalem as the \r\ncapital of the State of Israel. These attempts violate \r\nrelevant General Assembly and Security Council \r\nresolutions.\r\n“We underscore our support for the Palestinian \r\npeople and their right to self-determination and \r\nto the establishment of a Palestinian State with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital. We call for the \r\nprotection of the Palestinian people and demand \r\nthat the occupying Power cease all acts of violence, \r\nterrorism, settlements and repeated attacks \r\nagainst them.\r\n“Not far from occupied Palestine, in some \r\nregions of Syria, the brotherly Syrian people have \r\nbeen facing disastrous humanitarian situations for \r\nyears as a result of a destructive conflict that has \r\ncaused immense human and material damage and \r\nled to the displacement of many innocent people. We \r\ncondemn all brutal terrorist acts committed against \r\nthe Syrian people and support all international \r\nefforts aimed at finding a peaceful solution that \r\nwould avoid dismantling and partitioning the \r\ncountry. We also support international efforts \r\naimed at fulfilling the aspirations of the Syrian \r\npeople to live a decent life in a democratic country \r\ngoverned by the rule of law, where human rights \r\nare maintained and respected.\r\n“With regard to our brotherly country \r\nYemen, we express deep concern at the disastrous \r\nhumanitarian situation unfolding there. We have \r\nspoken out against the continuing conflict that is \r\nclearly threatening the security, stability and unity \r\nof Yemeni society, as well as the security of the \r\nregion as a whole. In this context, we support all \r\nefforts aimed at stopping the bloodshed in Yemen \r\nand at alleviating the suffering of the brotherly \r\nYemeni people.\r\n“In conclusion, I would like to stress that today’s \r\nchallenges, whether they be security, economic, \r\nsocial or other types of challenge, require that \r\nwe all work together to strengthen the role of the \r\nUnited Nations so that it can adapt to developments \r\nin the international arena and resolve conflicts and \r\ncrises through peaceful means.”\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nSeveral speakers have asked to speak in exercise \r\nof the right of reply. May I remind members that \r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to \r\n10 minutes for the first intervention and to five minutes \r\nfor the second intervention and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Al-Khalifa (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nQatari delegation has requested the f loor to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply following the statement \r\nby the representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \r\nin which he made false and unacceptable accusations \r\nagainst my country. More than a year after the unjust \r\nembargo was imposed on Qatar, we can assert that \r\nit failed to achieve its goals. However, the Saudi \r\naccusations, intended to undermine the reputation of \r\nmy country, are nothing new.\r\nAs has been clearly shown, Qatar has always \r\ncooperated with the international community. Indeed, \r\nwe have made efforts to fight terrorism by cutting \r\noff the f low of resources to it, combat radicalism and \r\nachieve sustainable peace. The Saudi accusations are \r\nnot worthy of a response. However, it should be said \r\nthat when a party repeats the same accusations over \r\nand over without providing any factual evidence, that \r\nparty’s credibility is severely undermined.\r\nAs we have said in many forums, as a first step \r\nin combating the phenomenon of terrorism, we should \r\npay close attention to its sources. It is well known that \r\nterrorism has always been rooted in the type of religious \r\nradicalization advocated by Saudi Arabia to promote its \r\nown political interests. It is ironic that, from one day to \r\nthe next, radicalization rooted in religious ideology can \r\nbe suppressed and substituted with a disingenuously \r\ncivilized call made on the world stage. We see \r\nactivists, religious moderates and those calling for \r\nreform — particularly women — being put into Saudi \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 63/65\r\njails without fair trials, in violation of international \r\nlaw, as the whole world watches. Saudi Arabia’s goal \r\nis to politicize terrorism, and it will make accusations \r\nof terrorism against all who disagree with its policies, \r\nincluding against sovereign States. The State of Qatar \r\nis not the only victim; other countries have also borne \r\nthe brunt of Saudi Arabia’s crude methods.\r\nThe State of Qatar has shown wisdom and \r\nrestraint in responding to a fabricated crisis. We have \r\nused everything at our disposal to try to alleviate the \r\nsuffering caused by an unjust embargo. There were, \r\nhowever, humanitarian consequences resulting from \r\ncoercive and illegal measures that affected property \r\nrights and access to justice that cannot be redressed \r\nwithout reparations to Qatari citizens and non-citizens \r\nwhose rights were violated, to families whose members \r\nwere separated and to students who were unable to \r\ncomplete their studies.\r\nI would also like to mention the worst measures: \r\nQatari citizens and non-citizens residing in the State \r\nof Qatar were barred under fake pretexts for the \r\nsecond consecutive year from fulfilling their Hajj and \r\nUmrah religious duties. This prohibition was widely \r\ncondemned because it is a grave human rights violation \r\nand an unprecedented politicization of religious issues.\r\nDespite the unilateral measures that denied Qataris \r\nmany of their rights, amply documented in international \r\nreports, the Government of the State of Qatar has \r\nabstained from taking retaliatory measures against the \r\nbrotherly Saudi people. Moreover, we will continue our \r\nconstructive partnerships with the United Nations and \r\ncountries across the world in order to achieve tangible \r\nresults that strengthen security and sustained peace, \r\nalleviate human suffering, promote human rights and \r\nenhance the quality of relationships among countries \r\nand peoples.\r\nMr. Djani (Indonesia): My delegation takes the \r\nf loor to exercise Indonesia’s right of reply in order to \r\nrespond to the statement made by the representative \r\nof Vanuatu (see A/73/PV.12). Indonesia condemns the \r\nslander and baseless comments that the delegation \r\nof Vanuatu made in its statement this morning when \r\nreferring to the Indonesian provinces of Papua and \r\nWest Papua. Not only do these accusations undermine \r\nthe sanctity of friendly relations among nations and the \r\nprinciple of non-interference, but they also violate the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nFor many years, Vanuatu has tried to spread several \r\nfraudulent ideas — that there are f lagrant, systematic \r\nand widespread human rights violations in Indonesia; \r\nthat Indonesia neglects civil, political, social, economic \r\nand cultural rights; and that the people in the provinces \r\nof Papua and West Papua are racially different and \r\ntherefore do not belong in Indonesia. Vanuatu argues \r\nthat, based on these factors, which have been injected \r\ninto their minds by criminal individuals, the two \r\nprovinces should be the subject of debate at the United \r\nNations.\r\nWe fail to understand the motive behind Vanuatu’s \r\nintentions in supporting a group of people who have \r\nwrought terror and mayhem on so many occasions, \r\ncausing fatalities and sorrow for innocent families in \r\ntheir own communities. Indonesia categorically rejects \r\nany efforts to disturb the peace, stability and growth \r\nenjoyed by the people of Papua and West Papua, and \r\nwould like to state the following points.\r\nFirst, accusing Indonesia of committing gross \r\nviolations of human rights and inhuman acts is serious \r\nand unacceptable. No country in the world is free from \r\nhuman rights or development challenges, but accusing \r\nothers of human rights violations when one has so \r\nmany problems of one’s own is the pot calling the kettle \r\nblack. Vanuatu, which portrays itself as a champion of \r\nhuman rights, is party to only a few of the international \r\nhuman rights instruments, while Indonesia, on the \r\nother hand, is party to eight out of the nine instruments. \r\nInterestingly, Vanuatu has not ratified the International \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \r\nDiscrimination, whereas Indonesia did so a long \r\ntime ago.\r\nIndonesia is a diverse and multicultural nation \r\ncomprising hundreds of ethnic groups, thousands of \r\ntribes and hundreds of local languages. We define \r\nourselves neither on the basis of racial purity nor as \r\na single ethnic group. We reject racial discrimination \r\nin Indonesia. If we were to follow the irresponsible \r\npremise and logic of Vanuatu, then the world would \r\nconsist of tens of thousands of countries, given the \r\nmultitude of races and ethnicities in the world. I \r\nwould therefore like to take this opportunity to remind \r\nVanuatu that the customary international law deriving \r\nfrom the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and \r\nDuties of States of 1933 clearly stipulates four elements \r\nthat define a country, namely, population, territory, \r\ngovernment and capacity to enter relations with other \r\nStates. I emphatically state that neither ethnicity nor \r\nA/73/PV.13 28/09/2018\r\n64/65 18-30110\r\nrace has been stated as an underlying reason for the \r\nright to be a country.\r\nSecondly, let me provide Vanuatu with a short \r\nlesson on our history. Almost 50 years ago, through \r\nresolution 2504 (XXIV), adopted in this very same \r\nforum and in this very same Hall, all of us at the United \r\nNations decided on the final status of Papua as a rightful \r\nand legitimate part of Indonesia. The resolution, which \r\nrecognized the successful implementation of the act of \r\nfree choice, was adopted with no single country voting \r\nagainst it. The people of Papua reaffirmed their place \r\nand unity with Indonesia. In other words, what Vanuatu \r\nis putting forward is nothing more than an outrageous \r\nchallenge to a decision of the United Nations — a \r\ndecision of the then 128 States Members of the United \r\nNations almost half a century ago.\r\nIndonesia, like every other responsible member of \r\nthe United Nations, vigorously upholds the principles \r\nof the Charter. For that reason, Vanuatu’s support for \r\nindividuals whose separatist agendas seek to challenge \r\nIndonesia are an undeniable violation of the principles \r\nof the Charter and must therefore be denounced. \r\nFurthermore, it is a shame that, since last year, Vanuatu \r\nhas appointed those very individuals to serve as official \r\nmembers of its delegation. Such actions are tantamount \r\nto acts of hostility and have no place — none at all — in \r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nA country that supports separatists and the \r\ndismemberment of another country should not \r\nparticipate at a gathering of a decent, law-abiding \r\nfamily of nations. Enough is enough. We could not care \r\nless what Vanuatu’s motives are, but what we know for \r\nsure is that Indonesia will firmly and strongly defend \r\nits sovereignty, its territorial integrity and its dignity. \r\nLet that be known.\r\nMs. Danish (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\ndelegation of my country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, \r\nentirely rejects and condemns the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of Qatar.\r\nIn the two decades since the mid-1990s, Qatar \r\nhas incited peoples and supported extremists. As the \r\nheadquarters for the Muslim Brotherhood, Qatar has \r\nbeen instrumental in the creation of other such groups \r\nas the Takfir wal-Hijra group, Al-Qaida and Jabhat \r\nAl-Nusrah. It has also allowed religious extremist \r\nleaders to appear in their television broadcasts to justify \r\nsuicide attacks. Qatar has a history of harbouring \r\nterrorist groups; indeed, one Al-Qaida leader succeeded \r\nin entering the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using a Qatari \r\npassport, while other Al-Qaida members were arrested \r\nby Saudi authorities when they tried to enter our \r\nterritory using Qatari passports. Qatar is well aware of \r\nthese actions, as is the United States.\r\nQatar has also supported separatists in my country, \r\nas well as in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and \r\nKuwait, in attempts to fabricate crises to undermine \r\nthose countries’ Governments in order to destabilize the \r\nregion. The one that should be accused of harbouring \r\nand supporting terrorism is not the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia, but Qatar, for it is Qatar that is financing and \r\nsupporting terrorism.\r\nQatar’s accusations against the Government of \r\nmy country with respect to barring Qatari pilgrims \r\nare false. The Ministry of Hajj welcomes our Qatari \r\npilgrim brethren who wish to perform Hajj and Umrah \r\nafter they have completed the required procedures \r\nupon arrival at King Abdul Aziz International Airport \r\nin Jeddah. Just like pilgrims from all other countries, \r\nQataris must provide personal data, register with the \r\nHajj Ministry’s website and sign contracts with Saudi \r\ncompanies authorized to provide services to pilgrims. \r\nThere are various packages available from which \r\npilgrims can choose according to what suits them. The \r\nonly restriction is that they must arrive by air at the \r\nKing Abdul Aziz International Airport in Jeddah using \r\nany airline other than Qatar Airways.\r\nMr. Al-Khalifa (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): On \r\n5 June 2017, Saudi Arabia attempted an act of aggression \r\nagainst the sovereignty of the State of Qatar through an \r\nunjust embargo and other illegal measures proscribed \r\nunder international law and international norms. The \r\nState of Qatar has also been subject to a misleading and \r\ncheap campaign of abuse by the Saudi press and social \r\nmedia consisting of clearly fabricated false accusations. \r\nNevertheless, it is strange and regrettable that this \r\nslander has found its way into the general debate \r\nof the General Assembly, where Heads of State and \r\nGovernment are supposed to discuss how to improve \r\nrelations and promote international cooperation among \r\nStates with a view to addressing common challenges.\r\nI would like to reiterate that the State of Qatar is \r\nboldly advancing in all areas of development so as to \r\nserve our people, bring them prosperity and contribute \r\nto attaining peace and security in the Middle East \r\nregion and throughout the world. We continue to wage \r\nthe fight against terrorism, while working to strengthen \r\n28/09/2018 A/73/PV.13\r\n18-30110 65/65\r\nhuman rights. We strive to promote stability, peace \r\nand security in our region and to maintain our crucial \r\nregional arrangements, despite the efforts of others to \r\nimpose blockade policies against us.\r\nAs this is my second statement in exercise of the \r\nright of reply, in accordance with the rules of procedure \r\nof the General Assembly, I will not be able to take the \r\nf loor again to respond to the foregoing or any further \r\nallegations. My country therefore reserves the right to \r\nrespond to these allegations in writing. \r\nThe meeting rose at 10.30 p.m.\r\n"
