I also express gratitude to Mr. Miroslav Lajčák \r\nfor his active role as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its previous session.\r\nI address the Assembly at a very special time for \r\nmy country. This year, Latvia celebrates its centennial. \r\nA remarkable change occurred 100 years ago. The end \r\nof the First World War and the collapse of empires \r\nresulted in the liberation of nations and brought about \r\na fundamental revision of Europe’s political map. A \r\nnew Europe was born, which promised much more \r\nthan just self-determination, freedom and democracy. \r\nThe peoples of Europe expected lasting peace and \r\nprosperity. Those objectives were pursued both \r\nindividually and collectively. Peoples’ right to self-\r\ndetermination materialized in concrete forms. New \r\nnation States were born.\r\nThe Paris Peace Conference laid the foundations \r\nfor the League of Nations, which was the first \r\ninternational organization whose principal mission was \r\nto maintain universal peace through the development of \r\nbinding norms and multilateralism. Latvia also joined \r\nthe League of Nations, firmly establishing its status \r\nas a full-f ledged member of the international family. \r\nHowever, the weakness of the League of Nations was \r\none of the main reasons why Latvia, for a time, lost \r\nits independence. The history of both the Soviet and \r\nNazi occupations of Latvia and much of the European \r\ncontinent is a harsh reminder of what happens when \r\nserious violations of international law are tolerated. \r\nWe know all too well the consequences of allowing \r\ncountries to break those principles with impunity. In \r\nLatvia’s case, it was a life under the occupation of Nazi \r\nand Communist regimes of terror and gross violations \r\nof human rights.\r\nWe are grateful to all those nations that for \r\ndecades implemented policies of non-recognition of the \r\noccupation of the Republic of Latvia and stood by their \r\nprinciples. In accordance with international law, the State \r\nof Latvia continued to exist throughout the occupation \r\nperiod. However, the Russian Federation — the \r\nofficial successor to the Soviet Union — still does not \r\nacknowledge the well-documented facts of history. I \r\ncall on Russia to embrace the truth and clearly condemn \r\nthe actions of the Soviet Union.\r\nSince the restoration of independence in 1991, Latvia \r\nhas been advocating compliance with international law \r\nand human rights. The protection of those principles \r\nwas necessary throughout our transition to a democratic \r\nsociety, which was governed by the rule of law, and in \r\nbuilding Latvia’s international role. Today, Latvia is \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

The Charter \r\nof the United Nations starts with the words “We the \r\npeoples of the United Nations”, thus pointing out the \r\nOrganization’s aim to represent the rights and interests \r\nof every human being on the planet. The United \r\nNations was founded not only to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war and reaffirm faith \r\nin fundamental human rights but also to respect the \r\nobligations of international law.\r\nHuman rights, including women’s and children’s \r\nrights, are among the most fundamental values of the \r\nUnited Nations. The Organization must be capable \r\nof defending those values in any situation, be it \r\nthe bombing of civilians in Syria, the massacre of \r\nRohingyas in Myanmar, the persecution of Crimean \r\nTatars by the Russian authorities or other human rights \r\nviolations wherever they occur. This year, we mark 70 \r\nyears since the adoption of the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights. It remains the main global source of \r\ninspiration to continue working to ensure that all people \r\nmay live with dignity and benefit from the blessings of \r\nfreedom and equality.\r\nSecurity and human rights go hand in hand. Security \r\ncannot be achieved without respect for human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms. The freedom of the press \r\nhas been and continues to be vital to peace, justice and \r\nhuman rights for all. I therefore once again urge Russia \r\nto release the illegally detained Ukrainian filmmaker \r\nOleg Sentsov. I call on the Myanmar authorities to \r\nfree the two Reuters journalists Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa \r\nLone. I also call on Russia to immediately release the \r\nother 64 Ukrainian political prisoners it has detained, \r\nincluding journalist Roman Sushchenko. I urge nations \r\nto adhere to their commitments and obligations under \r\ninternational law and international human rights law, \r\nespecially with regard to the freedom of expression and \r\nfreedom of assembly, which have notably deteriorated \r\nin the past year.\r\nIn order to strengthen the role of the United \r\nNations, efforts should be made to uphold the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nIn August, the world lost an inspirational leader and \r\na strong advocate for peace and human rights, former \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, who argued that we \r\nwill not enjoy security without development, nor \r\ndevelopment without security, and we will not enjoy \r\neither without respect for human rights. The three \r\npillars of the Charter are greater than the sum of their \r\nindividual parts. Economic progress and sustainable \r\ndevelopment are based on long-term stability, which in \r\nturn requires peace and security and respect for human \r\nrights.\r\nThe United Nations must be able to change, \r\nundertake serious reforms and thereby respond to the \r\ndemands of the twenty-first century accordingly. We \r\nneed a relevant and efficient United Nations. Latvia \r\nwelcomes the reforms initiated by the Secretary-General \r\nin the three areas of peace and security, development \r\nand management. It is important that the reforms be \r\nimplemented swiftly. This is a unique Organization \r\nwith a heavy responsibility. The authority of the \r\nSecurity Council in maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity must be preserved. Security Council reform \r\nis long overdue, and we should all aim to strengthen \r\nthe efficiency of that important body. However, the \r\nstalemate in the reform of the Security Council must \r\nnot impede progress elsewhere. The reform of the \r\nUnited Nations must include serious improvements in \r\nthe protection and promotion of human rights.\r\nAchieving sustainable development through the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment cannot be complete without strengthening \r\nhuman rights around the world. The Human Rights \r\nCouncil must be strong and effective and have the ability \r\nto react quickly to serious human rights violations in \r\nany part of the world. Latvia is actively engaged in the \r\nprocess of improving the effectiveness of the Council. \r\nI invite all countries to join that process with an open \r\nmind.\r\nLatvia supports the Secretary-General’s vision and \r\napproach with regard to focusing on prevention at the \r\nUnited Nations. That is even more important given the \r\nincreasingly complex global security challenges that \r\nwe face. Conflicts and crises around the world that \r\ncould not be prevented drag on for years and decades, \r\ndestroying human lives, holding back development and \r\ndraining the resources of the United Nations.\r\nThe conflicts in Syria, Ukraine and Yemen continue \r\nto take a heavy toll on civilians. We must also not forget \r\nthe protracted instability in Burundi and Afghanistan. \r\nThe mere length of preventable conflicts undermines \r\nthe credibility of international organizations, including \r\nthe United Nations.\r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 3/53\r\nAs the main guarantor of international peace \r\nand security, the Security Council has a particular \r\nresponsibility in preventing conflicts, acts of aggression \r\nand mass atrocities. The use of the veto to shield narrow \r\nnational interests in situations of mass atrocities is \r\ncompletely unacceptable.\r\nTerritorial integrity and sovereignty, as enshrined \r\nin the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, must be respected by all. The Russian \r\nFederation must stop its aggression against Ukraine. \r\nTogether with the international community, we will \r\nmaintain a non-recognition policy with regard to the \r\nillegal annexation of Crimea. I believe that one day \r\ninternational law and justice will prevail and that \r\nthe territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as that of \r\nother eastern partners of the European Union, will \r\nbe restored. The United Nations, along with relevant \r\nregional players, must remain involved and committed \r\nto resolving the protracted conflicts in Nagorno \r\nKarabakh, Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \r\nThe history of the Baltic States is proof of the moral \r\npower of international law and justice. The international \r\ncommunity must be more active in resolving those \r\nissues.\r\nNo nation was ever secure in isolation. Member \r\nStates therefore have a responsibility to ensure one \r\nanother’s security. Clear consequences for aggressors, \r\nresolute international pressure and accountability for \r\nviolations of international law are essential for the \r\npolitical resolution of a conflict. Settlement of the \r\nprotracted conflicts in wider Europe remains of the \r\nutmost importance to the international community.\r\nAttaining the Sustainable Development Goals is the \r\nultimate prevention agenda. They address the drivers \r\nand root causes of instability and conflict. Investing in \r\nhuman dignity, eradicating poverty, fostering climate \r\nresilience and promoting economic and social progress \r\nwill reduce the incidence of conflict, instability and \r\ndespair.\r\nThe principles of good governance, democracy, \r\nrespect for human rights, gender equality and \r\nenvironmental sustainability therefore guide all Latvia’s \r\nactivities in the area of development cooperation. \r\nFurthermore, gender equality is vital to achieving \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals. It is an essential \r\nprecondition for inclusive sustainable development and \r\nfor economic growth and prosperity.\r\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, \r\ncombatants accounted for 90 per cent of conflict-\r\nrelated casualties. Today, 90 per cent of casualties in \r\narmed conflicts are civilians. Conventional arms kill \r\napproximately 500,000 people a year, of whom 70,000 \r\nare killed in conflict zones. Those figures clearly prove \r\nthat the international community must focus not only on \r\nweapons of mass destruction but also on conventional \r\narms.\r\nWith that in mind, Latvia will assume the presidency \r\nof the Arms Trade Treaty next year and will spare no \r\neffort to promote its objectives. I call on all States to \r\nbecome parties to the Arms Trade Treaty, which would \r\nalso contribute directly to the attainment of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nWe must join efforts to strengthen the principle of \r\nmultilateralism. In an interdependent and globalized \r\nworld, we can address and resolve global problems \r\nonly through multilateral means. In that regard, the \r\nUnited Nations stands out as a good global governance \r\ninstrument, but it is not a global Government. The \r\nability of the United Nations to meet the challenges \r\nof the world today depends heavily on the decisions \r\nof Governments and on the support of populations for \r\nthose decisions. With that in mind, I wish to emphasize \r\nthat the future of multilateralism will depend more \r\non changes in the attitudes of Member States than on \r\nreforms of the United Nations system. However, as long \r\nas the fundamental characteristics of the international \r\nsystem are not changed, the United Nations can only \r\nstrive for higher effectiveness and efficiency.\r\nWe should accept the United Nations for what it is. \r\nIt is not perfect, yet it is a very necessary instrument \r\nfor the maintenance of peace, economic development \r\nand the codification of international law for a more \r\nsecure world. The United Nations can and must be a \r\nsignificant global player, a community of nations that \r\nis proud of its values and committed to multilateralism \r\nand the principles of international law.\r\nMember States must support our Organization \r\nin order to project those values worldwide, thereby \r\naffirming its unique role on the global stage. To achieve \r\nthat purpose, the United Nations needs well-functioning \r\nnorms, efficient institutions and a clear vision of its \r\npolicies.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Rimbink Pato, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nTrade of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea.\r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n4/53 18-30190\r\nMr. Pato (Papua New Guinea): I am pleased today \r\nto address the General Assembly on behalf of my Prime \r\nMinister, His Excellency Mr. Peter Paire O’Neill, and \r\nthe Government and the people of Papua New Guinea.\r\nI congratulate you, Madam President, and the \r\npeople of Ecuador on your election as the first woman \r\nleader from the Latin American and the Caribbean \r\nregion to preside over the General Assembly. You can \r\ncount on Papua New Guinea as a partner committed \r\nto supporting your work during your presidency. I \r\nwould also like to thank the outgoing President, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, for his excellent work \r\nin the past year. It is also important to commend the \r\nleadership of the Secretary-General for the reform of \r\nthe United Nations and its systems, the United Nations \r\nbeing an organization that is so fundamental to the \r\npeace, prosperity and security of the world.\r\nThis is an exciting year for Papua New Guinea \r\nbecause, throughout 2018, we are hosting the Asia-\r\nPacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. In so \r\ndoing, our country is emerging on the global stage as \r\nnever before.\r\nLocated in the Pacific Ocean, we are part of a \r\nvast blue continent of island nations linked by sea. We \r\nalso border with South-East Asia and are within sight \r\nof Australia. We have more than 8 million people, the \r\nbiggest economy and the largest land mass of the Pacific \r\nisland countries. We are joining with our Pacific sisters \r\nand brothers in a mighty regional endeavour to protect \r\nthe ocean and its bounty and to bring prosperity to \r\nour peoples.\r\nNations near and far are learning that our country, \r\nPapua New Guinea, is a great treasury of riches. We \r\nhave the third-largest rainforest in the world, after \r\nBrazil and the Congo. We are guardians of a third of \r\nthe global supply of tuna, the fish that feeds the world. \r\nOur land is home to vast storehouses of gold, silver, \r\nnickel, oil and gas.\r\nWe are one people forged together from more than \r\n1,000 tribes. With more than 800 distinct languages, \r\nwe are the most linguistically diverse nation on Earth. \r\nLike all developing countries, we have issues to face, \r\nbut we do not let them daunt us as we strive for progress \r\nand prosperity.\r\nThis year, we are taking a giant stride as we host \r\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. The \r\nAPEC economies encompass 39 per cent of the world’s \r\npopulation and 48 per cent of the world’s trade. Among \r\nthe participants in the forum are the United States, the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China, Japan and other significant \r\neconomies. APEC itself is, in many ways, a regional \r\nexample of attempts to achieve what States Members of \r\nthe United Nations are working so hard to accomplish.\r\nMany issues are on the table either formally or \r\nin informal meetings on the sidelines, namely, first, \r\nprosperity through free trade, which is the founding \r\nrationale for the APEC-plus approach; secondly, \r\ncleaning up and protecting the natural environment; \r\nthirdly, inclusiveness, so that none of our precious \r\nhuman beings are left behind; fourthly, embracing the \r\ndigital economy; and, fifthly and very importantly, \r\ngender equality.\r\nInternational trade is an important engine for \r\ninclusive economic growth and poverty eradication, \r\nas well as a critical source for financing development \r\nand achieving sustainable development. As the host \r\nof APEC, we have opportunities like never before. \r\nIt is the largest international event in our country’s \r\nhistory. We are well prepared for the leaders summit in \r\nmid-November. The world will see the stunning APEC \r\nHouse, an outstanding architectural creation inspired \r\nby our local culture. We thank the APEC economies for \r\ntheir material and organizational support, including, \r\nin particular, Australia, Canada, China, Indonesia, \r\nJapan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, the \r\nUnited States of America and many others that are \r\ntoo numerous to mention. To add to the Pacific island \r\nf lavour of the event, we have invited all Pacific island \r\nleaders to come to our country during this time.\r\nThrough APEC, we have opportunities to attract \r\ntrade and foreign direct investment. It will continue to \r\nprovide us with access to knowledge and to a dialogue \r\nwith APEC economic leaders, who will be in attendance. \r\nSuch capacity-building support in our country will lead \r\ndirectly to business growth and the creation of more \r\njobs for our people. However, given our small and open \r\neconomy, which is subject to external forces, we join \r\nall other members of the international community in \r\npromoting respect for and the strengthening of the \r\nrules-based, international multilateral trading system.\r\nHosting the APEC event is a huge challenge for \r\na developing country such as ours, and people can \r\nsometimes paralyse themselves by focusing only on \r\ntheir perceived shortfalls or problems. But we in Papua \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 5/53\r\nNew Guinea decided to try it. That perspective also \r\napplies to our view of the United Nations and its work.\r\nOf course, we must acknowledge and work to \r\neliminate the great problems confronting us today. \r\nHowever, in doing so, let us all keep our eyes on \r\nthe prize: our vision of peace, security, a return to a \r\npristine environment and ongoing prosperity. The \r\nkey to overcoming the varied challenges lies within \r\nus — we the peoples of the United Nations. Let us \r\nwork on being united and being stronger together in a \r\nsystem based on mutual respect, friendship, dialogue \r\nand multilateralism. Unity, of course, is the answer. It \r\nis the greatest strength on the planet.\r\nTwo weeks ago, Papua New Guinea celebrated its \r\nforty-third anniversary of independence as an unbroken \r\ndemocracy. We continue to consolidate our economic \r\nand structural reforms, supported by responsible \r\nmonetary and fiscal policies aimed at having a balanced \r\nbudget. With recovering oil and gas prices and several \r\nwell-advanced new major energy and mining projects, \r\nwe are optimistic about our future economic outlook.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nis a solid pathway that holds great promise for the \r\ninternational community. The choice to enjoy its full \r\npotential lies in our hands. At the Pacific regional \r\nlevel, earlier this month, in Nauru, our forum leaders \r\nreaffirmed our collective commitment. The call for \r\ncollective action is set out in the Boe Declaration, \r\na copy of which was delivered to His Excellency the \r\nSecretary-General yesterday. At the national level, we \r\nrecognize the importance of putting in place the basic \r\nbuilding blocks needed to enable sustainable, inclusive \r\nand participatory development. Both Australia and New \r\nZealand, which are our good friends, have eloquently \r\naddressed the General Assembly on issues facing our \r\nregion and the world and on the requirements and \r\nobligations for collective action.\r\nAn essential part of our development challenge \r\nis harnessing the vastly untapped potential of our \r\nincreasing population of young people, which today \r\nconstitutes approximately 60 per cent of our total \r\npopulation. Creating employment opportunities in both \r\nthe formal and the informal sectors is a key priority in \r\nour efforts to address the needs of young people in our \r\ncountry. We have hopes for the transformative nature \r\nof the digital economy, which is truly a game-changer.\r\nIn addition, one of our greatest challenges is to \r\nprotect women and girls and to ensure that they have \r\nfull equality in our society. We believe that women’s \r\nequality is a fundamental human right. We have a very \r\nlong way to go in that area. However, we are determined \r\nto find ways to make progress towards achieving that \r\nobjective, for the sake of women and girls themselves \r\nand for the good of the nation. In fact, our long-term \r\nadvancement depends on making great strides in what \r\nwe believe is a very crucial area.\r\nWe are working hard to do that through policies \r\nand laws, combating gender-based violence, providing \r\nbusiness opportunities in the formal and informal \r\nsectors, such as microcredit schemes, and investing in \r\nour girls’ and women’s education at all levels of our \r\neducation system. The changes are noticeable in my \r\ncountry, as we have put an additional 1 million young \r\npeople in schools, many of whom are girls. We of course \r\nexpress our gratitude for the support of our multilateral \r\nand bilateral development partners, including the \r\nUnited Nations system, in assisting us in more ways \r\nthan one in achieving our goals.\r\nWe are preparing our people to cope with the \r\nincreasing dangers arising from climate change, which \r\nare very real for us. Earlier this month, as I have said, at \r\nthe Pacific Island Forum leaders meeting, in Nauru, we \r\nreaffirmed our strong commitment to working together \r\nto combat the adverse impacts of climate change under \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, the Paris Agreement and other frameworks for \r\nthe resilient development of the Pacific region. The Boe \r\nDeclaration of the Pacific Island Forum leaders makes \r\nour position clear. We therefore strongly welcome \r\nthe Secretary-General’s climate summit to be held in \r\nSeptember 2019.\r\nIn February, Papua New Guinea experienced a \r\ntragic and unprecedented earthquake, the worst in our \r\nhistory. It hit five provinces, killed nearly 200 people \r\nand displaced nearly 600,000 others. Many others \r\nwere injured and traumatized. Vital infrastructure was \r\ndestroyed. The national economy slowed. Compounding \r\nour situation were two separate volcanic eruptions.\r\nWe are not alone. Accordingly, we sympathize \r\nwith other countries, such as Indonesia, Japan, the \r\nPhilippines, China, the United States of America, the \r\ncountries of the Caribbean and others that have been \r\naffected in recent times by months of natural disasters \r\nand climate-change-induced challenges. We express \r\nour gratitude to our bilateral partners, including the \r\nUnited Nations system, Australia, New Zealand, China, \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n6/53 18-30190\r\nJapan and others, as well as the private sector and civil \r\n-society groups, which stood with us in our time of \r\nneed. We are now revamping our economy and disaster-\r\nrelated plans to address similar events that may occur \r\nin the future.\r\nWe naturally welcome the efforts made to replenish \r\nthe financing available through the Green Climate \r\nFund and thank the contributors for their generosity. \r\nImproved and timely access is imperative, especially \r\nfor small island developing countries such as ours, in \r\norder to benefit from that important support to help us \r\nto mitigate, adapt and build resilience to the ravages \r\nof climate change and its adverse impacts and natural \r\ndisasters. Again, this is a call for collective global action \r\nthat all small island developing States will benefit from \r\nand seek accordingly.\r\nOur Government notes the international \r\ncommunity’s increasing interest in the imminent \r\nreferendum in June 2019 in Papua New Guinea’s \r\nAutonomous Region of Bougainville under the \r\nBougainville Peace Agreement. We are fully committed \r\nto the Agreement. This year, we appointed the former \r\nPrime Minister of Ireland, Mr. Bertie Ahern, to \r\npreside over the work of the Bougainville Referendum \r\nCommission. We are eager for the Commission to \r\nbegin its mandate soon. We are again grateful to \r\nour multilateral and bilateral development partners, \r\nincluding the United Nations, for working together with \r\nus on this issue of national importance for my country. \r\nHowever, we want to emphasize that the work done \r\nthrough partnerships should in no way undermine the \r\nsovereignty of Papua New Guinea over its territory, in \r\naccordance with international law.\r\nWe welcome the easing of tensions on the Korean \r\npeninsula, commend the efforts made by all parties \r\ninvolved, and further encourage peaceful dialogue. We \r\nsupport the moves to keep sanctions in place, not as a \r\npunishment but as a real incentive to get rid of nuclear \r\nweapons and fully implement all Security Council \r\nresolutions in order to bring prosperity to the people of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nAccordingly, we applaud and support the efforts of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly to draw global \r\nattention to the dangers of weapons of mass destruction. \r\nFor our part, we are working towards signing the Treaty \r\non the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to share the current \r\nstatus of the refugees and migrants on our Manus \r\nIsland with the General Assembly. The processing \r\ncentre was officially closed by my Government on \r\n31 October 2017, following the decision of the Supreme \r\nCourt in April 2016. We are therefore working closely \r\nwith Australia in resettling qualified asylum-seekers, \r\nincluding in the United States. Other migrants remain \r\nin our country, each of whom will be addressed on a \r\ncase-by-case basis. That is our contribution, within the \r\nlimit of our means, in partnership with Australia, to \r\naddressing human trafficking, people-smuggling and \r\ninternational crime.\r\nAs a maritime nation, Papua New Guinea considers \r\nthe oceans agenda to be of great importance, as it \r\ncontributes significantly to our nation’s well-being. \r\nWe are working to ensure equitable returns from our \r\nmarine resources, particularly by combating illegal, \r\nunregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing in Papua \r\nNew Guinea’s territorial waters. We are grateful for \r\nthe close cooperation of like-minded countries in the \r\nWorld Trade Organization that are working to address \r\nharmful fisheries subsidies that foster IUU fishing. At \r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum meeting, under our “Blue \r\nPacific Continent” theme, we have agreed to secure \r\nthe region’s maritime boundaries, work to eliminate \r\nmarine litter and enhance maritime surveillance so as \r\nto deter illicit activities.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention once again to our country as we prepare to \r\nhost the APEC leaders summit in November. As the \r\nworld increasingly turns its attention to the Pacific \r\nOcean, we are witnessing the enhanced interest of a \r\nrange of countries, such as Australia, China, France, \r\nNew Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United \r\nStates. As one of the nations of the Blue Pacific \r\nContinent, we welcome that interest. However, we urge \r\neveryone to play an appropriate role in accordance with \r\nthe accepted rules of international order so that the blue \r\nPacific Ocean will be a zone of cooperation, stability \r\nand security, and an environment of pristine beauty for \r\nfuture prosperity.\r\nI would therefore like to conclude by expressing the \r\nfervent hope of all our peoples that the Pacific Ocean \r\nforever lives up to the meaning of its name — the ocean \r\nof peace.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdallah, Minister \r\nResponsible for Foreign Affairs of the Sultanate \r\nof Oman.\r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 7/53\r\nMr. Abdallah (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to extend our congratulations to \r\nyou, Madam President, and your friendly nation on \r\nyour election to preside over the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-third session. I assure you, Madam, of the \r\ndelegation of the Sultanate of Oman’s cooperation as \r\nyou guide the Assembly to success in this session.\r\nWe also express our appreciation to the President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, \r\nHis Excellency Miroslav Lajčák, for the way in which \r\nhe steered the Assembly’s work and for the decisions \r\nthat were taken under his leadership. We also take \r\nthis opportunity to fully commend Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres for his efforts to strengthen the role \r\nof the Organization and reform its mechanisms in order \r\nto better achieve the purposes and principles set forth \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe work of the United Nations must focus on \r\naddressing challenges, settling international disputes \r\nand conflicts, and achieving peace. Given that my \r\ncountry believes that dialogue and negotiation are the \r\nbest means to resolve differences, we emphasize that \r\nthe Sultanate of Oman will spare no effort in supporting \r\ninitiatives that lead to peace, security and stability in \r\nthe Middle East and throughout the world. We consider \r\npeace to be the main building block for stability and \r\ndevelopment. Accordingly, we hope that Member States \r\nwill collaborate in ways that are consistent with the \r\nprinciples of good-neighbourliness, respect for national \r\nsovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof other States.\r\nThe Palestinian question is the central issue in \r\nthe Middle East. The international community’s \r\ncooperation in creating an environment conducive \r\nto the parties concerned ending the conflict is an \r\nurgent strategic necessity. We believe that, despite the \r\ndifficulties in the current situation and the impasse in \r\nthe dialogue, an environment favourable to fruitful \r\ndiscussions between the Palestinian and Israeli parties \r\nthat might lead to a comprehensive settlement based \r\non the two-State solution would be more welcome than \r\never, especially since the absence of a Palestinian State \r\nwill only perpetuate violence and terrorism.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman is willing to make every \r\neffort to restore a climate of optimism so that a \r\ncomprehensive agreement can be reached and a future of \r\npeaceful coexistence between the Palestinians and the \r\nIsraelis built. The creation of a peaceful environment \r\nbetween the Palestinian and Israeli parties is essential \r\nto establishing peace in the Middle East region as \r\na whole.\r\nWe also call on the countries of the world, \r\nparticularly the United States of America — which \r\nplays an essential role in achieving peace and stability \r\nin the world — to consider all available opportunities \r\nto support peace efforts and to facilitate the work of \r\ninternational organizations. We must not allow peace \r\nto be sacrificed.\r\nThe suffering of the Republic of Yemen can be seen \r\nin the tragic economic and humanitarian situation in the \r\ncountry, which stems from the collapse of infrastructure \r\nin the health, education and economy sectors and the \r\nloss of other basic services that affect the daily lives \r\nof citizens in Yemen, as well as the spread of disease, \r\ninadequate medical treatment and a lack of medicines. \r\nThat tragic situation demands that we all redouble our \r\nefforts to help Yemen.\r\nThe international community must implement a \r\nproject that would allow the Yemeni people in various \r\nprovinces to gain access to humanitarian aid, while \r\nfacilitating the use of airports and seaports to that \r\nend. Indeed, the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen \r\nrequires that such measures, at a minimum, be taken. \r\nAccordingly, my country welcomes the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations and the Arab coalition countries to \r\nestablish a humanitarian medical airlift for patients \r\nsuffering from critical conditions so that they can \r\nreceive proper medical treatment. Those scheduled \r\nf lights are being supervised by the United Nations in \r\ncollaboration with the Yemeni parties.\r\nMy country also underscores its support for the \r\nefforts of Special Envoy Martin Griffiths. We call \r\nfor further efforts to be made to support his mission, \r\nin particular to enable the holding of meetings and \r\nconsultations with all Yemeni parties and the provision \r\nof transportation of the parties so that they can \r\nparticipate in such meetings. We believe that a political \r\nsolution should be based on the reality on the ground in \r\nYemen and that all Yemeni parties and political entities \r\nin the country and abroad should be given a chance to \r\nparticipate in planning a bright future for their country.\r\nAs we are deeply affected by the humanitarian \r\nsuffering of the Yemeni people, we would like to \r\nemphasize that the Sultanate of Oman will continue \r\nto provide facilities and humanitarian assistance to \r\nthe brotherly Yemeni people, and that the land, sea \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n8/53 18-30190\r\nand air outlets between the Sultanate of Oman and the \r\nRepublic of Yemen, which are the only available means \r\nfor Yemenis to interact with the outside world, will \r\nremain open, based on the principles of brotherhood \r\nand good-neighbourliness and the deep historical and \r\nsocial ties linking our peoples.\r\nWe commend the Special Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, for his efforts \r\nto help the Syrian parties develop a constitutional \r\nfoundation for the country and build on the positive \r\noutcomes of the talks in Geneva, Astana and Sochi \r\nso as to stop the war, achieve national reconciliation \r\nand end the conflict. We hope that the joint efforts and \r\ncooperation that we are now seeing in Syria and other \r\nplaces of conflict will continue.\r\nMy country welcomes the positive developments \r\nin the Horn of Africa and the understandings reached \r\nby States in the region. They should result in restoring \r\nconfidence and ending disputes. We welcome the \r\nefforts of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and \r\nthe key role played by his country in helping to achieve \r\nsecurity and stability in the Horn of Africa region.\r\nIn conclusion, my country renews its call on all \r\ncountries of the world to adhere to the principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international \r\nlaw and resolve their differences by peaceful means, \r\nthat is, without resorting to war, in the light of war’s \r\ntragic consequences, so as to ensure that the peoples \r\nof the world can enjoy security, stability, development \r\nand prosperity.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Sushma Swaraj, Minister for External Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of India.\r\nMs. Swaraj (India) (spoke in Hindi; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): On my own behalf and on \r\nbehalf of my country, India, I should like to begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Madam President, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session. As a woman, I feel doubly proud that \r\nthis honour has been bestowed on you. I also recall, \r\nwith equal pride, that the first woman to occupy this \r\neminent position was an Indian — Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi \r\nPandit — in 1953, at the General Assembly at its eight \r\nsession. I also thank former President Miroslav Lajčák \r\nfor successfully presiding over the seventy-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nWe received the tragic news this morning \r\nof a tsunami and an earthquake, which occurred \r\nsimultaneously. From this rostrum, on behalf of India, I \r\nwish to convey our deep condolences to the Government \r\nand the people of Indonesia. I would also like to assure \r\nthem that India will cooperate in helping them during \r\nthis trying time.\r\nThe United Nations is the world’s principal \r\nmultilateral organization, where nations seek balm \r\nfor the wounds of history and a platform for solutions \r\nand where less developed nations sit with their more \r\nfortunate brethren to formulate plans that can correct \r\nskewed economic imbalances. In 2015, we established \r\n2030 as a critically important horizon for 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). A common refrain since \r\n2015 has been that we will reach that horizon only if \r\nIndia finds its way to that destination; otherwise, we \r\nwill fail.\r\nI assure the General Assembly through you, \r\nMadam President, that India will not let us fail. We are \r\ntotally committed to achieving those objectives for our \r\nown people. Under the leadership of Prime Minister \r\nNarendra Modi, India has initiated an unprecedented \r\neconomic and social transformation that will help our \r\ncountry achieve its SDG benchmarks well before the \r\ndeadline. I will provide an overview to illustrate the \r\nworld’s largest-scale exercise in poverty elimination \r\nand social transformation.\r\nThrough the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, \r\nthe world’s largest financial inclusion scheme, more \r\nthan 320 million Indians who had previously never \r\nseen the inside of a bank now have bank accounts. \r\nThe programme has enabled the poor to receive direct \r\nbenefit transfers from the Government’s welfare \r\nprogrammes into their personal accounts, thereby \r\nstopping waste and corruption within the system. \r\nSimilarly, Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the world’s largest \r\nhealth insurance programme, was launched by Prime \r\nMinister Modi a few days ago, on 23 September. That \r\nrevolutionary scheme will benefit 500 million Indians, \r\nwho will receive insurance coverage of 500,000 rupees \r\nper family annually. We have a prayer in India — Sarve \r\nSantu Niramaya — which means “May all be free \r\nfrom illness”. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana, or National \r\nHealth Protection Scheme, is the answer to that prayer.\r\nSimilarly, we have launched the largest-scale \r\nhousing programme in the world aimed at ensuring \r\nthat everyone has a roof over their head. Under the \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 9/53\r\nprogramme, we have set for ourselves a target of \r\nnearly 21 million homes by 2022. So far, more than \r\n5 million homes for the poor have already been built. \r\nTwo extremely effective programmes have also been \r\ninitiated to increase the skill levels of those waiting to \r\nbe employed through the National Skill Development \r\nCorporation and the Micro Units Development and \r\nRefinance Agency (MUDRA) programme, which seeks \r\nto turn the poor into entrepreneurs. I stress that more \r\nthan 140 million Indians have taken out MUDRA loans. \r\nThe most significant aspect of the MUDRA scheme is \r\nthe fact that 76 per cent of its beneficiaries are women. \r\nAt the heart of Prime Minister Modi’s transformative \r\nvision is a radical idea, which is that uplifting any \r\nnation is best achieved through the comprehensive \r\nempowerment of women. All the programmes that I \r\nhave just mentioned have the welfare of women at their \r\ncore. Last year, I spoke about the Ujjwala programme \r\n(see A/72/PV.19), through which, I am happy to report, \r\n50 million free liquid-gas connections have been \r\nprovided so far.\r\nAnother such initiative is the maternity benefit \r\nprogramme, in which women in India are provided \r\nwith 26 weeks of paid leave to care for their newborns. \r\nAs a woman, Madam President, you will understand \r\nbetter than most how vitally important that programme \r\nis for every mother. Some developed nations with huge \r\neconomies do not provide more than six weeks’ paid \r\nleave, thereby leading to a continuing struggle for \r\nmore time off. In India, we have implemented what \r\nwomen across the world need, namely, 26 weeks of paid \r\nmaternity leave.\r\nIn 2022, free India will be 75 years old. Prime \r\nMinister Narendra Modi has pledged to build a New \r\nIndia by then. What kind of India will that be? That \r\nIndia will be a clean, healthy, prosperous, secure, \r\neducated, developed, energized and strong India. That \r\nis our horizon for India in 2022, and we will reach it, as \r\nwe are sparing no effort to meet that goal.\r\nThe greatest challenges of our era are the existential \r\nthreats of climate change and terrorism. Underdeveloped \r\nand developing nations are the most affected victims \r\nof climate change. They have neither the capacity nor \r\nthe resources to meet that crisis. The countries that \r\nhave exploited nature for their short-term needs cannot \r\nabdicate their responsibilities in that matter. If we wish \r\nto save the world from the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange, the developed nations must lift up the deprived \r\nwith financial and technical resources. The principle \r\nof common but differentiated responsibilities and \r\nrespective capabilities was reiterated in the 2015 Paris \r\nAgreement. Prime Minister Modi, together with the \r\nPrime Minister of France, launched the International \r\nSolar Alliance. Sixty-eight nations have become \r\nmembers of the Alliance so far. In March, India and \r\nFrance chaired the founding conference of the Alliance, \r\nin which 120 countries participated. I am pleased to \r\ninform the Assembly that Prime Minister Modi has \r\nbeen acknowledged as a champion in that area. He is \r\nalso working towards realizing the principle of one \r\nsun, one grid, since he believes that, as there is only \r\none sun, there should also be a single universal grid. \r\nIf that goal is achieved, we will be witness to a major \r\nrevolution in the energy sector, which will represent a \r\nmajor milestone in combating all phenomena related to \r\nclimate change.\r\nI mentioned terrorism as the second existential \r\nthreat to humankind. We imagined that the advent of the \r\ntwenty-first century would see an age of common good \r\ncharacterized by cooperation but, here in New York, \r\nthe horrific tragedy of 11 September and, in Mumbai, \r\nthe catastrophe of 26 November became nightmares \r\nthat shattered our dreams. The demon of terrorism \r\nnow stalks the world at a faster pace in some places, \r\nand at a slower one in others, but it is life-threatening \r\neverywhere. In our case, terrorism is bred not in some \r\nfaraway land but across our border to the west. Our \r\nneighbour’s expertise is not restricted to serving as a \r\nspawning ground for terrorism; our neighbour is also \r\nan expert in trying to mask malevolence with verbal \r\nduplicity. The most startling evidence of that duplicity \r\nwas the fact that Osama Bin Laden, the architect and \r\nideologue of 11 September, was given safe haven \r\nin Pakistan.\r\nAmerica had declared Osama Bin Laden to \r\nbe its most dangerous enemy and had launched an \r\nexhaustive, worldwide search to bring him to justice. \r\nWhat America could perhaps not comprehend was that \r\nOsama would find sanctuary in a country that claimed \r\nto be America’s friend and ally, namely, Pakistan. \r\nEventually, America’s intelligence services discovered \r\nthe truth of that hypocrisy, and its special forces \r\ndelivered justice. But Pakistan continued to behave as \r\nif nothing had happened. Pakistan’s commitment to \r\nterrorism as an instrument of official policy has not \r\nabated one bit, nor has its practice of hypocrisy. The \r\nkillers of 11 September met their fate but the mastermind \r\nof 26 November, Hafiz Saeed, continues to roam the \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n10/53 18-30190\r\nstreets of Pakistan with impunity. What is heartening is \r\nthat the world is no longer ready to believe Islamabad. \r\nThe Financial Action Task Force, for instance, has put \r\nPakistan on notice with regard to the funding of terror.\r\nWe have been accused of sabotaging the process for \r\ntalks with Pakistan. That is a complete lie. We believe \r\nthat talks are the only rational means by which to settle \r\neven the most complex disputes. Accordingly, talks \r\nwith Pakistan have been initiated many times. When \r\nthey failed, it was only because of Pakistan’s behaviour. \r\nThere have been many Governments of numerous \r\nparties in India. Every Government has tried the peace \r\noption. By inviting the Heads of State of the South \r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation to his \r\nswearing-in ceremony, Prime Minister Modi began his \r\nattempt for dialogue on his very first day in office. On \r\n9 December 2016, I personally went to Islamabad and \r\nproposed a comprehensive bilateral dialogue. But soon \r\nafterwards, on 2 January, Pakistan-sponsored terrorists \r\nattacked our air force base in Pathankot. It is clear that \r\nwe could not pursue talks in the middle of terrorist \r\nbloodshed. Even now, after the new Government in \r\nPakistan came to power, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, \r\nImran Khan, wrote to Prime Minister Modi suggesting \r\na meeting between our Foreign Ministers in New York. \r\nWe even accepted the proposal but, within hours of our \r\nacceptance, news came that terrorists had killed three \r\nof our security personnel. Does that indicate a desire \r\nfor dialogue? Could such a dialogue ever take place?\r\nTime and again, Pakistan has accused India of \r\nhuman rights violations. Who is a greater transgressor \r\nof human rights than a terrorist? Those who take \r\ninnocent lives in pursuit of war by other means are \r\ndefenders of inhuman behaviour, not of human rights. \r\nPakistan glorifies killers. It refuses to see the blood of \r\ninnocent victims. It has become something of a habit \r\nfor Pakistan to throw the dust of deceit and deception \r\nup against India in order to provide some thin cover for \r\nits own guilt.\r\nThe United Nations has seen that before. Last year, \r\nusing her right of reply, the representative of Pakistan \r\ndisplayed some photographs as proof of alleged human \r\nrights violations by India (see A/72/PV.22). The \r\nphotographs turned out to be from another country. \r\nSimilar false accusations have become part of its \r\nstandard rhetoric.\r\nEach year, for the past five years, India has been \r\narguing from this rostrum that lists are not enough if we \r\nwant to check terrorists and their protectors. We need \r\nto bring them to accountability through international \r\nlaw. In 1996, India submitted a document with a draft \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism at \r\nthe United Nations. That draft remains a draft today \r\nonly because we cannot agree on a common language. \r\nOn the one hand, we want to fight terrorism; on the \r\nother, we cannot define it.\r\nThat has allowed terrorists with a price on their \r\nhead to be celebrated in Pakistan as “freedom fighters”. \r\nTheir cruelty and barbarism are being advertised as \r\nheroism. The country of Pakistan prints postage stamps \r\nglorifying such terrorists. How long can we sit quietly \r\nand listen to such claims? If we do not act now, we will \r\nhave to deal with that demon later on, when it sets fire \r\nto the entire world. Once again, I appeal to this body \r\nto come to an agreement on the draft comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism and to adopt it as \r\none of the necessary measures in a long-running war.\r\nI would now like to make some remarks regarding \r\nthe United Nations. I began by highlighting its unique \r\nand positive role, but I must add that, step by slow \r\nstep, the importance, influence, respect for and value \r\nof this institution are beginning to ebb. It is time to \r\nwonder whether we are wandering towards the fate of \r\nthe League of Nations, which came to an end because \r\nit did not adopt the changes that were needed. It was \r\nunwilling to accept the need for reforms; we must not \r\nmake that mistake. The United Nations must accept that \r\nit needs fundamental reform. Those reforms cannot be \r\nsimply cosmetic; we need to change the institution’s \r\nhead and heart in order to make both compatible with \r\nthe contemporary reality.\r\nReform must begin today; tomorrow could be too \r\nlate. Are all of the challenges that confronted the United \r\nNations at its founding still relevant today? I feel that, \r\nin the Security Council, now is the time to start making \r\nmuch-needed changes.\r\nA subject that is often debated is multilateralism. \r\nThe challenges we face are causing tensions in many \r\ncountries. I should like to state that India believes that \r\nthe world is one global family. The United Nations \r\nshould therefore work as a family. How does a family \r\nwork? It is shaped by love, not trade; it is nurtured by \r\ncompassion, not jealousy; it functions by compromising, \r\nnot by fighting. That is why the United Nations must \r\nbe based on the principles of the family. It cannot be \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 11/53\r\nrun using “I”, “me” and “mine”; this forum needs “we”, \r\n“us” and “ours”. Only then will it be sustainable.\r\nIndia does not believe that only certain countries \r\nshould be allowed to fulfil their goal or that we should \r\ntake decisions on behalf of other countries that are not \r\nbeneficial to them. We should take every country’s \r\ngoals into account.\r\nThis year, India will celebrate the 150th \r\nanniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth. Mahatma’s \r\nfavourite devotional hymn was “Vaishnav Jan To Tene \r\nKahiye” or “Call those people Vaishnavas who feel the \r\npain of others”. Its essence is that he who understands \r\nthe pain of another and absorbs it as his own is a good \r\nhuman being. He who sees that pain and helps without \r\nbecoming arrogant is a good human being.\r\nWe have to make the Assembly a platform for \r\nunderstanding, assistance and true justice. We have \r\nto understand the pain of other nations and work with \r\ndeveloped nations to ease and eliminate their pain. \r\nArrogance has no place in our scheme of things; \r\narrogance is counter-productive and self-defeating. \r\nLet us work for the benefit of the less fortunate and \r\ntowards a world that is free from terrorism, tension and \r\nviolence. That is the universe we envisage.\r\nIt is with that wish in mind that I end with a Sanskrit \r\nshloka or song: May all experience well-being; may all \r\nexperience peace; may all move towards perfection; \r\nmay all enjoy prosperity; may all achieve serenity.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Walid Al-Moualem, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Al-Moualem (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): I would like to congratulate you, Madam \r\nPresident, and your country, Ecuador, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session. I wish you every success. I would also \r\nlike to thank your predecessor for his role in steering \r\nthe work of the Assembly during the previous session. \r\nI thank as well the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations for his efforts pursuant to the Charter.\r\nEvery year we come to this important international \r\nforum carrying hopes and wishes that every place in \r\nthis world will have become more secure, stable and \r\nprosperous. Today, our hope is greater than ever, as we \r\nare confident that the will of the people will eventually \r\ntriumph. Our hope and confidence are the result of more \r\nthan seven years of hardship during which our people \r\nhave suffered from the scourge of terrorism. However, \r\nSyrians have refused to compromise and succumb to \r\nterrorist groups and their external supporters. They \r\nhave stood their ground and remained defiant, fully \r\nconvinced that their struggle is a battle for their \r\nexistence, their history and their future, from which \r\nthey will ultimately emerge victorious.\r\nTo the disappointment of some, we are here today, \r\nmore than seven years into the dirty war against my \r\ncountry, to announce to the world that the situation on \r\nthe ground has become more secure and stable, and \r\nthat our battle against terrorism is almost over. That \r\nis true thanks to the heroism, resolve and unity of the \r\nSyrian people and the army, and to the support of our \r\nallies and friends. Despite those achievements, we are \r\ndetermined to continue the sacred battle until we purge \r\nall Syrian territories of terrorist groups, regardless of \r\ntheir names, and any illegal foreign presence. We will \r\npay no heed to any aggression or external pressure on \r\nus, or to any lies or allegations that seek to discourage \r\nus. That is our duty and a non-negotiable right that we \r\nhave exercised as we eradicated terrorism from most of \r\nthe Syrian territories.\r\nThe Governments of certain countries have denied \r\nus our right under international law and our national \r\nduty to combat terrorism and protect our people on \r\nour land and within our own borders. At the same \r\ntime, those Governments have founded an illegitimate \r\ninternational coalition led by the United States under \r\nthe pretext of combating terrorism in Syria. However, \r\nthat coalition has done everything but fight terrorism. \r\nIt has even proved that the coalition’s goals were in \r\nline with those of terrorist groups, namely, spreading \r\nchaos, killing and destruction. The coalition destroyed \r\nthe Syrian city of Raqqa, destroyed infrastructure \r\nand public services in targeted areas and massacred \r\ncivilians, including children and women, all of which \r\nconstitute war crimes under international law.\r\nOn the other hand, the coalition has provided direct \r\nmilitary support to terrorists on multiple occasions as \r\nthey fought against the Syrian army. It should have been \r\nmore aptly named the coalition to support terrorists and \r\ncommit war crimes.\r\nThe situation and its dimensions in Syria cannot \r\nbe divorced from the conflict raging between two \r\naxes on the world stage. One axis promotes peace, \r\nstability and prosperity across the world, advocates \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n12/53 18-30190\r\nfor a culture of dialogue and mutual understanding, \r\nrespects international law and upholds the principle of \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States. \r\nThe other axis tries to spread chaos in international \r\nrelations and insists on employing colonization and \r\nhegemony as tools to further its narrow interests, \r\neven if that means resorting to dirty methods such as \r\nsupporting terrorism and imposing economic blockades \r\nin order to subjugate peoples and Governments that \r\nreject external dictates and insist on making their own \r\nindependent national decisions.\r\nWhat happened in Syria should have been a lesson \r\nto those countries, but they refuse to learn. That is \r\nwhy we, the Members of this Organization, must make \r\nclear and unequivocal choices. Are we going to defend \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand be on the side of justice? Or are we going to succumb \r\nto hegemonic tendencies and the law of the jungle that \r\nsome are trying to impose on this Organization and the \r\nworld?\r\nToday, the situation on the ground is more stable \r\nand secure thanks to the progress made in combating \r\nterrorism. The Syrian Government continues to \r\nrehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists and \r\nrestore normal life. All conditions are now present for \r\nthe voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country \r\nthat they had to leave because of terrorism and the \r\nunilateral economic measures that targeted their daily \r\nlives and their livelihoods. It is true that thousands of \r\nSyrian refugees living abroad have started to return \r\nhome. From this rostrum, I would like to stress that the \r\nreturn of each and every Syrian refugee is a priority for \r\nthe Syrian State. Doors are wide open for all Syrians \r\nabroad to return voluntarily and safely. I underline that \r\nwhat applies to Syrians inside Syria also applies to \r\nSyrians abroad. Everyone is under the law.\r\nThanks to the help from the Government of the \r\nRussian Federation, the Syrian Government will spare \r\nno effort to facilitate the return of those refugees and \r\nmeet their basic needs. Therefore, a special coordination \r\nbody has been established to coordinate the return \r\nof refugees to their places of origin in Syria and to \r\nenable them to rebuild their normal lives. Although \r\nwe have called upon the international community and \r\nhumanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of \r\nrefugees, some Western countries — as a complement \r\nto the dirty role they have played since the start of \r\nthe war in Syria — continue to obstruct the return \r\nof those Syrian refugees to their country. They are \r\nspreading fears among refugees under false pretexts \r\nand politicizing that purely humanitarian issue, using it \r\nas a bargaining chip to serve their political agenda and \r\nlinking the return of refugees to the political process.\r\nToday, as we are about to close the last chapter of the \r\nSyrian crisis, Syrians are determined to come together, \r\nerase the traces of that terrorist war and rebuild their \r\ncountry with their own hands and experience. That \r\napplies to those who stayed in Syria and to those who \r\nwere forced to leave as a result of terrorist acts. We \r\nwelcome all of the initiatives of States and parties that \r\ndid not engage in the aggression against Syria and \r\nwere clear and explicit in rejecting terrorism to help \r\nthe Syrian Government in the reconstruction process. \r\nWe underscore once again that the friendly countries \r\nthat stood by our side against terrorism have priority \r\nin participating in the reconstruction programmes. As \r\nfor the countries that offer only conditional assistance \r\nto engage in the reconstruction process or continue to \r\nsupport terrorism, they are basically neither invited nor \r\nwelcome.\r\nIn parallel with achieving progress against \r\nterrorism, as well as in reconstruction and the return of \r\nrefugees, we are keen to advance the political process \r\nwhile maintaining our constant principles, namely, to \r\npreserve the sovereignty, independence and unity of the \r\nterritory and people of the Syrian Arab Republic. The \r\nSyrian people have the exclusive right to determine the \r\nfuture of their country without any external interference \r\nand free of terrorism in the Syrian territories.\r\nBased on those constant principles, we have \r\nexpressed time and again our readiness to respond to \r\nany initiative that could help Syrians to end the crisis. \r\nWe have engaged positively and openly in the Geneva \r\ntalks, the Astana process and the intra-Syrian national \r\ndialogue in Sochi. However, it has always been the \r\nother parties that have set obstacles, rejected dialogue \r\nand resorted to terrorism and foreign interference.\r\nNevertheless, we continue to adopt a positive \r\nattitude towards the outcomes of the Syrian national \r\ndialogue in Sochi on the formation of a committee to \r\nreview the current constitution. We have presented a \r\npractical and comprehensive vision on the composition, \r\nprerogatives and working methods of that committee, \r\nand submitted a list of representatives on behalf of \r\nthe Syrian State. We stress that the mandate of the \r\ncommittee is limited to reviewing the articles of the \r\ncurrent Constitution through a Syrian-led and Syrian-\r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 13/53\r\nowned process that may be facilitated by the Special \r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General for Syria.\r\nMr. Bahr Aluloom (Iraq), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nWe also stress that no preconditions or foregone \r\nconclusions should be imposed on the committee \r\nand its recommendations. The committee must be \r\nindependent, given that the Constitution and anything \r\nrelating to it is a Syrian matter to be decided by \r\nSyrians themselves. We will not, therefore, accept any \r\nproposal that constitutes interference in the internal \r\naffairs of Syria or might lead to such interference. \r\nWe underscore that the Syrian people must have the \r\nfinal word regarding any constitutional or other matter \r\nrelating to sovereignty. We also reaffirm our readiness \r\nto work actively with countries friendly to the Syrian \r\nGovernment to launch the work of the committee along \r\nthe bases and parameters that I have just mentioned.\r\nIn conjunction with the international initiatives that \r\nI have referred to, local national reconciliation is well \r\nunder way. Reconciliation agreements have stopped the \r\nbloodshed and prevented destruction in many Syrian \r\nareas. They have restored stability and normal life to \r\nthose areas, allowing their people to return to the homes \r\nthat they were forced to leave because of terrorism. \r\nReconciliation will therefore remain our priority and \r\nour focus.\r\nThe battle we have fought in Syria against terrorism \r\nhas not only been a military one; it has also been a battle \r\nbetween the culture of destruction, extremism and \r\ndeath and the culture of construction, tolerance and life. \r\nI therefore appeal from this rostrum to the international \r\ncommunity to fight the ideology of terrorism and \r\nviolent extremism and prevent it from getting support \r\nand financial resources, and to implement the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, notably resolution 2253 \r\n(2015). The military battle against terrorism, while \r\nimportant, is not enough. Terrorism is like an epidemic: \r\nit will return, break out and threaten everyone without \r\nexception.\r\nWe fully condemn and reject the use of chemical \r\nweapons under any circumstances, wherever or \r\nwhenever it occurs and regardless of the target. That \r\nis why Syria completely eliminated its chemical \r\nprogramme and fulfilled all its commitments to the \r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \r\n(OPCW), as confirmed by numerous OPCW reports.\r\nAlthough some Western countries are constantly \r\ntrying to politicize that organization’s work, we have \r\nalways cooperated with the OPCW to the fullest \r\nextent possible. Unfortunately, every time we express \r\nour readiness to receive objective and professional \r\ninvestigative teams to investigate the alleged use of \r\nchemical weapons, those countries have blocked such \r\nefforts because they know that the conclusions of the \r\ninvestigations would not satisfy them given the ill \r\nintentions they harbour against Syria. Those countries \r\nhave ready-made accusations and scenarios to justify \r\naggression against Syria. That was the case when the \r\nUnited States, France and Britain launched a wanton \r\ntripartite aggression on Syria last April, claiming that \r\nchemical weapons had been used, but without any \r\ninvestigation or evidence and in f lagrant violation of \r\nSyria’s sovereignty, international law and the Charter \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nMeanwhile, those same countries have disregarded \r\nall of the reliable information that we have provided \r\non chemical weapons in the possession of terrorist \r\ngroups that were used by them on multiple occasions \r\nwith a view to casting blame on the Syrian Government \r\nand justifying a predetermined attack against it. The \r\nterrorist organization known as the White Helmets was \r\nthe main tool used to mislead public opinion, fabricate \r\naccusations and come up with lies regarding the use \r\nof chemical weapons in Syria. The White Helmets \r\norganization was created by British intelligence under \r\na humanitarian cover. It has been proved, however, that \r\nthat organization is part of the Al-Nusra Front, which is \r\naffiliated with Al-Qaida. Despite all those allegations, \r\nwe remain determined to liberate every inch of our \r\nterritory without concern for the black banners of \r\nterrorists or the theatrics of the White Helmets.\r\nIn another episode of the terrorist war on Syria since \r\n2011, brutal suicide bombings in July orchestrated by \r\nDa’esh rocked the province of Al-Suwayda in southern \r\nSyria. It is worth noting that the terrorists behind that \r\nattack came from the Al-Tanf area, where United States \r\nforces are present. That area has become a safe haven for \r\nremnant groups of Da’esh gunmen, who are now hiding \r\nin the Rukban refugee camp on the border with Jordan \r\nunder the protection and sponsorship of United States \r\nforces present in the area. In line with its investment in \r\nterrorism aimed at prolonging the crisis in Syria, the \r\nUnited States has also sought to release terrorists from \r\nGuantanamo prison and send them to Syria, where they \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n14/53 18-30190\r\nhave become the effective leaders of the Al-Nusra Front \r\nand other terrorist groups.\r\nMeanwhile, the Turkish regime continues to \r\nsupport terrorists in Syria. Since day one of the war \r\non Syria, the Turkish regime has trained and armed \r\nterrorists, turning Turkey into a hub and a corridor for \r\nterrorists on their way to Syria. When those terrorists \r\nfailed to serve its agenda, the Turkish regime resorted \r\nto direct aggression by attacking many cities and towns \r\nin northern Syria. However, all actions that seek to \r\nundermine Syria’s sovereignty, unity and territorial \r\nintegrity and that violate international law will not stop \r\nus from exercising our right and duty to recover all our \r\nland and purge it of terrorists, whether through military \r\naction or local reconciliation agreements.\r\nBased on the aforementioned, we have always \r\nwelcomed any initiative that prevents further Syrian \r\nbloodshed and restores security and safety to areas \r\naffected by terrorism. That is why we welcomed the \r\nagreement on Idlib reached in Sochi on 17 September. \r\nThat agreement was the result of intensive consultations \r\nand full coordination between Syria and Russia. \r\nWe underscore that that agreement is time-bound \r\nand includes specific deadlines. It complements the \r\nagreements previously reached in Astana on the \r\nde-escalation zones. We hope that, when the agreement \r\nis implemented, the Al-Nusra Front and other terrorist \r\ngroups will be eradicated, thereby eliminating the last \r\nremnants of terrorism on the Syrian territories.\r\nAny foreign presence on Syrian territories without \r\nthe consent of the Syrian Government is illegal and \r\nconstitutes a f lagrant violation of international law and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. It is an assault on our \r\nnational sovereignty and undermines counter-terrorism \r\nefforts and threatens regional peace and security. \r\nWe therefore consider that any forces operating on \r\nSyrian territories without a request from the Syrian \r\nGovernment — including United States, French \r\nand Turkish forces — are occupying forces, which \r\nwill be dealt with accordingly. They must withdraw \r\nimmediately and unconditionally.\r\nIsrael continues to occupy a cherished part of our \r\nland in the Syrian Golan, and our people there continue \r\nto suffer because of Israel’s oppressive and aggressive \r\npolicies. Israel has even supported terrorist groups \r\nthat have operated in southern Syria, protecting them \r\nthrough direct military intervention and launching \r\nrepeated attacks on Syrian land. However, just as \r\nwe liberated southern Syria from terrorists, we are \r\ndetermined to fully restore the occupied Syrian Golan \r\nalong the lines of 4 June 1967. Syria demands that the \r\ninternational community effectively put an end to all \r\nsuch Israeli practices and compel Israel to implement \r\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions, notably \r\nresolution 497 (1981), on the occupied Syrian Golan.\r\nThe international community must also help the \r\nPalestinian people to establish their own independent \r\nState, with Jerusalem as its capital, and facilitate the \r\nreturn of Palestinian refugees to their land, pursuant \r\nto resolutions of international legitimacy. Any actions \r\nthat undermine those rights are null and void and can \r\nonly be rejected, as they threaten regional peace and \r\nsecurity, especially the racist Israeli law known as \r\nthe Nation-State Law and the decision of the United \r\nStates Administration to move the American embassy \r\nto Jerusalem and to stop funding the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East.\r\nSyria strongly condemns the decision of the United \r\nStates Administration to withdraw from the nuclear \r\nagreement with Iran, which proves once again that \r\nAdministration’s disregard for and non-commitment \r\nto international treaties and conventions. We reiterate \r\nour full solidarity with the leaders and the people of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, and trust that they will \r\novercome the effects of that irresponsible decision on \r\nthe part of the United States Administration.\r\nIn the same context, we also stand with the \r\nGovernment and the people of Venezuela against the \r\nattempts by the United States to interfere in their \r\ninternal affairs. We call once again for the lifting of the \r\nunilateral economic measures imposed on the Syrian \r\npeople and all other independent peoples around the \r\nworld, especially those of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, Cuba and Belarus.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like everyone to know that \r\nSyria, with the help of its allies and friends, will defeat \r\nterrorism. We must be treated accordingly. It is high \r\ntime for some people to detach themselves from their \r\nstate of separation from reality, abandon their illusions \r\nand come to understand that they will not achieve \r\npolitically what they failed to achieve by war. We have \r\nnever compromised on our national principles, even \r\nwhen the war was at its peak. We will surely not do so \r\ntoday.\r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 15/53\r\nAt the same time, we want peace for the peoples of the \r\nworld — that is the message we are sending — because \r\nwe want peace for our people. We have never attacked \r\nothers; we have never interfered in the affairs of others; \r\nand we have never exported terrorism to other parts \r\nof the world. We have always maintained the best \r\nrelations with other countries. Today, as we seek to \r\ndefeat terrorism, we continue to advocate dialogue and \r\nunderstanding, which serves the interests of our people \r\nand helps to achieve security, stability and prosperity \r\nfor all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Ri Yong Ho, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea.\r\nMr. Ri Yong Ho (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea) (spoke in Korean; English text provided by \r\nthe delegation): First of all, allow me to congratulate \r\nHer Excellency Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés \r\non her election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-third session. I look forward to a successful \r\noutcome of the session under her able stewardship.\r\nPeace and development is the common desire of our \r\ntimes and constitutes the main objective of the United \r\nNations, defining all of its activities. Many countries \r\naround the world concentrate their efforts on achieving \r\npeace and development, but such efforts are still faced \r\nwith serious challenges. During the past year, we have \r\nwitnessed greater tension in overall international \r\nrelations, with peace being threatened and development \r\nbeing deterred in many parts of the world owing to the \r\n“power does it all” attitude of unilateralism. Such a \r\nsituation requires that the role of the United Nations be \r\neven further enhanced.\r\nIt is on the Korean peninsula that the most tangible \r\ntrend towards peace and development was newly created \r\nthis year. In April, Comrade Kim Jong Un, Chairman \r\nof the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, put forward a new strategic \r\nline of concentrating all efforts on socialist economic \r\nconstruction.\r\nSince we have sufficiently consolidated our \r\nnational defence capabilities and war deterrence so as \r\nto cope with the several-decades-long nuclear threats \r\nagainst the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, we \r\nnow must concentrate all of our efforts on the historic \r\ntask of building the economy. Our Government’s policy \r\nline of focusing on the economy requires a peaceful \r\nenvironment above all else.\r\nComrade Chairman Kim Jong Un has actively \r\nparticipated in summit-level diplomatic activities with \r\na firm determination to turn the Korean peninsula \r\ninto a land of peace, free of both nuclear weapons \r\nand nuclear threats. He thereby made an important \r\nbreakthrough in improving North-South relations and \r\nrelations between the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea and the United States, as well as in revitalizing \r\nfriendly and cooperative relations with neighbouring \r\ncountries, thus marking a turning point and a dramatic \r\neasing of tensions on the Korean peninsula and the \r\nregion as whole. Peace and security in the region will be \r\nconsolidated and that, in turn, will lead to world peace \r\nand security — to the benefit of all States Members of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe fact that representatives of numerous countries \r\nhave been unanimous in supporting and welcoming, \r\nfrom this rostrum, the current direction of developments \r\non the Korean peninsula clearly shows that the \r\nGovernment of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea’s strategic choice and its sincere efforts to pursue \r\nthat choice are fully aligned with the common interests \r\nand desires of the international community.\r\nThe key to consolidating peace and security on \r\nthe Korean peninsula is to thoroughly implement the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea-United States \r\nJoint Statement, adopted in June at the historic bilateral \r\nsummit held in Singapore. The Joint Statement contains \r\nall of the issues of principle regarding eventual \r\nsolutions to the issues on the Korean peninsula, such as \r\nterminating the decades-long hostility between the two \r\ncountries and establishing new relations between them, \r\nthus building a robust peace regime on the Korean \r\npeninsula, realizing the complete denuclearization \r\nof the peninsula and promoting humanitarian work \r\nbetween the two countries.\r\nOnce the Joint Statement has been implemented, \r\nthe current trend towards détente will turn into durable \r\npeace, and the complete denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula will also be achieved. As a result, the Korean \r\npeninsula, currently the most intense global hotspot, \r\nwill become a cradle of peace and prosperity that \r\ncontributes to security in Asia and the rest of the world.\r\nThe commitment of the Government of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to the full \r\nimplementation of the Joint Statement is unwavering. The \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n16/53 18-30190\r\nprimary task in ensuring the effective implementation \r\nof the Statement must be to break down the barrier of \r\nmistrust between the two countries that has existed for \r\nseveral decades. To that end, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States should \r\ndevote great efforts to building trust as a top priority. \r\nThe implementation of previous agreements reached \r\nin various dialogues and negotiations between the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United \r\nStates ended in failure because the level of mistrust \r\nbetween them was too high and resulted in a general \r\nlack of confidence.\r\nIt is our position that the denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula should be achieved alongside the \r\nbuilding of a peace regime, on the basis of the principle \r\nof simultaneous actions, step by step, starting with what \r\nwe can do and prioritizing the building of trust. Out of \r\nthe desire and resolute determination to successfully \r\nimplement the Joint Statement, the Government of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is primarily \r\nfocusing its efforts on building trust. Even before the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea-United States \r\nsummit, our Government took significant goodwill \r\nmeasures, such as stopping nuclear and intercontinental \r\nballistic-missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test \r\nsite in a transparent manner and committing not to \r\ntransfer nuclear weapons or nuclear technology under \r\nany circumstances. We continue to make efforts to \r\nbuild trust.\r\nHowever, we do not see any corresponding response \r\nfrom the United States. On the contrary, instead of \r\naddressing our concern about the lack of a peace \r\nregime on the Korean peninsula, the United States has \r\ninsisted on denuclearization first and has increased the \r\nlevel of pressure through sanctions in order to achieve \r\nits purpose through coercion — even objecting to an \r\nend-of-war declaration. The perception that sanctions \r\ncan bring us to our knees is a pipe dream of people who \r\nare ignorant about us. The problem is that the continued \r\nsanctions are deepening our mistrust. The reason behind \r\nthe recent deadlock is that the United States relies on \r\ncoercive methods that are lethal to trust-building.\r\nThe recent dramatic improvement in North-South \r\nrelations and the atmosphere of cooperation clearly \r\nshow how decisive the role of trust-building can be. \r\nIn less than five months, the leaders of the North and \r\nthe South met three times. Through their meetings and \r\ntalks they have been building the trust in one another \r\nthat is necessary to resolve the various issues in North-\r\nSouth relations in a constructive manner, and this has \r\nbeen translated into tangible results.\r\nAs demonstrated by the Pyongyang Joint Declaration \r\nof September 2018, which was jointly announced by the \r\nleaders of the North and the South on 19 September, \r\ndialogue between the two countries in many \r\nareas — including politics, the military, humanitarian \r\nwork, sports, culture and economic cooperation — is \r\nvery active, and there is an unprecedented atmosphere \r\nof reconciliation and cooperation. Many noteworthy \r\noutcomes can be seen, and the process enjoys the \r\nsupport of and is welcomed by the entire Korean nation \r\nand the international community. If South Korea had \r\nbeen the party involved in the issue of denuclearization \r\ninstead of the United States, the denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula would not be at such a deadlock.\r\nThat is why we attach great importance to building \r\nconfidence between the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea and the United States for the implementation \r\nof the Joint Statement. Without trust in the United \r\nStates, we can have no confidence with regard to our \r\nnational security, and, under those circumstances, \r\nthere is no way that we will unilaterally disarm first. \r\nThe commitment of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea to denuclearization is firm. However, it will \r\nbe possible only if the United States sufficiently earns \r\nour trust.\r\nThere are pessimistic views on the implementation \r\nof the Joint Statement inside the United States, but that \r\nis not due to any f law in the Statement itself. Rather, \r\nit is because of the domestic politics of the United \r\nStates. The political opposition there, with the sole \r\npurpose of attacking its political opponent, makes it \r\nits daily business to slander the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, claiming that we cannot be trusted. \r\nThat opposition is forcing the Administration to make \r\nunreasonable unilateral demands on us, thus impeding \r\nthe smooth progress of dialogue and negotiations. \r\nFuelling mistrust of a dialogue partner while relying \r\nonly on coercive methods is not at all helpful in building \r\ntrust; on the contrary, it only increases mistrust.\r\nOn the topic of reasons to distrust each other, it is \r\nwe who have far more reasons to distrust the United \r\nStates. First, the United States acquired nuclear \r\nweapons before we did and is the only country that \r\nhas actually used them in war. From the very first day \r\nof our Republic, 70 years ago, the United States has \r\nmaintained a hostile policy against our country and \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 17/53\r\nhas imposed a total economic blockade on us, ensuring \r\nthat United States companies cannot trade even a single \r\nscrewnail with our country. Even though we have not \r\nthrown so much as a pebble onto United States soil, \r\nduring the Korean War the United States threatened \r\nto drop dozens of atomic bombs on our country. Even \r\nafter that, the United States kept positioning strategic \r\nnuclear arsenals at our doorstep.\r\nIf both countries continue to harbour mistrust \r\ntowards one other and to remain obsessed with the past, \r\nthe recent Joint Statement cannot escape the same fate \r\nas all previous agreements between the two countries, \r\nnamely, failure.\r\nOne part of the spirit of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea-United States summit in Singapore \r\nwas to free ourselves from old, conventional ways and \r\nto try an entirely new way of resolving the issues. At \r\nthis critical juncture, the United States should use \r\nforesight and decide that the faithful fulfilment of the \r\ncommitment that it made in Singapore will, in the end, \r\nbe in its own national interest and should form the basis \r\nof a new method for improving relations between our \r\ntwo countries. Only then will the Joint Statement have \r\npositive prospects. If the Joint Statement falls victim \r\nto American internal politics, the main victim of the \r\nsubsequent unpredictable consequences will be the \r\nUnited States.\r\nImproving bilateral relations and resolving issues \r\non the Korean peninsula is key to achieving the theme \r\nof this session: “Making the United Nations relevant to \r\nall people: global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. Our \r\nnew policy of concentrating all efforts on building \r\nour economy is the right political choice, not only \r\nfor improving the lives of our people but also for \r\nrealizing the common aspirations of people around the \r\nworld — peace and development.\r\nThe international community should support and \r\nencourage our efforts to focus on building the economy \r\nin response to the bold decisions and goodwill measures \r\nthat we have taken for the easing of tension and the \r\nmaintenance of lasting peace on the Korean peninsula. \r\nThe implementation of the Joint Statement is a shared \r\nresponsibility of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea and the United States. The United Nations also \r\nplays a key role.\r\nThe Security Council, which was once so eager \r\nto express its concern about the tense situation on the \r\nKorean peninsula, has recently been silent about the \r\nvaluable momentum for peace that we have achieved \r\nthis year. That is quite strange. The Council rained \r\ndown numerous sanctions resolutions on us, taking \r\nissue with our nuclear tests and missile test launches. \r\nBut now, a full year after such tests were stopped, not a \r\nword in those resolutions has changed, to say nothing of \r\ncompletely removing or easing sanctions. Worse still, \r\nthe Council is taking a very worrying stand by rejecting \r\nthe proposal of some of its member States to issue a \r\npresidential statement that welcomes the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea-United States summit and \r\nthe Joint Statement.\r\nThe United Nations Command in South Korea even \r\nshowed alarming signs of hindering the implementation \r\nof the Panmunjom Declaration on Peace, Prosperity \r\nand Reunification of the Korean Peninsula, reached \r\nbetween the North and the South. As for the United \r\nNations Command, it is merely a command of the \r\nallied forces beyond the control of the United Nations \r\nand only obeys the orders of the United States, yet still \r\nmisuses the sacred name of the Organization.\r\nBased on the mission of the Organization as \r\ndefined in the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nOrganization, and especially the Security Council, has \r\nthe responsibility and duty to support and welcome \r\ndevelopments that help to ensure international peace \r\nand security. The United Nations should really apply \r\nthe theme of this session to its actual activities and thus \r\nrid itself, as soon as possible, of the stigma of the feeling \r\nthat the Security Council equals the United States.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Abdelkader Messahel, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Algeria.\r\nMr. Messahel (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme at the outset to express my warm and fraternal \r\ncongratulations to Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa \r\nGarcés on her outstanding election to preside over \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-third session. \r\nHer vast experience in international political affairs \r\nwill undoubtedly contribute greatly to the successful \r\nconduct of the work of the Assembly. In our capacity as \r\nVice-President elected by the Assembly, we assure her \r\nof our full support in carrying out her noble task.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay \r\ntribute to Mr. Miroslav Lajčák for his dedicated \r\ncommitment in the way he managed the previous \r\nsession. I am also deeply grateful to Secretary-General \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n18/53 18-30190\r\nAntónio Guterres for his enlightened leadership and \r\nfor his laudable initiatives since he assumed his post. \r\nHis efforts are aimed at giving renewed impetus \r\nto our Organization, particularly in the essential \r\ndomains pertaining to international peace, security \r\nand development.\r\nIt is highly regrettable that the entire world continues \r\nto experience an unprecedented and multifaceted crisis; \r\nthe Secretary-General was right in warning about the \r\nrisks that that entails. He rightly warned that conflicts \r\nhad worsened and that new dangers are emerging (see \r\nA/73/PV.6). Global concerns related to nuclear weapons \r\nhave not reached the current level since the Second \r\nWorld War. Environmental imbalances are occurring \r\nfaster than our responses can deal with them, and the \r\ngap resulting from the current differences is growing \r\nwider, while gross human rights violations are taking \r\nplace and nationalism and xenophobia are on the rise.\r\nIn the context of the advanced and inevitable growth \r\nin globalization that we face, the seriousness of those \r\ncolossal challenges, both old and new, are aggravated \r\nby the perverse effects of the continuing economic \r\nand financial crisis. Against that backdrop, which \r\nhas become even more alarming owing to the recent \r\nappearance of unilateral and protectionist trends, we \r\nmust have the courage to recognize the inadequacy and \r\nfutility of the policies that have been implemented to \r\ndate and the structural deficiencies of the increasingly \r\nineffective global governance architecture.\r\nWhen he acceded to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its twenty-ninth session, President \r\nAbdelaziz Bouteflika warned that membership in the \r\nUnited Nations was not enough to protect nations against \r\nhunger and insecurity (see A/PV.2233). Today, we can \r\nno longer accept the perpetuation of an international \r\norder that does not encourage the international values \r\nof peace, justice and development, as well as science \r\nand technology, while contributing to improving living \r\nconditions. That order has concentrated economic and \r\nfinancial resources in the hands of a small minority, \r\nwidening the existing gap that separates the richest \r\nfrom the poorest countries and peoples. The unfortunate \r\nconclusion is that we are facing a real moral crisis.\r\nI would like to commend the rightness and \r\nappropriateness of the theme chosen for our session. \r\nIndeed, now more than ever, the United Nations must \r\nfind ways and means that enable it to fully play the \r\nrole that its founding fathers envisioned for it following \r\nthe devastation of a global confrontation. Such a vital \r\nobjective for the entire international community cannot \r\nbe achieved without a renewed collective commitment \r\nto effective and real multilateralism, in harmony with \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations — a \r\ncommitment to which the former Secretary-General, \r\nthe late Kofi Annan, a worthy son of Africa and a \r\ncommitted citizen of the world, dedicated his life and \r\nwith which he associated his name. While the United \r\nNations remains the distinctive forum for dialogue and \r\ncooperation among the nations of the world, it must \r\nalso bring about the desired change.\r\nIn our view, the genuine change that we seek and \r\nwhich is of the utmost priority requires us to mobilize \r\nall our capabilities and efforts with a view to reforming \r\nthe United Nations itself. It is imperative that the reform \r\nshould involve both the structures and the operating \r\nmethods of the Organization, particularly the Security \r\nCouncil, by paying particular attention in the first place \r\nto redressing the historical injustice done to the African \r\ncontinent in terms of its underrepresentation in both \r\nmembership categories of that body. The reform must \r\nalso include the revitalization of the role of the General \r\nAssembly and the strengthening of its authority — a \r\nnecessity around which there is, fortunately, a growing \r\nconsensus.\r\nConscious of our responsibilities and contributions \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nand with full respect for the cardinal principles of our \r\nforeign policy, Algeria follows with particular interest \r\nthe crises and conflicts facing the countries in our \r\nregion. While continuing to fully play our role to the \r\nbest of our ability, my country reiterates its conviction, \r\non the basis of our own experience, that conflicts cannot \r\nbe totally resolved without promoting solutions that are \r\nowned by the parties concerned and reached through \r\ninclusive dialogue and that place national interests \r\nabove all other considerations, thereby preserving the \r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of \r\nStates. Whether related to the situations in Mali, Libya, \r\nSyria or Yemen, only such an approach can enable those \r\nsisterly countries to restore peace and stability so that \r\nthey may begin their rebuilding process.\r\nWith regard to the Western Sahara issue, which \r\ncomes before the United Nations as an issue of \r\ndecolonization, Algeria believes that its settlement can \r\nbe achieved only by allowing the people of the Western \r\nSahara to exercise their inalienable and non-assignable \r\nright to self-determination.\r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 19/53\r\nMy country reiterates its firm support for the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal \r\nEnvoy for Western Sahara and expresses the hope that \r\ntheir actions, together with the input of the African \r\nUnion, will contribute to the resumption of negotiations \r\nwithout preconditions and in good faith between the \r\ntwo parties to the conflict, namely, the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco and the POLISARIO Front, with a view to \r\nreaching a mutually acceptable political solution that \r\nensures the self-determination of the people of Western \r\nSahara.\r\nIn the same vein, Algeria is convinced that only \r\na solution based on international legitimacy and the \r\nrecognition of the inalienable national rights of the \r\nPalestinian people, including their right to establish \r\nan independent State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its \r\ncapital, can put a definitive end to the conflict that has \r\nexisted in the Middle East for seven decades.\r\nTerrorism, of which Algeria was the first target at the \r\nend of the last century, has now become one of the most \r\ndestructive scourges on the planet. At the cost of heavy \r\nsacrifices, my country was able to confront it alone by \r\nadopting an approach and by harnessing methods that \r\nhave proved to be effective. That experience, which we \r\nare willing to share, was based on the conviction that \r\naddressing terrorism must imperatively tackle its root \r\ncauses and must be accompanied by a policy that is \r\nresolute against violent extremism.\r\nThe international community is particularly called \r\nupon to ensure that the fight against terrorism is \r\naccompanied by measures to fight extremism and the \r\npromotion of policies that advocate coexistence. In that \r\ncontext, I am pleased to recall that the United Nations \r\nresolution declaring 16 May as the International Day of \r\nLiving Together in Peace (resolution 72/130), which was \r\ninitiated by Algeria, is part of the efforts to promote \r\nthe principle of an inclusive dialogue leading the quest \r\nfor solutions to the challenges to stability at both the \r\nnational and the international levels.\r\nWe are proud that the values and principles of \r\nliving together in peace were the basis of the policy of \r\ncivil harmony and national reconciliation, which was \r\nimplemented with determination by President Abdelaziz \r\nBouteflika of the Republic of Algeria in order to end \r\nthe national tragedy and reconcile Algerians with each \r\nother.\r\nThose unifying ideals are considered above all to \r\nbe the common factor among the strategies, policies \r\nand programmes that were implemented in the various \r\neconomic, social, educational, cultural and religious \r\nfields. Those same principles consistently guide \r\nmy country’s foreign policy in our relations with \r\nneighbouring countries and other countries of the \r\nworld.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development \r\nare remarkable achievements that require the substantial \r\nmobilization of both the means and the capabilities for \r\ntheir implementation. We express the hope that the \r\noutcome of the High-level Meeting on Financing the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was \r\nconvened by the Secretary-General on 24 September, \r\nwill provide a solid foundation for concerted action \r\nbetween the United Nations system and Member \r\nStates for development in line with the aspirations of \r\ndeveloping countries, as advocated by the Group of 77.\r\nAlgeria, which participated actively in the \r\ndevelopment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, is about to finalize its national progress \r\nreport for 2016-2018 on the implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, for voluntary \r\nsubmission to the Economic and Social Council in \r\nJuly 2019. That is part of the new development agenda \r\nadopted by Algeria in 2016. It is a policy that aims \r\nto place Algeria among emerging countries by 2035, \r\nenabling it to diversify and transform its economy \r\nthrough the revival and consolidation of its economic \r\ngrowth. That will benefit all its citizens, as well as \r\ncountries of the region as a whole.\r\nBefore concluding, I cannot but commend the \r\nefforts made by our national authorities regarding the \r\nrecent constitutional review, which seeks to benefit all \r\nsegments of Algerian society, in particular the rights \r\nof women and supporting them to be independent, as \r\nwell as support for young people in order to ensure their \r\neffective integration into the country’s economic and \r\nsocial development process. Those efforts have earned \r\nthe recognition of the international community for their \r\nfocus on promoting both human rights and stability and \r\nsecurity. We are honoured by such acknowledgements \r\nand feel reassured in our global approach.\r\nThe rejection of policies based on force, with the \r\ndangers that they entail, requires that we constantly \r\nseek, through dialogue and consensus, to strengthen \r\nmultilateral action. In our view, that is the best way \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n20/53 18-30190\r\nto respond to the global security and development \r\nchallenges facing the nations and countries of the world. \r\nThrough its focus on demonstrating the efficiency and \r\neffectiveness for which everyone yearns, the United \r\nNations plays a central role in the endeavour to restore \r\nthe respect owed to it.\r\nThe success of the United Nations is a success \r\nfor all. We must work to make it a forum not only \r\nfor discussing our differences but also for resolving \r\nthem. Our Organization should be the place where our \r\npartnerships are forged.\r\nWe particularly commend the General Assembly’s \r\nunanimous acceptance of the concept of living together \r\nin peace. Algeria believes that failure to live in peace \r\nis not inevitable. Conflicts, human tragedies, terrorism \r\nand environmental disasters do not affect only certain \r\npeople and not others. Destiny is a common thing, as \r\nPresident Bouteflika said.\r\nWe are called on to make the United Nations \r\na unique means to serve peaceful and sustainable \r\nsocieties. Given our conviction and approach, Algeria \r\nwill in all cases be a loyal and committed partner for \r\nachieving peace and development.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now call \r\non Her Excellency Ms. Yldiz Pollack-Beigle, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Suriname.\r\nMs. Pollack-Beigle (Suriname): It is an honour \r\nto deliver this statement on behalf of my President, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Desiré Delano Bouterse. My \r\ncountry sincerely applauds the election of Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés as the first woman of the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean region to preside over \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-third session. In \r\nthe course of this session, the membership stands to \r\ngain greatly from her outstanding personal qualities \r\nand wealth of experience as a professional diplomat at \r\nthe helm of our General Assembly. Suriname pledges \r\nits unwavering support for her efforts to make our \r\nOrganization relevant again for the entire global \r\ncommunity, in particular the disadvantaged and the \r\nmarginalized, including women and young people.\r\nAs we remember the legacy of the late former \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, we honour his tireless \r\nefforts to make the world more peaceful and humane \r\nby fighting against inequality and injustice, combating \r\ndiseases and resolving conflicts with all of the means at \r\nour disposal, while making the United Nations the focal \r\npoint of multilateralism.\r\nAs honoured as I am to address this gathering \r\nthat brings together so many world leaders, I am \r\nalso disheartened by the sombre tone expressed by \r\nSecretary-General Guterres in the presentation of his \r\nannual report on the work of our Organization (A/73/1). \r\nAs the Secretary-General noted, thetargets set last year \r\nhave not been met. We have to ask ourselves if we will \r\nmake the same appeals this year, with the same attitude \r\nof “business as usual” with regard to outcomes, whether \r\nor not they will be effective.\r\nSuriname concurs with the assessment of the \r\nSecretary-General that the fundamental issue \r\nconfronting the international community today is the \r\nlack of trust among nations. In that regard, as a small \r\nnation, my country firmly commits to upholding \r\ninternationally accepted principles that clearly define \r\nwho we are and provide for predictable actions in our \r\ninternational relations, thereby creating a climate of \r\ntrust, understanding and respect. We underscore the \r\nneed for a rules-based world order with the United \r\nNations at the centre. That is required in order to create \r\nthe necessary platform to address global concerns, \r\nincluding the mobilization of funds to mitigate the \r\neffects of climate change.\r\nBeing a low-lying coastal State, Suriname is among \r\nthe most threatened countries directly impacted by sea-\r\nlevel rise. Approximately 80 per cent of our population \r\nresides in coastal areas, and our main production \r\nactivities are also concentrated in that area, resulting \r\nin an existential threat. As we have witnessed in recent \r\ndays, the forces of nature have struck once again — not \r\nonly in our sister Caribbean nations but also elsewhere \r\nin the world. We are being urged to move beyond \r\nrhetoric and to take immediate action.\r\nMy country is strategically located on the Guiana \r\nShield. My country has an abundance of natural \r\nresources, unique biodiversity and an impressive \r\nforest cover of more than 90 per cent. Moreover, \r\nour population, including indigenous peoples, tribal \r\ncommunities of African descent and various other \r\nethnic groups, descends from all the continents of the \r\nworld. All express and enjoy exceptional tolerance, \r\nreligious freedom and respect for one another’s cultures \r\nand backgrounds and are equally entitled in terms of \r\naccess to social programmes, including health care and \r\neducation. We have used that diversity, inherited from \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 21/53\r\nour colonial past, to our advantage by rejecting the \r\ndivide-and-rule of yesteryear. We are indeed proud that \r\nour people, coming from various ethnic and religious \r\nbackgrounds, can live in peace and harmony with one \r\nanother, forging bonds conducive to nation-building and \r\nworking towards the well-being of all citizens — both \r\nyoung and old.\r\nWith regard to our economic challenges and \r\npolicy measures, my country, as a commodity-based \r\nexport economy, is highly vulnerable to commodity-\r\nprice shocks. The sharp downturn in gold and oil \r\nprices three years ago and the closure of the century-\r\nold bauxite operation in 2016 have led to a sharp \r\nrecession and a severe loss of Government revenue. The \r\neconomy contracted by a combined 8 per cent, while \r\nthe Government lost more than a third of its fiscal \r\nrevenue in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). \r\nThat required unprecedented fiscal and monetary \r\npolicy adjustments in order to stabilize the exchange \r\nrate, reduce domestic demand and re-establish a viable \r\nbalance of payments position. Our monetary authorities \r\nmoved to a f lexible exchange-rate regime and sharply \r\ncurtailed credit creation in the country. Since October \r\n2016, the exchange rate has been stabilized, monthly \r\ninflation rates have fallen to less than 1 per cent, \r\nand there is no longer a current account deficit in the \r\nbalance of payments.\r\nThe fiscal responses, usually a more difficult \r\nundertaking, began early in August 2015 with a massive \r\ncontraction in Government expenditure and increases \r\nin taxation. While the crisis continued to erode revenue \r\nin terms of GDP, expenditure was cut from more than \r\n30 per cent of GDP in 2015 to less than 23 per cent in \r\n2017. As a result, the unsustainable deficit of 10 per \r\ncent of GDP that emerged during the crisis years has \r\nalready been reduced to an estimated 5 per cent of \r\nGDP in 2018. Looking ahead, the Government also \r\nput in place significant reforms to limit the impact of \r\nfuture export-commodity shocks. Institutional reforms \r\nwill help to promote foreign direct investment aimed \r\nat diversifying our economy, moving it away from its \r\nheavy reliance on extractive industries. Fiscal reforms \r\naimed at reducing reliance on direct tax income and \r\nbroadening the tax base are at the top of our priorities. \r\nThe establishment of a sovereign wealth fund will \r\nstabilize income derived from the extractive industries \r\nand help to mitigate the fiscal impact of future shocks. \r\nThe International Monetary Fund and international \r\nrating agencies have commended those efforts and \r\npredict a continued improvement in the macroeconomic \r\nperformance of Suriname.\r\nOur efforts have indeed borne fruit, and the \r\nGovernment is committed to continuing fiscal policies \r\naimed at restoring the primary fiscal surplus. Those \r\nefforts to steer us on the right path towards development \r\nare hampered by obstacles that are unjustifiable \r\nand not of our making. First of all, I would like to \r\nmention the matter of Suriname’s classification as a \r\nmiddle-income country — an issue to which I alluded \r\nfrom this very rostrum last year (see A/72/PV.21) but \r\nwhich remains unresolved. Our classification, like \r\nthat of many other developing countries, including \r\nthose in the Caribbean, is based on GDP per capita, \r\nwhich does not reflect our vulnerabilities. We strongly \r\nreject that unrealistic classification, which disregards \r\nvarious factors and creates great challenges for us. \r\nIt is a matter that should be addressed with urgency. \r\nAccess to concessional financing for our development \r\nis critical to the implementation of programmes that \r\nbenefit all our citizens. Correspondent banking and \r\nde-risking, further aggravated by unilateral actions, \r\nincluding blacklisting and the arbitrary seizure of \r\nfunds, without due regard for the severe consequences \r\nto the community, including businessmen and families, \r\nremain obstacles over which we have no influence. An \r\natmosphere of trust and political will is crucial and \r\nshould lead to dialogue and cooperation in order to \r\naddress all matters of concern.\r\nAlthough Suriname contributes significantly to \r\nthe mitigation of the effects of climate change through \r\nits high level of forest cover and low deforestation \r\nrate, regrettably, we must acknowledge that global \r\ncommitments, based on the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities, have yet to materialize \r\nin the form of tangible results. Suriname is one of 11 \r\ncountries with a high level of forest cover and a low \r\ndeforestation rate, representing 20 per cent of the \r\nEarth’s remaining tropical forests and storing 18 per \r\ncent of tropical forest carbon. Yet we are not able to \r\nfully benefit from global arrangements associated \r\nwith sound forest management. At the twenty-third \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change last year, \r\nSuriname pledged to maintain its forest coverage at \r\n93 per cent. We also made the conditional commitment \r\nto sustain our leadership position as one of the most \r\ncarbon-negative countries. That pledge, subject to \r\nscientific, technological, technical and financial \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n22/53 18-30190\r\nsupport, extends beyond national benefits into the \r\nrealm of global gains for humankind. It is against the \r\nbackdrop of that reality that Suriname will host a high-\r\nlevel conference on climate finance mobilization in \r\nFebruary 2019. The conference will seek to initiate and \r\nimplement new economic models of ecosustainability \r\naimed at improving the quality of life for all.\r\nThe scourges of illicit drug trafficking, \r\ntransnational organized crime and terrorism, as well as \r\ntrafficking in arms and persons, place an unprecedented \r\nburden on the financial and human-resource capacity \r\nof small developing countries, hampering their ability \r\nto implement policy measures aimed at achieving \r\ndevelopment objectives. Drug abuse and drug \r\ntrafficking destroy families, disrupt communities and \r\nrob our youth of a productive future. Our open borders \r\ncompel us to strengthen cooperation with adjacent, \r\nneighbouring and other countries in order to effectively \r\ncombat transnational organized crime and its negative \r\nconsequences. Such cooperation must yield results, \r\nand we will join others in the fight against the world \r\ndrug problem. We need more than lip service today. We \r\nneed to join one another in taking action. Likewise, we \r\nsolicit international cooperation to protect our unique \r\nbiodiversity, which is under threat, owing to illegal \r\npoaching and trade in endangered species.\r\nWith regard to our collaboration at the bilateral, \r\nsubregional and multilateral levels, Suriname continues \r\nto stand for international peace and security. We advocate \r\nfor dialogue in the resolution of any existing conflict \r\nand uphold the internationally accepted principles \r\nof non-interference, non-intervention and respect \r\nfor sovereignty and territorial integrity. Suriname \r\nrespects and protects all human rights. However, we \r\nstrongly reject using human rights for political gains. \r\nAll conflicts that arise are a consequence of departing \r\nfrom those valued principles. That is why I would \r\nlike to reiterate that those valued principles form the \r\nbedrock of Suriname’s foreign policy. In the same vein, \r\nmy country applauds those who have chosen the path of \r\ndialogue to resolve their disputes. In that regard, allow \r\nme to mention the rapprochement between countries in \r\nthe Horn of Africa and on the Korean peninsula.\r\nOur geographic location positions us as a strategic \r\nhub. As such, Suriname has strengthened its bonds with \r\nneighbouring and adjacent countries and with those \r\nwith whom we enjoy remarkable historic ties. As we \r\nstrengthen partnerships based on mutual respect and \r\nbenefit, we seek to advance our national development \r\nobjectives with a focus on agriculture and tourism \r\nthrough foreign direct investments, South-South \r\ncooperation and regional partnerships. Suriname, \r\nwith its human capital as its greatest asset and an \r\nabundance of natural resources, such as fresh water, \r\noil, gold, bauxite and other minerals, maintains warm \r\nand friendly relations with many countries. We focus \r\non reinforcing existing partnerships and initiating new \r\nones. As a result, many friends from all corners of the \r\nworld are seeking to forge durable partnerships, based \r\non mutual respect and benefit.\r\nThe Latin American and Caribbean region has \r\nnot been spared from tensions resulting from existing \r\ndifferences of opinion on various issues. The 2014 \r\nProclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a \r\nZone of Peace has certainly contributed to ensuring that \r\nthere is no room for military adventures. We strongly \r\nappeal for dialogue where there are differences. We \r\nmust prevent outside forces from imposing their agenda \r\non us, which run counter to our own interests as a \r\nregion. Let us focus on what binds us and not on what \r\ndivides us. It is reprehensible that some economically \r\npowerful countries resort to applying unilateral \r\nsanctions when they encounter ideological and political \r\ndifferences. Such economic warfare does not augur \r\nwell for solving disputes. On the contrary, positions \r\nare hardened with far-reaching consequences for \r\nregional and international stability, peace and security. \r\nSuriname strongly rejects such coercive economic \r\nand trade measures, as they are counterproductive \r\nand create an atmosphere of distrust, rendering the \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes practically impossible. \r\nIn that regard, we disapprove of the continuation of the \r\neconomic, financial and commercial embargo against \r\nCuba and its people. Time and again, the majority of \r\nnations has taken a stand against that embargo. Is it not \r\nnow time to honour the demand of the majority of the \r\ninternational community and end the blockade?\r\nThe current arms race is deplorable and consumes \r\ntremendous amounts of resources. Imagine what we \r\ncould have achieved in terms of making the world \r\nmore humane if those resources had been channelled \r\ninto combating disease and hunger and improving food \r\nsafety and security. Who would not aspire to those \r\nsustainable goals? Like many other countries, Suriname \r\ncalls for an end to the arms race, while also rejecting \r\nthe militarization of outer space and research in the \r\narea of artificial intelligence for warfare purposes.\r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 23/53\r\nMultilateralism remains essential for undertaking \r\njoint actions aimed at achieving sustainable development \r\nand addressing matters of global concern, such as \r\nmaintaining peace and security, combating terrorism \r\nand transnational organized crime and addressing \r\nthe issue of climate change. Suriname supports those \r\ninitiatives, as we seek to reinforce the validity of \r\nmultilateralism based on the purposes and principles of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe are convinced that the United Nations remains \r\nthe most important body  for discussing all matters \r\nconcerning the international community, with the aim \r\nof finding solutions and taking into consideration the \r\ninterests of Member States. It is therefore essential to \r\nmake this institution more relevant by making it more \r\ndemocratic, transparent and accountable. Continued \r\nefforts to reform the United Nations remain crucial \r\nif we wish to reflect the realities of today’s world. \r\nFor example, the process to reform the Security \r\nCouncil must be comprehensive, inclusive, balanced \r\nand consensus-based, while taking into account the \r\ninterests of both developed and developing countries \r\nand further promoting, preserving and strengthening \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe President’s priorities for the seventy-third \r\nsession have been noted, and Suriname is fully supportive, \r\nas we work together to make the Organization relevant \r\nonce again. We have to ensure that our youth is engaged \r\nand participates in a structured manner in the affairs \r\nof this world body, recognizing the fact that they are \r\nunique and innovative in their own way. As lead head \r\nin the Caribbean Community for youth development, \r\nSuriname wholeheartedly supports the views expressed \r\nearlier in the debate advocating for the creation of a \r\nUnited Nations agency dealing with youth. I expect that \r\nthe recently launched United Nations Youth Strategy \r\nwill be inclusive and deliver on the aspirations of the \r\nworld’s young people.\r\nIn the final analysis, when Suriname speaks, we \r\nspeak to give strength to the voices of all nations, \r\nwhether small or big, developed or developing. We must \r\nglobally recommit to the principle of dialogue and the \r\ncause of lasting peace. That recommitment, which I call \r\non all of us to embrace, is the inherent right to a decent \r\nlife and protection for all who are born on this planet. \r\nThrough our Organization, we have at our disposal all \r\nthe means needed to take on that responsibility. We \r\nhave no one but ourselves do that for us.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that, if there were \r\nno United Nations, today we would be calling for its \r\ncreation. Therefore, as I said before, let us decide to \r\nfocus on what binds us rather than on what divides us.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Singapore.\r\nMr. Balakrishnan (Singapore): It is a bright and \r\nsunny Saturday morning outside. I thank members \r\nfor sacrificing their time to participate in this debate. \r\nI add my voice to those who congratulate Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés of Ecuador on her election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session. I also thank my friend Miroslav Lajčák, \r\nMinister for Foreign and European Affairs of Slovakia, \r\nfor his sterling leadership of the seventy-second session.\r\nThe one word that we have probably heard the most \r\nover this past week is “multilateralism”. Multilateralism \r\nis at a crossroads. In fact, it is facing a significant \r\nthreat. In recent years, we have witnessed a crisis of \r\nconfidence in the concept of multilateralism and its \r\ninstitutions. Whether in trade, security or dispute \r\nresolution, questions have arisen about whether the \r\nmultilateral system can continue to deliver effective \r\nsolutions for the multitude of problems that we \r\nface. I stand here as a representative of a tiny, open \r\nand trade-dependent city State, and Singapore has \r\nwitnessed this recent retreat from multilateralism with \r\ngrave concern. That is why today I want to raise my \r\nvoice in defence of multilateralism. There is perhaps no \r\nbetter forum for me to do so than the United Nations, \r\nthe ultimate bastion of multilateralism.\r\nIt is actually easy to understand why there is \r\na resurgence in isolationist, protectionist and even \r\nxenophobic sentiments in the political arena all over \r\nthe world. We are living in uncertain, volatile and \r\ndisruptive times. The digital revolution is increasingly \r\ndisrupting the way we live, work, play, communicate, \r\norganize and mobilize our societies. Non-State actors \r\nand transboundary threats, terrorism, pandemics and \r\nclimate change remain a clear and present danger. \r\nFrontier issues such as artificial intelligence and \r\ncybercrime have leapt from the pages of science fiction \r\ninto our daily lives. Our social cohesion is breaking \r\ndown, and all too often we operate in isolated social \r\nand political bubbles.\r\nAt the same time, the international order as we know \r\nit is being disrupted. Since 1945, many countries and \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n24/53 18-30190\r\nregions have benefited from the open global system — a \r\nworld order that was substantially underwritten by a \r\nsingle Power: the United States of America. But today \r\nwe are transitioning to a multipolar world, where other \r\nPowers are quite rightly beginning to assume a greater \r\nrole in multiple spheres. That is a transition that has to \r\nbe managed carefully and delicately.\r\nI am not saying that multilateralism is perfect. \r\nIn fact, we recognize that it has not always fulfilled \r\nall its promises. And, quite frankly, sometimes it \r\nhas been oversold as a panacea. How then do we \r\nmake multilateralism work in this rapidly shifting \r\ngeostrategic context? My take is that every State has \r\nto make room to accommodate the new realities and \r\nfind a new modus vivendi. Foreign policy and trade \r\npolicy actually always begin at home. Politics is always \r\nlocal. We need to achieve a rebalancing in our domestic \r\nsocieties and political spheres, as well as in the global, \r\ninternational sphere. The global order will need to \r\nevolve. Our responsibilities will need to be rebalanced. \r\nIn this perilous period of transition, we cannot and \r\nshould not abandon the rules-based world order that has \r\nbrought about unprecedented peace and prosperity for \r\n70 years.\r\nIn fact, the scale and transboundary nature of the \r\nchallenges that we face today demand more cohesion \r\nand cooperation, not less. There is a strong case to be \r\nmade for doubling down on multilateralism, rather than \r\nretreating from it. We need a clear framework of rules \r\nand norms so as to ensure predictability and stability \r\nin inter-State relations and commerce. Defining those \r\nrules through a multilateral process in which all States \r\nengage with one another as equals is necessary in order \r\nto build consensus and to strengthen respect for the rule \r\nof law.\r\nCompliance with the agreed rules by all States is \r\nnot only essential for global stability and for governing \r\nthe global commons, it is especially crucial for a small \r\ncity-State like Singapore. The principle that agreements \r\nshould be respected and implemented is fundamental \r\nfor our survival. Without the rule of international law \r\nthe strong do what they will, and the weak will suffer \r\nwhat we must.\r\nFor small States like Singapore, we cannot survive \r\nin such a world. That is why Singapore has always been \r\na staunch defender of the United Nations, international \r\nlaw and the multilateral system. Let us take trade, \r\nfor example. Globalization has actually not benefited \r\neveryone equally. There remain pockets of poverty and \r\nhunger in our world. Our people are worried about jobs. \r\nUnfortunately, the conventional arguments in favour \r\nof free trade, economic integration, and cooperation \r\nbetween countries have gone out of fashion.\r\nToday, trade frictions between the United States \r\nand China have raised the spectre of a trade war. But we \r\ncannot simply blame globalization. All Governments \r\nof today have an obligation to consider long-term and \r\nsustainable solutions, instead of just raising trade \r\nbarriers. For example, in order to truly address widening \r\ninequality and wage stagnation we must address the \r\nroot causes. In the midst of the digital revolution, we \r\nmust ensure that our people have the right skills for new \r\nemerging jobs. It is futile to fight to protect obsolete \r\ntechnologies and to squabble over yesterday’s jobs. On \r\nthe contrary, we must try to take advantage of the new \r\nopportunities of the global market to create the jobs of \r\nthe future.\r\nIt is therefore our responsibility, as Governments, \r\nto actively put in place policies to train, retrain, retool \r\nand reskill our citizens by investing in infrastructure, \r\ntraining and education. That is why we in Singapore are \r\nworking so hard to restructure our education system. \r\nWe are putting in serious money to enable our people \r\nto continuously upgrade and learn new skills through \r\na programme we call SkillsFuture. The emphasis is \r\non the word “future”. Right now, in Singapore our \r\nfocus is on restructuring our economy, identifying \r\nand working with the private sector to transform jobs, \r\nenhance our competitiveness and elevate productivity \r\nacross the board. That is fundamentally an investment \r\nin our people to make sure that all of us are ready for \r\nthe future.\r\nUltimately, no country benefits from trade conflicts \r\nand protectionism. The negative impacts will ripple \r\nthrough the global supply chain and will undermine \r\ngrowth and prosperity in all countries. We will all be \r\nworse off. At this time of increasing interconnectedness \r\nand interdependence we need a multilateral approach \r\nand strong rules, now more than ever. Singapore will \r\ncontinue to be a strong and staunch supporter of the \r\nrules-based multilateral trading system. The critical \r\nimportance of the World Trade Organization cannot \r\nbe overemphasized: it is the ultimate neutral arbiter of \r\ninternational trade disputes.\r\nAnother area where we urgently need to promote \r\nthe adoption and implementation of rules and norms is \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 25/53\r\nin cyberspace. To reap the full benefits of the digital \r\nrevolution, we must develop a trusted, open and \r\ninclusive cyberspace underpinned by international law \r\nand well-defined norms of responsible State behaviour. \r\nThe International Telecommunication Union has \r\nranked Singapore as the country most committed \r\nto cybersecurity in 2017. Yet, in July this year, we \r\ndiscovered that one of Singapore’s major health \r\ndatabases had been subjected to an advanced persistent \r\nthreat. That was a deliberate, targeted and sophisticated \r\ncyberattack. No country is immune to such attacks. But \r\nall of us need to work together to prevent them. We \r\nneed to implement norms and rules that will prohibit \r\nsuch attacks on critical infrastructure, particularly \r\nwhere lives are at stake.\r\nStates have always turned to the United Nations as \r\nthe only universal, inclusive, multilateral forum that \r\ncan develop the rules that govern the global commons. \r\nOne example is the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS), which provides the global \r\nlegal framework for all activities in the oceans and seas, \r\nwhich we depend on for trade, food and resources. Just \r\nas Singapore strongly supported the UNCLOS process \r\nin the past, Singapore stands ready now to contribute \r\nto the United Nations work aimed at developing and \r\nadopting norms and rules on cybersecurity. That is \r\nsimply another example of the global commons, and we \r\ncannot allow the tragedy of the commons to occur in \r\ncyberspace, in the sea or in the area of climate change.\r\nTo that end, we support the reconvening of the Group \r\nof Governmental Experts (GGE) on Developments in \r\nthe Field of Information and Telecommunications in the \r\nContext of International Security and the continuation \r\nof its work in developing the norms for States’ behaviour \r\nin cyberspace. Cybersecurity has been a priority \r\nunder Singapore’s chairmanship of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN). At the third ASEAN \r\nMinisterial Conference on Cybersecurity, which was \r\nheld in Singapore just last week, all 10 ASEAN member \r\nStates agreed to subscribe in principle to the 11 norms \r\ncontained in the 2015 report of the GGE (A/70/174).\r\nSingapore is also committed to capacity-building, \r\nwhich we feel is essential for States in their efforts \r\nto effectively implement rules and norms of State \r\nbehaviour. Singapore will launch an ASEAN-Singapore \r\nCybersecurity Centre of Excellence in 2019. We have \r\nalso partnered with the United Nations Office for \r\nDisarmament Affairs on a United Nations-Singapore \r\nCyber Programme, which will raise awareness and \r\nbuild capacity in our region.\r\nOur work in ASEAN is rooted in our belief \r\nthat regional organizations can demonstrate how \r\nmultilateralism continues to be relevant and beneficial \r\nfor people all over the world. As the Chair of ASEAN \r\nthis year, Singapore will continue to work with all our \r\nmember States and our external partners to ensure \r\nthat the regional architecture remains open, inclusive \r\nand rules-based. We are working with our partners \r\nto conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic \r\nPartnership. When that is concluded, the Partnership \r\nwill be the world’s largest trading bloc, accounting \r\nfor up to a third of the world’s GDP. But our interest \r\nis not just in big trade figures. We also want to send \r\na powerful message that ASEAN member States \r\nand our six partners — India, China, Japan, Korea, \r\nAustralia and New Zealand — stand for and are \r\ncommitted to free trade, regional integration and \r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nASEAN Member States are also working together to \r\nleverage the digital revolution for our peoples’ benefit. \r\nWe established the ASEAN Smart Cities Network at \r\nthe thirty-second ASEAN Summit in April. The Smart \r\nCities Network focuses on ensuring interoperability \r\nand the integration of services, and allows cities in our \r\nregion to share experiences and exchange solutions and \r\nlessons learned. We have just concluded an ASEAN \r\nagreement on streamlining e-commerce within South-\r\nEast Asia so that our businesses can market and sell \r\ntheir products easily, conveniently and seamlessly \r\nacross South-East Asia.\r\nASEAN member States are also committed to the \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes, and to doing so through \r\na multilateral process. In that connection let me now \r\naddress my friends in Myanmar, and particularly the \r\nsituation in Rakhine state, which is a matter of grave \r\nconcern for the region and beyond. The crisis is a \r\ncomplex and deep-rooted intercommunal conflict, the \r\nroots of which go back centuries. More recently, we \r\nhave read harrowing accounts of brutal and shocking \r\natrocities. We have to condemn all human rights \r\nviolations, threats, loss of life and the violence inflicted \r\non defenceless people.\r\nWe expect the Independent Commission of Inquiry \r\nestablished by the Government of Myanmar to carry \r\nout impartial investigations expeditiously and to hold \r\nthose responsible fully accountable. We also hope that \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n26/53 18-30190\r\nthe voluntary return of refugees to Myanmar in a safe, \r\nsecure and dignified manner will commence soon \r\nwithout undue delay.\r\nHowever, ultimately, a political solution needs \r\nto be found — a solution and process that involves \r\nreconciliation, fairness, justice and better prospects for \r\nall communities. Only then can we achieve a durable \r\nsolution to that complex, long-standing problem. All \r\nmembers of ASEAN stand ready to support and assist \r\nMyanmar in that very challenging and difficult situation.\r\nMr. Tiare (Burkina Faso), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe have also been watching the developments \r\non the Korean peninsula, which is not far from our \r\nregion. This year, Singapore was able to make a small \r\ncontribution towards easing tensions by hosting the \r\nsummit between the United States and the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea leaders in June. That \r\nsummit, as well as the three inter-Korean dialogues that \r\nhave been held this year, are important steps towards \r\nthe achievement of lasting peace and stability on the \r\nKorean peninsula. Singapore hopes that dialogue and \r\nthe associated efforts and the reservoir of trust that \r\nhas been built up will bring peace ultimately to that \r\ntroubled part of Asia.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that there is no doubt \r\nthat multilateralism needs to be defended and that the \r\nUnited Nations itself needs to be strengthened. That \r\nis the only way we can deal with the complex global \r\nchallenges of the future. As States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, each of us has a responsibility to work \r\ntogether and to improve and adapt the multilateral \r\nsystems that we have built painstakingly over the past \r\nseven decades. We need to find solutions and build \r\nconsensus, so that our people can lead better, more \r\nsecure and more peaceful lives. Ultimately, a rules-\r\nbased multilateral system is absolutely indispensable \r\nto our efforts to secure peace and prosperity for our \r\npeople at home on this one planet that we call Earth.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Nicola Renzi, Minister for \r\nForeign and Political Affairs and Justice of the Republic \r\nof San Marino.\r\nMr. Renzi (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of San Marino, I would \r\nlike to congratulate Her Excellency María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés on her election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session and to \r\nwish her fruitful work. Her long experience, both as \r\nEcuador’s Ambassador to the United Nations and \r\nas Minister for Foreign Affairs, as well as her deep \r\nknowledge of the Organization, are valuable resources \r\nfor the United Nations.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino, which this year has \r\ntaken on the role of Vice-President of the General \r\nAssembly, supports the priorities of the President’s \r\nagenda, as set out in her inaugural statement (see A/73/\r\nPV.1), and believes that they provide an important \r\nand fundamental impetus to the necessary reforms \r\nconcerning the most important areas of the United \r\nNations activity. The San Marino delegation assures \r\nthe President of its fullest collaboration throughout the \r\nwork of the General Assembly.\r\nI would also like to express my country’s gratitude \r\nto the outgoing President, His Excellency Miroslav \r\nLajčák, for the important work he carried out during \r\nthe seventy-second session.\r\nMy country would also like to extend its special \r\nthanks to Secretary-General António Guterres for his \r\nenergy and determination in leading the United Nations \r\nand the reform processes of the Organization.\r\nThe theme chosen for this session, “Making the \r\nUnited Nations relevant to all people: global leadership \r\nand shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies”, is undoubtedly of great relevance. \r\nIt gives Member States the opportunity to contribute \r\nconstructively to the work of the General Assembly. \r\nThere is a strong correlation between the two concepts \r\nthat make up the subject of the debate: on the one hand, \r\nwhile the United Nations must be closer to the people of \r\nthe world by translating the fundamental principles of \r\nits global action into concrete results, it is essential, on \r\nthe other hand, not only to defend, but also to strengthen \r\ninternational cooperation and our Organization.\r\nRecent developments in the global sociopolitical \r\nlandscape have created obstacles to the development \r\nof multilateralism and are putting it at risk. Today, \r\nconsidering the magnitude of global challenges, their \r\nincreasingly evident interrelationships and the need \r\nfor Member States to work together to overcome \r\ndifficulties, it is more and more essential to adopt an \r\napproach based on common and coordinated policies, \r\nin one word, multilateralism.\r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 27/53\r\nThe Republic of San Marino has taken the decision \r\nto cooperate within the framework of international \r\nstructures and mechanisms, at the top of which is \r\nundoubtedly the United Nations, because it believes \r\nin the strength of dialogue, democracy and respect \r\nfor others. Indeed, the very peaceful coexistence of \r\npeoples relies on such values. My country believes that \r\nthe United Nations must increase its leadership role \r\nin the management of global governance, given to its \r\ndeeply democratic nature, its universal participation \r\nand undisputed legitimacy. The cultural diversity \r\nand traditions represented within the United Nations \r\nare not an obstacle, but rather an enormous asset, \r\nwhich makes it possible to adopt an approach that \r\nreconciles the interests of the international community \r\nand contributes to the attainment of human and \r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe cannot ignore the fact that in recent years other \r\nforums, such as the Group of Twenty, have been and \r\nare now exerting a great influence at the global level \r\nin the management of global governance. San Marino \r\nis grateful to those informal groups for the role that \r\nthey have played. However, in their decision-making \r\nprocess, those groups should be more transparent and \r\ninclusive and should take into account the interests, \r\nconcerns and aspirations of the countries that are \r\nexcluded, in particular the interests of developing \r\ncountries. The action of those informal groups must not \r\nbe in competition with, but should be complementary \r\nto that of the United Nations. Trust, inclusiveness \r\nand dialogue are essential elements in the support of \r\nmultilateralism and its ability to produce concrete \r\nresults at the global level.\r\nThis year’s theme is inevitably linked to the United \r\nNations reform process. That process is of fundamental \r\nimportance for the future world balance needed to \r\nensure international peace and security and must \r\nremain at the centre of all our efforts. The reforms must \r\nmake the structures of the Organization functional for \r\nthe objectives that it has set for its global action. The \r\ncredibility and authoritativeness of the United Nations \r\ndepend on its ability to transform objectives into \r\nconcrete actions that have a real and measurable impact \r\non peoples’ lives. The United Nations must be closer to \r\nthe people of the world, communicate better and show \r\nthem the importance and effectiveness of multilateral \r\ncollaboration for the lives of all citizens.\r\nIn that regard, the Republic of San Marino reiterates \r\nits support for the reform agenda that Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres is implementing in the fields of peace \r\nand security and management and in the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system. We are confident that those \r\nreforms will improve the United Nations contribution to \r\nsustainable development, ensure greater effectiveness \r\nin the resolution of armed conflicts and the search for \r\nsustainable peace, and ultimately strengthen the United \r\nNations system’s ability to produce more concrete and \r\nvisible results.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino expresses its concern \r\nabout the increasing number of conflicts in many \r\nparts of the world and supports the coordinated action \r\nof the United Nations in the fields of peacebuilding \r\nand peacekeeping. Religious radicalism, terrorism, \r\ntransnational organized crime, trafficking in drugs and \r\nhuman beings, weapons of mass destruction, violent \r\nextremism, marginalization and exclusion all pose a \r\nthreat to international peace and security.\r\nIt is essential to analyse the root causes of conflicts if \r\nwe want to promote disarmament and de-radicalization. \r\nAt the same time, we need to encourage, through \r\neducation, respect for and the promotion of human \r\nrights, the rule of law and access to justice.\r\nThe United Nations has often been criticized in \r\nrecent years for the inability of the Security Council to \r\nintervene adequately in various conflict situations, in \r\nparticular in Syria. Unfortunately, that has undermined \r\nthe credibility of our Organization. The Republic of \r\nSan Marino hopes that the Security Council will soon \r\nbe able to fulfil its mandate effectively. In that regard, \r\nand in order to support rapid and decisive action by \r\nthe Security Council, I am pleased to recall that my \r\ncountry has joined the code of conduct drawn up by \r\nthe Accountability, Coherence, Transparency group \r\nto refrain from using the veto in cases of crimes such \r\nas genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. \r\nSan Marino has also joined the joint proposal by France \r\nand Mexico for voluntary suspension of the veto by the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council.\r\nIn pursuing the goals of peacemaking and \r\nsustainable peace, the United Nations must promote a \r\nstrategic partnership in which Governments, the United \r\nNations system, international, regional and subregional \r\norganizations, civil society, the private sector and \r\nuniversities work together to achieve common goals. \r\nThe relationship between peace and development is \r\nclear: there can be no sustainable development without \r\npeace, just as there can be no peace without sustainable \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n28/53 18-30190\r\ndevelopment. In that regard, the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development becomes \r\nessential for the construction of inclusive, resilient and \r\npeaceful societies.\r\nThree years have passed since the adoption of the \r\n2030 Agenda. The international community is working \r\nhard to make the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nbecome a reality. While progress has been made in \r\nthe implementation of some of the Goals and targets, \r\nit should be noted that there are strong inequalities in \r\nthe implementation of the Agenda not only between \r\ncountries, but also within them. The Republic of San \r\nMarino underlines the central role played by the High-\r\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development in \r\nthe achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nthanks to its follow-up activity. In that context, San \r\nMarino supports the ministerial declaration that was \r\nadopted this year by the Forum.\r\nThe most difficult and important challenge to the \r\nachievement of the objective of sustainable development \r\nis the eradication of poverty in all its forms and \r\ndimensions, in particular extreme poverty. Although \r\nthe level of extreme poverty has fallen significantly in \r\nthe past 10 years, as shown by the data contained in the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on progress towards the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (E/2018/64), poverty \r\nremains, nevertheless, the main cause of hunger, and the \r\nnumber of undernourished people reached 815 million \r\nin 2016.\r\nThe Agenda emphasizes universal respect for \r\nhuman rights and human dignity and the fact that \r\npeace, justice, equality and non-discrimination are \r\nfundamental rights whose implementation becomes \r\nessential for the construction of inclusive societies.\r\nThe principle according to which no one should be \r\nleft behind requires the adoption of specific measures \r\nto support people in vulnerable situations. The 2030 \r\nAgenda takes into account the needs of children, young \r\npeople, people with disabilities, the elderly, indigenous \r\npeople, refugees, displaced persons, migrants and people \r\nliving in areas affected by humanitarian emergencies or \r\nin situations of armed conflict. Equal opportunities and \r\nrespect for cultural and ethnic diversity are central to \r\nthe full realization of human potential.\r\nThe promotion of actions in support of children \r\nand young people is a key element, since they must \r\ngrow up free from all forms of abuse and exploitation. \r\nUnfortunately, children pay a very high price in areas of \r\narmed conflict; many lose their lives or are kidnapped, \r\nraped, used as shields or recruited as soldiers. Moreover, \r\ntheir schools are often destroyed, as are their hospitals, \r\ndepriving them of their fundamental rights.\r\nMy country, which is a member of the Group of \r\nFriends on Children and Armed Conflict, believes that \r\ninternational humanitarian laws and human rights laws \r\nmust be respected in conflict situations. San Marino \r\nhas ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention \r\non the Rights of the Child on the involvement of \r\nchildren in armed conflicts, and it supports the Paris \r\nCommitments. Moreover, this year San Marino added \r\nits name to the list of countries supporting the Safe \r\nSchools Declaration, which is an important tool for the \r\nprotection of educational facilities from military use \r\nduring conflicts.\r\nOnly with the effective and full participation \r\nof women in decision-making processes that have a \r\ndirect impact on their lives will it be possible to build \r\nsustainable, resilient and inclusive societies. The \r\nRepublic of San Marino reaffirms its commitment to \r\nthe fight against all forms of gender-based violence, \r\nas well as all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation. \r\nThe objective of gender equality, the emancipation of \r\nwomen and girls, and the full realization of their human \r\nrights must be achieved. Gender equality must also be \r\ntranslated into equality in educational opportunities, \r\nwith particular regard to scientific subjects, because \r\ntechnology, science and innovation in general play \r\na vital role in meeting global challenges and in the \r\npromotion of sustainable development.\r\nAt the same time — and the Republic of San \r\nMarino is particularly convinced of this — the idea \r\nthat sustainable development can be achieved through \r\nnew technologies, science and innovation must be \r\ntransmitted through means of communication that \r\ndo not distort the truth, so as not to undermine the \r\nvery concept of freedom. In that regard, the Republic \r\nof San Marino is offering a concrete and motivated \r\ncontribution, also at the international level, on the \r\ntheme of correct information with the objective of \r\ncombating the increasingly dangerous phenomenon \r\nof fake news, which are deceptive, uncontrolled and \r\ncapable of inciting hatred and nurturing prejudices.\r\nThe commitment of the international community \r\nmust be directed towards all vulnerable groups without \r\nexception. People with disabilities and the elderly, for \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 29/53\r\nexample, must be ensured full participation in social, \r\neconomic and cultural life.\r\nThe effects of climate change represent one of \r\nthe greatest challenges of our time because of their \r\nunprecedented impact on our lives and, in particular, \r\non the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable. With an \r\naverage temperature rise of 1.1° C above pre-industrial \r\nlevels, 2017 was one of the hottest three years of all \r\ntime. The effects of climate change do not respect \r\nnational borders. They spread everywhere, in every \r\ncountry and continent. They are increasingly damaging \r\nnational economies, communities and countries. That \r\nis a global problem that requires solutions that need \r\nto be coordinated globally. Moreover, it is essential to \r\nstrengthen international cooperation in order to help \r\ndeveloping countries move towards a low-emission \r\neconomy.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino recognizes the deep \r\nsynergy between the implementation of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda \r\nand welcomes the recent entry into force of the \r\nagreement. Events related to climate change, such as \r\ndrought, which generates food and water shortages, \r\nhave increased competition for access to those and \r\nother natural resources. Conflicts are a major cause of \r\nfood insecurity. As a result, about 74 million people \r\ntoday are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe number of conflicts has increased over the past \r\ndecade and has led to the displacement of millions of \r\npeople. In 2017, 68 million people were forced to leave \r\ntheir homes. In addition to persecution and armed \r\nconflicts, natural disasters, such as f loods, earthquakes \r\nand hurricanes, partly resulting from the effects of \r\nclimate change, have forced millions of people to seek \r\nrefuge in other countries. Other disasters, such as \r\nsocioeconomic deprivation and the lack of food, water, \r\neducation and health, have led millions of people to \r\nseek their fortune elsewhere. All of that has contributed \r\nto an increase in migratory f lows, which is a major \r\nchallenge that the international community has been \r\nfacing for some years.\r\nSan Marino has followed the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations that led, at the end of July, to the \r\nfinalization of the global compact for safe, orderly and \r\nregular migration, which will be formally adopted in \r\nDecember during the intergovernmental conference on \r\nthe topic in Morocco. Given its transnational nature, \r\nno country can address the migration phenomenon on \r\nits own. The compact strengthens the universality of \r\nhuman rights, including the rights of migrants, their \r\ndignity, regardless of their status, and their entitlement \r\nto the satisfaction of basic rights, and their protection. \r\nIts objective is not to stop migration, but to manage \r\nit in the best possible way through strengthened \r\ninternational cooperation. My country believes that \r\nthe implementation of the compact will bring greater \r\nsecurity, order and economic progress for the benefit \r\nof all.\r\nThe global compact is a clear example of what \r\nmultilateralism can do and shows its potential and \r\nimportance, in similar fashion as do the recent 2030 \r\nAgenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and \r\nthe Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Indeed, through \r\ntangible measures aimed at financing development, the \r\ncompact lays the foundations for a global plan of action.\r\nIn order to deal with today’s global challenges, \r\nwe need a renewed commitment to multilateralism. \r\nThat is possible only through a strong United Nations \r\nOrganization, capable of coordinating, in an effective \r\nway, our economic, environmental and social policies \r\nat the global, regional and local levels.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the strong \r\nsupport of the Republic of San Marino for all initiatives \r\naimed at implementing the principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Alan Peter Cayetano, Secretary \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Philippines.\r\nMr. Cayetano (Philippines): There once was a \r\nwidow who suffered an injustice. She went to a judge \r\nand told him, “Judge, I have suffered an injustice. Give \r\nme justice.” The judge did nothing, so the next day she \r\nwent to his office. Still he did nothing, so she went to \r\nhis house during breakfast time and knocked on the \r\ndoor and said, “Judge, give me justice.” Still nothing \r\nhappened. Finally, she waited for him at night before \r\ndinnertime and still he would not see her. So, she went \r\nat midnight and knocked on his door and woke him up. \r\nFinally, the judge went out and told her, “You know, \r\nma’am, I do not fear God, nor do I fear man, but because \r\nof your persistence, I will give you justice.”\r\nWe all grew up with stories, anecdotes and \r\nparables — stories that give us hope, build our character \r\nand spark our determination to change the world. We \r\nare told those stories at home, in schools and in places \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n30/53 18-30190\r\nof worship. Thus, we come out of adolescence and enter \r\nadulthood with an idealism that makes us convinced \r\nthat we can change the world, that we are here to unite \r\nand not to divide, that we are here to heal and not to hurt.\r\nThat is the same spirit of idealism that we feel the \r\nfirst time we enter the United Nations. Unfortunately, \r\nas time goes by, many, if not most, of us are changed \r\nby the world. We become victims of pragmatism rather \r\nthan champions of idealism. As things get complicated \r\nand struggles get more difficult, we are tempted to \r\nsimply continue doing what is already being done and \r\naccept that we cannot solve the problem. When that \r\nhappens, we settle for a statement from the majority \r\nrather than a broad consensus on how to actually solve \r\nthe problem.\r\nThe story reminds us that persistence is good, \r\nbut it does not mean that we should be repetitive and \r\nsimply keep doing the same thing. Albert Einstein \r\ndefined stupidity as doing the same thing over and over \r\nagain and expecting different results. Certainly there \r\nis no stupidity in the United Nations, yet a tendency \r\nto just keep doing the same thing seems to plague us \r\nall. Trying new things is a challenge. It might or might \r\nnot work, but we should not be afraid of trying, nor \r\nshould we be afraid of failing. What we should fear is \r\nstagnation — that we as a community of nations end up \r\naccepting failure and making ourselves feel better by \r\ndoing something, even if that something is precisely the \r\nsame thing that failed to address the issues or solve the \r\nproblems in the first place.\r\nThe good news is that there is persistence in what \r\nwe call hope and idealism, in the aspiration of wanting \r\nto change the world. We teach our children to love God \r\nand to love our neighbour. But do we actually practice \r\nwhat we preach? So much inhumanity around the world \r\nhas been done in the name of God, and so little is being \r\ndone at times for our neighbours.\r\nWe live in a world that is fast becoming bigger, \r\nbut also constantly getting smaller. From families to \r\nclans, to tribes to a federation of tribes that we call a \r\nnation, now we are but one global village. And with \r\ntools like the Internet and social media, everything \r\nis known and communicated in real time. Nowadays \r\nwe are all neighbours, all members of the same global \r\ncommunity. We rise up together; we suffer together. \r\nBeing connected to each other all the time has \r\ntransformed the world into a global community, and we \r\nare all citizens of this world.\r\nToday, our social contract is no longer confined \r\nto our nation State. We should therefore exert efforts \r\nto connect, to emphasize commonalities and not \r\ndifferences, to think less that we are Filipinos, \r\nAmericans, Chinese, French or Russians, and to think \r\nof ourselves more as global citizens, the people of the \r\nUnited Nations. Yes, it is true that we need not always \r\nact with a united front, and we do not always have \r\nto act as a community. But neither can we ignore the \r\nfact that there are many problems that can be solved \r\nonly by a united global community. These can be \r\nissues relating to protecting the environment, extreme \r\nweather conditions, poverty and inequality, rule of law, \r\ncountering terrorism or violent extremism: those are \r\nproblems or challenges that we can only solve together. \r\nTogether we can find pragmatic idealism, which will \r\ngive us hope and the momentum to do more.\r\nIt is written: “Love thy neighbour”. Migration is \r\na reality. It is a fact. It is something that will continue \r\nto exist and even to grow. Issues relating to migration \r\ncannot be swept under the rug, but should be discussed \r\nopenly, frankly and thoroughly. The global compact for \r\nmigration is a huge step in the right direction, and that \r\nhuge step will be even bigger if we can get everyone \r\non board.\r\nAgain, “Love thy neighbour”, we are told. That \r\nseems like a simple command, and yet in a complex \r\nworld it is sometimes hard to carry out or implement. \r\nThat is why Filipinos thank Pope Francis, and we \r\nthank Secretary-General Guterres and all the countries \r\nthathave led and stood by the global compact. We thank \r\nmigrants around the world for inspiring us to have the \r\nfirst compact negotiated at the intergovernmental level \r\nto cover, in a holistic and comprehensive manner, all \r\ndimensions of international migration.\r\nThe Philippines, under the leadership of President \r\nRodrigo Roa Duterte, is one with the United Nations \r\nin being uncompromising on the issues of the rule of \r\nlaw, just and equitable peace, which leads to order, \r\ndevelopment and prosperity, and the protection of each \r\nand every human being’s rights. As a sovereign and \r\ndemocratic country led by a duly elected President, we \r\nare on track to salvage our deteriorating country from \r\nbecoming a narco-State or a State held hostage by the \r\nrich and powerful, who ignore the plight of the poor, \r\npowerless and marginalized.\r\nThe hunger for change, peace, and law and order \r\nis genuine. There is passion to improve our economy, \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 31/53\r\nso that the more than 10 million Filipinos abroad can \r\nchoose whether to work at home or abroad and not \r\nbe forced by poverty or the lack of quality jobs to go \r\nabroad to find high-paying jobs at the cost of leaving \r\ntheir country and separating from their families. Those \r\nwho stay at home can, at the very least, live a safe and \r\ncomfortable life.\r\nWe may somehow and sometimes differ in how we \r\nexpress ourselves; yet that should not be interpreted \r\nas turning our backs on the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights. On the contrary, the Philippines and \r\nPresident Duterte are instituting all of those reforms \r\nso as to be able to protect the rights of every single \r\nFilipino and every single human being living in the \r\nPhilippines — yes, the rights of all Filipinos and all \r\nhuman beings, if that is at all possible. But in cases \r\nwhere we have to choose between protecting the rights \r\nof a law-abiding citizen and the law enforcer versus the \r\ndrug lord or criminal who seeks to kill and destroy, it is \r\nclear that we will protect the former — the law enforcer \r\nand the law-abiding citizen. Would Members of the \r\nUnited Nations not do the same? Which country, which \r\nleader would not do the same? Who would not protect \r\ntheir citizens and their law enforcers?\r\nChallenges will always be there, but so will hope! \r\nHope leads to faith, and faith combined with action \r\nproduces miracles. The United Nations is the place, \r\nthe venue of great opportunity for adding action to our \r\nfaith and for changing the world for the better. That is, \r\nof course, provided we can transcend our personal and \r\nsometimes national interest for the interest of the global \r\ncommunity or, simply put, work for the greater good. \r\nFaith without action is dead. The United Nations is not \r\na place to bury our dead; it is a place to rise up, to \r\nresurrect our hopes and to dream of a better world.\r\nThe President of the General Assembly, Ms. Maria \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés, provides us with hope and \r\nsomething to aspire to, as seen in this year’s theme: \r\n“Making the United Nations relevant to all people: \r\nglobal leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. Making \r\nthe United Nations relevant to all is difficult. It is a \r\ndream; yet it is a dream worth fighting for. The Filipino \r\npeople will remain persistent in our quest for peace, \r\norder, development and prosperity, and in the quest \r\nfor a safe and comfortable life for all those living in \r\nthe Philippines. We will continue to have faith but will \r\nadd actions to our faith, and we will continue to love \r\nour nation and not only preach but actually do what \r\nwe preach.\r\nAnd finally, we would like to close our statement \r\nby expressing our sincere and profound gratitude to \r\nall the countries and peoples that have assisted us, \r\nstood with us and lifted us up when we needed it most. \r\nGod bless all present. God bless all the peoples of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non Her Excellency Ms. Karin Kneissl, Federal Minister \r\nfor Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Austria.\r\nMs. Kneissl (Austria) (spoke in Arabic): I am present \r\nhere in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nAustria. I extend my greetings to the President and the \r\nVice-President of the General Assembly.\r\nI am the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria, \r\nbut I would like to address the Assembly in Arabic. \r\nWhy do I do so? For one thing, Arabic is one of the \r\nsix official languages of the United Nations. I studied \r\nArabic at the United Nations Office in Vienna. Arabic \r\nis a important and beautiful language, as well as part of \r\nthe important Arab civilization.\r\nI also learned in Lebanon during the years of war \r\nhow people continue with their lives despite all odds \r\nand difficulties. That is the secret of life. There are men \r\nand women from Baghdad to Damascus who manage \r\nto just continue with their lives. I totally respect those \r\npeople. All of us are the offspring of Adam. The \r\noffspring of Adam means humankind. In this Hall we \r\nhave a voice, and we should use it to express the voice \r\nof those outside this Hall who are living in conflicts \r\nand wars, especially in the Middle East.\r\nAllow me to mention the German writer, Bertolt \r\nBrecht, who said that there are some in the darkness \r\nand others in the light. We see only those in the light; \r\nwe do not see those in the darkness.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI just quoted the German writer Bertolt Brecht, \r\nwho spoke of those who are in the darkness and those \r\nwho are in the light. We only see those in the light. \r\nUnfortunately, we diplomats often fail to make heard \r\nthe voices of those who are in the shadows and in \r\nmisery. Our diplomatic practices all too often favour \r\nfine declarations over real actions. I even dare to \r\nsay that we indulge in a kind of dialogue of the deaf \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n32/53 18-30190\r\nwhen we reduce ourselves to a ritual of reading out \r\nour prefabricated notes. That state of mind reflects a \r\nloss of the sense of reality. We have lost the sense of \r\nany real exchange of views. When we speak, are we \r\nstill discussing? Do we even know how to look in each \r\nother’s eyes?\r\nAlbert Cohen, a connoisseur of the League of \r\nNations, the organization that preceded the United \r\nNations, wrote in Geneva his masterpiece Belle du \r\nSeigneur, whose main character is named Solal, a \r\ngentleman who works as the Assistant Secretary-\r\nGeneral of that organization. Finally, that gentleman \r\nloses his post of Assistant Secretary-General at the \r\nLeague of Nations because he forgets his diplomatic \r\nrestraint in the face of the persecution of German \r\nJews in the 1930s. Has anyone here ever experienced \r\nthe feeling of losing face when confronted with \r\ninjustice and indifference? The multilateralism we are \r\ncelebrating here is a sophisticated form of diplomacy. \r\nWe have a wide range of instruments: our contracts, \r\nour conventions and our declarations. But where is the \r\neffectiveness of that multilateralism?\r\nAllow me at this point to pay tribute to President \r\nMacron’s statement to the Assembly earlier this week \r\n(see A/73/PV.6), which contains a very interesting \r\nreflection on multilateralism and the rule of law. \r\nFor the President of France, those two things are \r\nsynonymous. However, multilateralism is often blurred \r\nin a merry-go-round of meetings of which certain \r\nwell-to-do diplomats have made a comfortable, subtle, \r\ninterminable game that is enriched with litanies and \r\nmantras.\r\nUnfortunately, we are content with this mantra when \r\nwe talk about Syria and Yemen. We become intoxicated \r\nwith words like “reconstruction”, “stabilization”, \r\n“constitution”, and so on. But faced with all that, the \r\npopulations, the children, seek only to survive. They \r\nneed bread, drinking water, a few hours of electricity \r\nand a minimum of security. That is why, beyond those \r\nfine phrases, Austria wishes to contribute, as other \r\ncountries already do, to financing the demining of \r\nSyrian territory. And with regard to the greatest tragedy \r\nof our time — and here I speak of Yemen — Austria is \r\nready to increase its humanitarian commitment.\r\nBut let us come back from the action on the ground \r\nto the beautiful Hall in which we find ourselves on \r\nthis beautiful Saturday. Multilateralism is based on a \r\ndiplomatic approach to norms, and it is those norms that \r\nrequire us to condemn, in the name of universal values, \r\nthe use of chemical weapons in Syria and elsewhere. \r\nThey also demand the absolute rejection of biological \r\nweapons. In that vein, there is no reason why we should \r\nnot categorically prohibit the production and use of \r\nnuclear weapons and explosives.\r\nDisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control \r\nare essential for global security. The fiftieth anniversary \r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) reminds us of the key role of the rule \r\nof law. Despite some success, the NPT has suffered \r\nfrom inadequate implementation. Now, what is the law? \r\nIt consists of binding rules of an enforceable nature. \r\nLike other international treaties, disarmament treaties \r\nare not of a moral but rather of a legal nature. We are \r\nconvinced that if we wish to really move towards nuclear \r\ndisarmament, the ratification of the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is of paramount importance. \r\nMy country, Austria, has been chosen as the seat of the \r\norganization responsible for the implementation of that \r\ntreaty, and we are proud of that.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\n The destructive power of nuclear weapons has \r\nmade it imperative that the legal prohibition of nuclear \r\nwar be strictly observed in practice. We congratulate \r\nLatin America for creating the first international \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nWe all know that, according to the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, there is no just war. In 1945, \r\nthe international community set out to save future \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war. Unfortunately, \r\nthe United Nations has not succeeded in keeping \r\nthat promise.\r\nIn addition, the majority of Latin American \r\nStates have, as Austria has also done, recognized the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of \r\nJustice. That is a necessary condition for maintaining a \r\ncredible system of international law. Similarly, Austria \r\nis a firm supporter of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. We are celebrating the twentieth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of the Rome Statute this year. The \r\nestablishment of a permanent independent tribunal \r\nfor the prosecution of the most serious crimes was a \r\nhistoric milestone. We welcome the activation of the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, \r\nwhich has been in effect since July and is an important \r\nstep in combating impunity. We regret, however, that \r\nthe jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court has \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 33/53\r\nbeen undermined by several agreements impeding the \r\nsurrender of persons to the Court.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe main purpose of the International Court \r\nof Justice is to foster trust in the international legal \r\nsystem. Secretary-General Guterres spoke at length \r\n(see A/73/PV.6) about the broken trust that we face. \r\nThe most recent example of the importance of trust \r\nand reliability in international relations concerns the \r\nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which \r\nis politically but not legally binding. The JCPOA, \r\nnegotiated in Vienna, was the result of effective \r\nmultilateral action. It contains a set of political \r\ncommitments and includes, importantly, an independent \r\nverification system involving the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency. That agreement demonstrates the \r\nimportance of pacta sunt servanda — agreements \r\nmust be kept — which many of us recall from our \r\ninternational law studies. That is a precondition \r\nfor mutual trust and confidence-building in the \r\ninternational arena. Preserving the nuclear deal with \r\nIran is a matter of respecting international agreements \r\nand one, in the end, of international security. If one \r\ncountry that originally committed to the JCPOA can \r\nwalk away from the agreement without other parties \r\nto the agreement having violated it, mutual trust is \r\nweakened. Reliability is key to peaceful solutions of \r\nconflicts. That is especially true with regard to long-\r\nterm conflicts such as the one on the Korean peninsula, \r\nwhere concrete and substantive measures should follow \r\nthe first encouraging steps. We express our sincere \r\nrespect for all those involved in that process.\r\nMultilateralism has also failed several million \r\nwomen worldwide, as have individual States. Gender \r\nequality is about more than legal provisions. It is about \r\ndaily practice in our countries and societies. That \r\nis why the fight against discrimination against and \r\nimproving the situation of women and girls worldwide \r\nhas been a long-standing concern of Austrian foreign \r\nand development policy. Our focus is centred on the \r\nwomen and peace and security agenda, the political \r\nand economic empowerment of women and the fight \r\nagainst gender-based violence, with a particular focus \r\non combating female genital mutilation. More than \r\n200 million women and girls worldwide are victims of \r\nsuch mutilation.\r\nTogether, we must stand up against that humiliation, \r\nwhich is a breach of human rights and an appalling \r\nviolation of the physical integrity of girls and women. \r\nIn 2018, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs \r\nearmarked more than €1 million to help victims of \r\nfemale genital mutilation through surgical restoration, \r\nas their physical integrity can be restored. Here in New \r\nYork, I had very constructive talks with the United \r\nNations Population Fund and UNICEF for the purpose \r\nof joining forces to advocate for the basic rights and \r\nphysical integrity of girls and women. We aim to do \r\nthat not only through conferences and seminars, but \r\nalso through practical surgical help, whereby help truly \r\nbecomes effectual. Women and children are also among \r\nthe vulnerable victims of human trafficking. Illegal \r\nmigration provides daily illustrations of that tragedy, \r\nwith which we are familiar in the North-South and \r\nEast-West contexts.\r\nVienna has found its specific identity within the \r\nUnited Nations family, in particular in the fight against \r\norganized crime, corruption and terrorism. Next year, \r\nVienna will celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations Office at Vienna. \r\nI am part of that generation of Austrians who grew \r\nup with the proud awareness of living in a United \r\nNations city.\r\nWith this statement, I have tried to depart a \r\nlittle bit from the usual United Nations discourse. I \r\nhave refrained from addressing every single issue \r\ndealt with by the United Nations system. However, I \r\ncannot conclude without endorsing Secretary-General \r\nGuterres’ foremost concern, namely, climate change. \r\nThe global energy mix continues to be dominated by \r\nfossil fuels, in particular coal. Scientists are working \r\non finding new forms of energy, in particular for \r\ntransportation. Will we see an increase in electric and \r\nother types of engines? Innovation, market forces and \r\npolitical action will decide.\r\nIt is in the Middle East that the major oil reserves \r\nare located. The States of the Middle East were shaped \r\nby the oil business in the aftermath of the First World \r\nWar. This autumn, we are commemorating the end of the \r\nGreat War 100 years ago. Let me remind the Assembly \r\nthat, with the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, the \r\nnew map of the Middle East was shaped by pipelines, \r\nin relation to which borders were subsequently drawn. \r\nThe recent wars imposed on the Middle East were also \r\nfought for the sake of oil. Now Syria is a victim of the \r\ninstability created by all those wars. A week ago, a \r\nceasefire was brokered in northern Syria for the city of \r\nIdlib. Five national armies find themselves in a sort of \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n34/53 18-30190\r\nstand-off among millions of civilians and thousands of \r\nterrorists, some of whom are European Union nationals, \r\nor, as we call them, “foreign fighters”.\r\nThe burning issue is how to move from that military \r\nsituation to a diplomatic transition. The time has come \r\nto take courageous steps to launch such a process. \r\nWe believe that there is momentum for creating a \r\nnew dynamic. We encourage the decision makers \r\nfrom Washington, D.C., to Moscow, from Tehran to \r\nJerusalem, and from Ankara to Damascus to seize \r\nthat very momentum. We have a historic chance, and, \r\nthere is no other alternative — according to the Hebrew \r\nexpression — than to sit down at the negotiation table.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French) I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Shaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed \r\nAl-Khalifa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain.\r\nShaikh Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAt the outset, allow me to sincerely congratulate the \r\nPresident and her friendly country, the Republic of \r\nEcuador, on her election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session. The fact that \r\nshe holds that important position is a reflection of her \r\nskill and merit. I also sincerely thank her predecessor, \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák, for his valued efforts in \r\nconducting the work of the previous session in a highly \r\nprofessional manner.\r\nI also wish to express the great appreciation of \r\nthe Kingdom of Bahrain to the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. António Guterres, for his tireless efforts to reform \r\nthe Organization’s structure and enhance its role in the \r\nfields of sustainable development, conflict resolution, \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nand many other human issues of interest to all States \r\nof the world. Those efforts are tangible and enjoy our \r\nfull support. I would like as well to recall with great \r\nappreciation the role of the late diplomat and former \r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, and his endeavours \r\nto reform the Organization and work out solutions to \r\ninternational crises. I offer my sincerest condolences \r\nto his family and the international community at large.\r\nUnder the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad \r\nbin Isa Al Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain and with \r\nthe support of the Prime Minister, His Royal Highness \r\nPrince Khalifa Bin Salman Al Khalifa, and the Crown \r\nPrince and Deputy Supreme Commander and First \r\nDeputy Prime Minister, His Royal Highness Prince \r\nSalman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nis keen to implement programmes and plans of all kinds \r\nto raise the standard of living and development for its \r\ncitizens and residents, in keeping up with international \r\nefforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand take advanced steps in that regard so that everyone \r\ncan enjoy a decent living and a secure life.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain has for many years been \r\nclassified as a highly advanced country with regard to \r\nhuman development. It has succeeded in mitigating the \r\nimpact of economic challenges thanks to its economic \r\ndiversification efforts, its fiscal and monetary policies, \r\nand its investment incentives. That has had a positive \r\nimpact on the Bahraini economy, which is now classified \r\nby the International Monetary Fund as one of the fastest \r\n-growing economies in the region. The discovery of \r\nthe largest oil and natural-gas reserves since their first \r\ndiscovery and production in the Kingdom of Bahrain in \r\n1932 will, God willing, constitute a strong impetus for \r\nBahrain’s economy in the future.\r\nAs part of the cooperation with the United Nations, \r\nHis Royal Highness the Prime Minister issued a \r\ndecree establishing the Follow-up and Coordination \r\nCommittee between the Kingdom of Bahrain and the \r\nUnited Nations agencies as an outcome of the strategic \r\npartnership for the years 2018-2020. An agreement to \r\nthat effect was signed by both parties to support the \r\nefforts of the Kingdom to achieve its development \r\nobjectives and the Sustainable Development Goals, in \r\nline with the Bahrain Economic Vision 2030.\r\nDetermined to highlight and document those \r\nefforts, my Government presented a few weeks ago its \r\nfirst voluntary national review on the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. That was \r\ndone here in New York during the participation of \r\nmy Government in the high-level political forum on \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe election of the Kingdom of Bahrain to \r\nmembership in the Committee on Non-Governmental \r\nOrganizations for the period 2019-2022 reflects \r\ninternational appreciation for the policies pursued by \r\nHis Majesty the King to strengthen rights and liberties \r\nand to support common efforts to achieve the objectives \r\nand purposes of the United Nations. Consistent with its \r\nefforts to continue its international contributions and \r\nits determination to cooperate with various organs of \r\nthe United Nations, the Kingdom of Bahrain submitted \r\nfor the third time its candidature for membership in \r\nthe Human Rights Council for the period 2019-2021. \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 35/53\r\nThat candidature reaffirms our policy of enhancing \r\nrespect for human rights and maintaining freedoms, in \r\nline with international standards and building on the \r\nprogress already achieved in that field.\r\nLast March, during the sixty-second session of \r\nthe Commission on the Status of Women, nominations \r\nwere solicited at the United Nations for the Princess \r\nSabeeka bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa Global Award for \r\nWomen’s Empowerment. The Award aims to highlight \r\nachievements in the field of the protection of equal \r\nopportunities for women and men in the world. The \r\nKingdom of Bahrain ranks as a Tier 1 country in the \r\nreport on trafficking in persons issued by the United \r\nStates State Department in June, making us the first \r\ncountry in the Middle East and North Africa to attain that \r\nhigh status and confirming the great accomplishments \r\nof the Kingdom of Bahrain in that field. Tribute was \r\nalso paid by the State Department to Mr. Osama bin \r\nAbdullah Al-Absi, Chief Executive Officer of the \r\nLabour Market Regulatory Authority and Chairman \r\nof the National Committee to Combat Trafficking in \r\nPersons in the Kingdom of Bahrain — out of a total \r\nof 10international personalities — in appreciation \r\nof his extraordinary contribution to the fight against \r\ntrafficking in persons.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is always looking to \r\ncontribute to the achievement of a more prosperous \r\nfuture for the peoples of the world. We are fully \r\naware of the importance of alliances for preserving \r\nregional security and for decisively addressing the \r\nchallenges and threats to the stability of countries and \r\nthe development and prosperity of peoples, particularly \r\nin the Arab Gulf region, which is considered a central \r\nregion in the Middle East and the world.\r\nWe therefore believe that achieving lasting \r\nsecurity, stable peace and sustainable development in \r\nthe countries of the region is a collective responsibility \r\nthat requires building a robust political, economic and \r\nmilitary alliance among responsible countries in that \r\nregion. Those countries must understand the current \r\nthreats and the requirements for the future while having \r\na genuine desire, serious will and wise policies that \r\nmake them indispensable countries for shouldering such \r\nresponsibility in collaboration with allied countries. \r\nThat would help to safeguard the security and safety \r\nof countries and peoples, and deter whoever might be \r\ntempted to threaten the stability of that strategic region \r\nof the world.\r\nThat region is confronted with many dangers, \r\nnotably from the regime in Iran with its policy \r\nof destroying and overthrowing States and their \r\ninstitutions, while supporting terrorist and extremist \r\ngroups and interfering in the internal affairs of other \r\nStates. The regime in Iran falsely accuses neighbouring \r\ncountries of instigating events that take place in Iran. \r\nIt seeks to impose its hegemony on the region by \r\npackaging and exporting its miserable revolution, while \r\nthe Iranian people suffers from its tyranny, oppression \r\nand injustice. It disseminates an extremist ideology that \r\nhas become a constant feature of its foreign policy, and it \r\nthreatens the aspirations and ambitions of peoples who \r\nhave coexisted for many centuries. We ourselves have \r\ncoexisted with Iran and its friendly people, who have \r\nan ancient civilization. We were living side byside in \r\nan environment of shared heritage, culture, commerce \r\nand other aspects.\r\nThe situation in the Republic of Yemen is a case in \r\npoint. The Iranian regime supports the militias behind \r\nthe coup d’état in Yemen, allowing them to continue their \r\ncriminal and hostile actions that threaten neighbouring \r\ncountries through the launching of ballistic missiles \r\nagainst civilian-populated areas in the Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia. That has been confirmed by major \r\ncountries that are working to achieve security in the \r\nregion and the reports of the United Nations, including \r\nthe fifth report of the Secretary-General (S/2018/602) \r\non the implementation of resolution 2231 (2015). They \r\nclearly indicate that Iran is the origin of those missiles, \r\nwhich constitute serious threats to security and stability \r\nin the region and to the major international shipping \r\nlanes, the Strait of Hormuz and Bab Al-Mandab.\r\nAt a time when it is imperative to establish common \r\nmechanisms for collective security in the Middle East, \r\nwe are confronted with another source of impediment to \r\nthose efforts, namely, Qatar, whose actions threaten the \r\nsecurity and stability of the region. Qatar maintains its \r\npolicies and practices, which run against the concept of \r\ncollective security through a dangerous approach aimed \r\nat spreading and fuelling terrorism and at toppling \r\nnational Governments while striving to destroy them \r\nand dump them into chaos.\r\nMy country was a target of Qatari plans, which \r\nwere not limited to the events of 2011, when Qatar \r\nprovided financial, informational and logistical support \r\nfor acts of violence and terrorism. Furthermore, Qatar \r\nhas throughout its history attacked its neighbours \r\nrepeatedly, including our territory in 1937 and 1986 and \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n36/53 18-30190\r\nthe borders of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1992. \r\nWe reacted with wisdom and foresight to prevent our \r\nrespective peoples from experiencing any harm. We and \r\nthe Qataris are one people. We were once under a single \r\nleadership, and we are united by origin, family ties, \r\nhistory, objective and a common destiny. Our relations \r\nwill remain close and impervious to all attempts to stir \r\nup strife or alter that everlasting reality.\r\nWe still hope that Qatar will return to its senses and \r\nprove its good intentions and desire to become a positive \r\nmember of the region by responding to the demands of \r\nthe Kingdom of Bahrain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, \r\nthe United Arab Emirates and the Arab Republic of \r\nEgypt. Those demands are consistent with the solid \r\nbasis of international law, good-neighbourliness, \r\nmutual respect and the respect of the sovereignty and \r\nindependence of States. They seek to put an end to \r\nthe support and financing of terrorism by Qatar, and \r\nto have Qatar implement its commitments under the \r\nagreements that it has signed, notably the 2013 Riyadh \r\nAgreement and its implementation mechanism, and the \r\nsubsequent 2014 supplementary agreement.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is working to put into action \r\nthe various frameworks for constructive cooperation \r\nwith its partners and friends around the world. We \r\nparticipate effectively in many alliances, including \r\nthe Islamic Military Counter-Terrorism Coalition, \r\nthe Global Coalition against Da’esh and the Arab \r\nCoalition to Restore Legitimacy in Yemen. We reiterate \r\nour support for all initiatives aimed at establishing \r\npeace and security in the world — particularly in our \r\nregion — beginning with the efforts of the United States \r\nof America under the leadership of President Donald \r\nTrump, the most important aspects of which are to work \r\nwith the countries of the region to establish a Middle \r\nEast strategic alliance, to classify certain terrorist \r\ngroups that are supported by the Iranian regime and \r\nincluded on the United States Government’s lists of \r\nterrorist organizations, and to implement the United \r\nStates strategy vis-à-vis the Iranian regime, including \r\nthe withdrawal from the incomplete nuclear agreement \r\nwith Iran. We express our commitment to working \r\nwith our allies to support the security and stability of \r\nthe region.\r\nIn that regard, we renew our demand for an end \r\nto Iran’s occupation of the three United Arab Emirates \r\nislands — Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu \r\nMusa — and for Iran to respond seriously to the efforts \r\nof the United Arab Emirates to restore sovereignty over \r\nits territory and resolve the issue through negotiations \r\nor referral to the International Court of Justice.\r\nI would be remiss if I did not commend the significant \r\nrole and constructive efforts of the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia at the regional and international levels, using \r\nits prominent status and strategic role to consolidate \r\ninternational peace and security. The Custodian of the \r\nTwo Holy Mosques, King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al \r\nSaud of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, sponsored an \r\nagreement on peace between the Republic of Eritrea \r\nand the Democratic Federal republic of Ethiopia.\r\nThe preservation of the State and its institutions is \r\nthe main guarantee of the stability of peoples and the \r\nrevival of communities aimed at preventing them from \r\nfalling into the abyss of anarchy and terrorism. I want \r\nto recall the words of President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi of \r\nthe Arab Republic of Egypt in his statement before the \r\nGeneral Assembly a few days ago:\r\n“[T]here is no way to achieve an effective \r\ninternational order if its main constituent unit, the \r\nnation State, which is premised on the notions of \r\ncitizenship, democracy and equality, is threatened \r\nwith disintegration....The disintegration of nations \r\nas a result of civil strife and regression to sectarian \r\nloyalty rather than national identity is responsible \r\nfor the most dangerous phenomena in our \r\ncontemporary world”. (A/73/PV.7, p. 8)\r\nIn line with that consistent position, we reaffirm \r\nthe need for a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis with \r\neffective Arab participation and a strong Arab role so \r\nthat that State can exercise control and sovereignty \r\nover the totality of its territory and eliminate terrorist \r\ngroups of all kinds, particularly those supported by \r\nIran, such as Hizbullah and others. We also stress the \r\nneed to prevent regional interference, which harms \r\nSyria’s present and future, and the need to realize the \r\naspirations of the Syrian people for a peaceful and \r\nstable life. We welcome the agreement between Russia \r\nand Turkey and reaffirm our support for the efforts \r\nof Mr. Staffan de Mistura, the Special Envoy of the \r\nSecretary-General for Syria.\r\nWith regard to the Republic of Yemen, the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain has been committed to getting involved \r\nas an active member of the Arab coalition to restore \r\nlegitimacy in Yemen since its inception. The coalition \r\nis committed to restoring peace and security in Yemen \r\nand to assisting the brotherly people of Yemen in all \r\nhumanitarian areas. The coalition is moving forward in \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 37/53\r\nits mission to guarantee Yemen’s unity, independence \r\nand territorial integrity and to put an end to foreign \r\ninterference in its internal affairs, notably the serious \r\ninterventions by the Iranian regime, until a political \r\nsolution is reached with the participation of all, based \r\non the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council and its \r\nimplementation mechanism, as well as the outcomes of \r\nthe national dialogue and Security Council resolution \r\n2216 (2015).\r\nIf we really want to have peace and security \r\nthroughout the Middle East, Jerusalem must remain \r\nthe historic symbol of coexistence and harmony among \r\nreligions, as it always has been. The continuation of the \r\nconflict in Palestine is not an unavoidable destiny, and \r\nthe achievement of peace is an attainable objective. We \r\nmust therefore exert further efforts to reach a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace that offers the Palestinian people, \r\nlike all other peoples, the right to a decent life and an \r\nindependent and sovereign State, with the borders of \r\n4 June 1967 and with East Jerusalem as its capital and \r\nthe right that guarantees the return of refugees on the \r\nbasis of the two-State solution, in accordance with the \r\nArab Peace Initiative and relevant resolutions of the \r\ninternational legitimacy. We stress the importance of \r\nnot altering the legal status of East Jerusalem and the \r\nneed for the international community to act in order \r\nto put an end to all Israeli measures concerning the \r\ninhabitants of Jerusalem, their sacred sites and places \r\nof worship. We also underscore the need to offer all \r\npossible assistance to the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\nin order to preserve that United Nations agency and \r\nenable it to continue to discharge its noble duties.\r\nPeace and stability in the Republic of Iraq and the \r\nmaintenance of its sovereignty and the prosperity of its \r\npeople are what we wish for that sincere Arab country. \r\nWe are hopeful that Iraq will resume its leading role in \r\nthe Arab, regional and international arena. We stress \r\nthe need to put an end to regional interference in its \r\ninternal affairs, particularly by the Iranian regime and \r\nits various agents, notably armed militias and terrorist \r\norganizations and groups, so that Iraq’s brotherly \r\npeople can enjoy security and prosperity.\r\nWith regard to Libya, we reiterate the consistent \r\nposition of the Kingdom of Bahrain, which is to support \r\nall efforts towards the reconstruction of the State and \r\nthe unification of the military institution so that it can \r\nprotect and defend Libya and confront all forms of \r\nterrorism, preserve the unity and territorial integrity of \r\nthe country and meet the aspirations of the brotherly \r\nLibyan people to achieve stability, development \r\nand progress.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain supports the sisterly \r\nKingdom of Morocco against the f lagrant Iranian \r\nplotting and interference in its internal affairs, and \r\nwe stand behind the serious and credible efforts by \r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco to reach a political solution \r\nto the issue of the Western Sahara on the basis of the \r\nMoroccan initiative of autonomy and the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and within the framework \r\nof the sovereignty, national unity and territorial \r\nintegrity of the Kingdom of Morocco.\r\nThe Assembly’s choice of the theme of this \r\nsession, “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies” \r\nsends one message, namely, that if those objectives are \r\nrealized, then we would have achieved the purposes \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and attained our \r\ndesired goals. The Kingdom of Bahrain believes in this \r\nmessage and implements it while it continues on its \r\ndevelopment path. It perseveres in its efforts to enhance \r\nthe security and stability of its people, and will never \r\nabandon its role in the strengthening of tolerance, the \r\nvalues of coexistence and the principles of dialogue \r\nbetween States, peoples, cultures and religions.\r\nWe all witnessed the high-level meeting convened \r\nhere in New York by the King Hamad Global Centre \r\nfor Peaceful Coexistence on achieving peaceful and \r\ninclusive communities in accordance with Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 16. We also witnessed the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain Forum, held under the theme “Common \r\nvisions for a successful future: national, regional and \r\nglobal challenges and opportunities”. Those initiatives \r\nreflect the State of Bahrain’s policies and its faith in \r\npartnerships and cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity, which seeks to overcome all challenges.\r\nA State based on an open and diverse society that \r\nwelcomes all who set foot on its land and live among its \r\npeople offers — and has always offered — a successful \r\nmodel to be followed. A State that has achieved all that \r\nit has achieved within such rich diversity and positive \r\nopenness can only remain faithful to all international \r\ncovenants and conventions. That is the model of a \r\nState that cares for the interests of its people and the \r\nregion to which it belongs. Its approach will continue \r\nto be based on the commitment of everybody to good-\r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n38/53 18-30190\r\nneighbourliness, mutual respect and to refraining from \r\ninflicting harm on others or jeopardizing their security.\r\nAs for those who go astray and revoke their \r\ncovenant and those who dissent from those principles \r\nand frameworks, the implementation of international \r\nlaw ensures the security and stability of our States \r\nand a return to normality for the sake of a stable and \r\nprosperous environment that consists of peaceful \r\ncountries and reassured peoples in a prosperous and \r\ncoexisting world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Ezéchiel Nibigira, Minister for \r\nExternal Relations and International Cooperation of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi.\r\nMr. Nibigira (Burundi) (spoke in French): First \r\nof all, allow me to give thanks to Almighty God, who \r\nhas enabled us to meet in the magnificent city of New \r\nYork, which is hosting the seventy-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly of our Organization.\r\nAllow me also to offer the President the sincerest \r\ngreetings of His Excellency Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Burundi, who was unable \r\nto make the trip to New York and has honoured me \r\nwith the task of representing him. My delegation would \r\nlike to add its voice to all those who preceded it in \r\nthis forum to extend to Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa \r\nGarcés our warm and heartfelt congratulations on her \r\nbrilliant election as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-third session. As the fourth woman to \r\nassume that position out of 73 Presidents of the General \r\nAssembly, we have no doubt that she will utilize her \r\nfeminine touch to make this session a resounding \r\nsuccess. Naturally, she can count on Burundi’s full \r\nsupport and cooperation throughout her term.\r\nMy delegation also takes this opportunity to pay a \r\nfitting tribute to her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, \r\nfor leading the work of the seventy-second session and \r\nhelping us to achieve such brilliant results. We also \r\nthank the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, for \r\nthe commendable actions he has already undertaken in \r\nthe short time since he assumed his role at the helm of \r\nour Organization.\r\nMy delegation is deeply saddened by the death of \r\nthe late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. His \r\ndeath is an irreparable loss for all Africans and the \r\nentire United Nations family. We pay tribute to him for \r\nhis tireless work and dedication to the cause of world \r\npeace and development.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the choice of the central \r\ntheme of this session, namely, “Making the United \r\nNations relevant to all people: global leadership and \r\nshared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies”. That is a timely theme, as the \r\nfragmentation and polarization of the world threatens \r\nthe multilateralism that we desire and which is based \r\non respect for the rule of law and the sharing of \r\nresponsibilities in managing global issues.\r\nFor most of my statement, I will focus on the general \r\nsituation in my country, Burundi, before addressing \r\nthe current global challenges, whose solutions require \r\nconcerted responses. At the political level, on May 17 \r\nBurundi organized a constitutional referendum, which \r\nproceeded in  a calm and orderly manner. That event \r\nwas preceded by very broad consultations with the \r\npopulation, which enabled them to express themselves \r\nin all their rich political, ethnic, regional and gender \r\ndiversity — and in complete transparency — regarding \r\nthe content of the new basic law.\r\nMember States will recall that, when the new \r\nConstitution was enacted on 7 June, the President of \r\nthe Republic of Burundi informed citizens and the \r\ninternational community that his second term of office \r\nwould end in 2020 and that he was ready to support the \r\nnew President, who will be elected that year. Contrary \r\nto the discourse of some who had claimed that his \r\nintentions were to shape the new Constitution for his \r\nown benefit and to remain in power until 2034, that \r\ngesture of high political and democratic value on the \r\npart of our President sets a welcome example.\r\nAlso at the political level, it would not be \r\nsuperfluous to underline that the spirit of tolerance, \r\ntransparency and openness of the political space is \r\ncontinually being strengthened in Burundi. That is \r\nevidenced by the return and reintegration of the several \r\nthousand refugees and political leaders who had f led \r\nthe country and who can now enjoy their civil and \r\npolitical rights without any hindrance. The liberation \r\nof more than 2,000 prisoners at the beginning of the \r\nyear also formed part of that dynamic of reconciliation, \r\nsocial cohesion and political tolerance in the country.\r\nWith regard to the inter-Burundian dialogue, my \r\ndelegation notes that dialogue as a means of finding \r\npeaceful solutions to political disputes has become part \r\nof our culture. Those who ask us to promote dialogue \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 39/53\r\nare pounding on a door that is already open. In addition \r\nto the very commendable efforts of the East African \r\nCommunity, Burundi has the Permanent Forum of \r\nPolitical Parties — an excellent platform for dialogue \r\namong approved political parties in Burundi. It is \r\nwithin that framework that all political parties met in \r\nthe north of Burundi on 3 August to informally discuss \r\nthe important issues of the 2020 elections. The meeting \r\nresulted in the adoption by more than 20 political \r\nparties of a road map for free, inclusive and peaceful \r\nelections in 2020. The Independent National Electoral \r\nCommission, in accordance with the new Constitution, \r\nwas also set up recently with due consideration given \r\nto the need to respect political, ethnic, regional and \r\ngender inclusiveness.\r\nRegional dynamics are continuing normally. We \r\nhave reached out to contacts at the highest level since the \r\nbeginning of the year. Nearby, at the beginning of this \r\nmonth, the former President of Tanzania and facilitator \r\nof the inter-Burundian dialogue, Mr. Benjamin William \r\nMkapa, sent his team to Burundi for constructive \r\nconsultations with all stakeholders in the country \r\nwith a view to organizing the fifth and final round of \r\nthe inter-Burundian dialogue in preparation for free, \r\ntransparent and peaceful elections in 2020.\r\nOn the security front, the situation in Burundi is \r\ncalm, stable and fully under control, with the exception \r\nof a few cases of common-law crime. That positive \r\nobservation was echoed by subregional organizations as \r\nwell as by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General \r\nfor Burundi and the Security Council in the 9 August \r\nbriefing (see S/PV.8325) and the press statement of \r\n22 August (SC/13461), respectively. That return to \r\nnormalcy in the country made it possible, among \r\nother things, to hold the constitutional referendum \r\nwithout major incident, to accommodate a massive \r\nreturn of refugees and political leaders, to host several \r\nconferences at the regional and continental levels, and \r\nto host foreign dignitaries visiting Burundi.\r\nWith regard to the return of refugees, I am pleased to \r\ninform you that since 2016, more than 206,000 refugees \r\nhave returned voluntarily to Burundi — including \r\n100,000 who decided to return in 2016; 168,000 who \r\nreturned to their families from January to August 2017; \r\nand 38,254 who have returned since the August 2017 \r\ntripartite agreement between Burundi, Tanzania and \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees (UNHCR). That voluntary return of \r\nrefugees is continuing at a satisfactory pace. However, \r\nmy delegation would like to reiterate its request to \r\nUNHCR and friends in the region to intervene because \r\nsome host countries are holding our exiled fellow \r\ncountrymen hostage by erecting artificial obstacles \r\nto their voluntary return home. We also ask UNHCR \r\nto ensure that refugee camps maintain their civilian \r\ncharacter, in accordance with the 1951 Convention \r\nrelating to the Status of Refugees and Security Council \r\nresolution 2389 (2017) of 8 December on the Great \r\nLakes region.\r\nIn that same vein, Burundi reiterates its urgent \r\nappeal to all countries that host, support and maintain \r\nthe fugitive rebels of 13 May 2015 to extradite them to \r\nBurundi so that they can be held accountable for their \r\nactions before the courts. Their long-awaited extradition \r\nwould be a major contribution to the strengthening of \r\nthe democratic principles advocated by the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and a clear rejection of any attempt \r\nto gain power by unconstitutional and violent means.\r\nWith regard to human rights, Burundi reiterates its \r\nreadiness to work and cooperate with other nations and \r\nthe United Nations on the promotion of the protection of \r\nhuman rights in Burundi and elsewhere in the world, in \r\naccordance with the rules established by the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. That noble mission will be possible \r\nonly through mutually respectful cooperation, frank \r\nand sincere dialogue among Member States and the use \r\nof mechanisms accepted by all, such as the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review. The dangerous trend of some States \r\nto attempt to transform the Human Rights Council \r\ninto a tool for political pressure and the regulation \r\nof geopolitics in the South risks compromising the \r\nobjectives set by Member States when the Council \r\nwas created in 2006. The drift towards the excessive \r\npoliticization of human rights and the policies of \r\nselectivity and double standards run contrary to the \r\nprinciples of the universality and indivisibility of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe withdrawal of some countries from the \r\nHuman Rights Council should not be interpreted as a \r\nnegative act. Rather, it is a momentary disavowal of the \r\ndysfunction and almost exclusive control of that body \r\nby a minority of States. For its part, the Government \r\nof Burundi remains more committed than ever to the \r\npromotion of human rights in accordance with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and resolution 60/251, of \r\n15 March 2006, establishing the Human Rights Council. \r\nDialogue and cooperation based on mutual respect form \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n40/53 18-30190\r\nthe cornerstone of the Government of Burundi’s policy \r\non the promotion of human rights.\r\nWith regard to cooperation with the United \r\nNations, Burundi is proud to participate actively and \r\nsuccessfully in United Nations and African Union \r\n(AU) peace missions. More than 6,000 Burundian men \r\nand women are deployed in the various peacekeeping \r\noperations, mainly in the Central African Republic \r\nand Somalia. The excellent work of our brave soldiers \r\non peace missions, who have voluntarily chosen to \r\nsacrifice their very lives in saving the lives of others \r\nfar from their homeland and in particularly difficult \r\nconditions, must be duly appreciated and commended. \r\nIn order to demonstrate its growing interest in \r\npeacekeeping, Burundi is proud to have joined other \r\nnations in renewing its international commitment \r\nduring the Action for Peacekeeping high-level meeting \r\nheld on 25 September.\r\nWith regard to Burundi’s presence on the Security \r\nCouncil’s agenda, my delegation would like to reiterate \r\nits strong appeal to the Council to have the courage to \r\nremove Burundi from its agenda. It should be noted \r\nthat the current political and security situation in the \r\ncountry is calm, stable and fully under control. It is far \r\nfrom posing a threat to international peace and security, \r\nwhich is the Security Council’s field of expertise. The \r\nprecious time that the Council allocates to discussing \r\nBurundi should be devoted to the other areas of tension \r\nand conflicts that are raging now. Burundi today should \r\nnot be an item on the agenda of the Security Council. \r\nWe need instead the attention of the United Nations \r\nagencies tasked with socioeconomic development in \r\norder to boost our economic recovery.\r\nThe implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) remains a priority for \r\nBurundi. The Government of Burundi has just adopted \r\na 10-year plan, the Burundi national development plan \r\n2018-2027. The plan aims to restore the structural \r\nbalance of the Burundian economy through the \r\nstrengthening of food self-sufficiency and export \r\ndiversification through the promotion of agro-\r\nindustrial, commercial and extractive enterprises. We \r\nneed to develop the energy and craft sectors, build and \r\nmaintain infrastructure to support growth, improve \r\naccess to basic social services, including education, \r\nhealth and social protection, continue environmental \r\nand regional planning programmes, improve financial \r\ngovernance and decentralization, and develop regional \r\nand international partnerships. The Government of \r\nBurundi therefore calls on all bilateral and multilateral \r\npartners to consider those goals in their projects aimed \r\nat supporting the Burundian people and helping us to \r\nimplement our plan.\r\nWith regard to the unilateral economic sanctions \r\nthat the European Union’s partners have imposed on \r\nBurundi in the aftermath of the 2015 election fever, \r\nmy delegation would like to inform the international \r\ncommunity that the context in which those sanctions \r\nwere imposed has fundamentally changed. My \r\ndelegation also notes that, following the undisputed \r\nreturn of peace and security to the country, the AU \r\nSummit of Heads of State and Government, held in \r\nearly July in Mauritania, adopted a resolution calling \r\non the European Union to lift the unjust and immoral \r\nsanctions against Burundi. At the end of its meeting \r\nin New York on 25 September, the Peace and Security \r\nCouncil of the African Union issued a communiqué \r\nreiterating the call of the previous AU Summit to \r\nlift politically motivated sanctions in order to create \r\nconditions that would foster socioeconomic recovery \r\nin the country. On the same occasion, the Peace and \r\nSecurity Council of the African Union welcomed the \r\nreturn of peace and stability to Burundi.\r\nWith regard to global challenges, Burundi believes \r\nthat migration issues must be resolved in a constructive \r\nand concerted manner among all Member States. \r\nBurundi fully supports the ongoing process within the \r\nOrganization we share to adopt, in December 2018 in \r\nMarrakech, Morocco, a global pact for safe, regular and \r\norderly migration.\r\nWe cannot ignore that climate change is an \r\nexistential threat to the economic, social and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of Africa and beyond. Without immediate \r\nand coordinated action, it will be much more difficult \r\nand costly to adapt to the future consequences of those \r\nchanges. Each State member of the Organization must \r\nurgently respect its freely made commitments within \r\nthe framework of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange. In the same vein, developed countries must \r\nhonour their commitments to finance the adaptation of \r\nSouthern economies to the effects of global warming.\r\nThe SDGs are a call to action for all poor, rich \r\nand middle-income countries to promote prosperity \r\nwhile protecting the planet. In order to achieve the 17 \r\nGoals that we set ourselves in 2015, two factors are \r\nneeded — the political will of all leaders of Member \r\nStates and the availability of adequate and predictable \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 41/53\r\nfunding. Particular attention should be paid to \r\nsupporting the efforts of the most vulnerable countries, \r\nsuch as the least developed countries, landlocked \r\ncountries, small island developing States and countries \r\nin post-conflict situations.\r\nThe quest for peace and stability concerns us all. \r\nIn that regard, we welcome the recent progress made in \r\nthe search for sustainable African solutions to African \r\nproblems. We welcome the new positive developments \r\nfor peace in South Sudan and the positive changes in \r\nthe Horn of Africa. We welcome the fact that those \r\nnew peace initiatives coincide with the Nelson Mandela \r\nDecade of Peace that we adopted in the political \r\ndeclaration of 24 September (resolution 73/1) in this \r\nvery Hall.\r\nThe lack of a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict and the current status quo are contributing \r\nto insecurity and destabilization in the Middle East. \r\nThe international community must mobilize to find \r\na comprehensive resolution to that conflict, which is \r\nmore than 50 years old. Burundi supports the vision of \r\na region where two States, Israel and Palestine, would \r\nlive side by side, within secure and recognized borders, \r\nin peace and mutual respect, in accordance with the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. It is the only \r\nviable solution.\r\nWith regard to the fight against terrorism in all \r\nits forms and manifestations, Burundi will remain \r\ncommitted, alongside other nations, to playing \r\na leading role in the common struggle to build a \r\nworld free of acts of terrorism. However, we remain \r\nconvinced that, beyond the necessary military action, \r\nan effective fight against terrorism requires combating \r\nradicalization, which is fuelled by ignorance, poverty, \r\nyouth unemployment, illiteracy, injustice, humiliation \r\nand exclusion, which provide terrorism with the ideal \r\nprey and all it needs in order to materialize and spread \r\nbefore our eyes.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to note \r\nfrom this rostrum that the realities and demands of the \r\ncurrent world require us to adapt our global governance \r\nto the new challenges of our ever-changing world. \r\nThat leads us to point out that the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the long-awaited reform of the \r\nSecurity Council are becoming increasingly pressing \r\nissues if we want a United Nations that can effectively \r\nmeet the legitimate expectations of all nations. In \r\nthat regard, Burundi reaffirms its commitment to \r\nthe Common African Position on Security Council \r\nreform, as contained in the Ezulwini Consensus. \r\nIt is time to redress the historical injustice done to \r\nAfrica, the only continent that is not represented in the \r\npermanent membership category and one that is also \r\nunderrepresented in the non-permanent membership \r\ncategory of the Security Council.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Dato Seri Paduka Awang Haji \r\nErywan bin Pehin Datu Pekerma Jaya Haji Mohd \r\nYusof, Second Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade \r\nof Brunei Darussalam.\r\nMr. Yusof (Brunei Darussalam): It is a great \r\nhonour and privilege to be here today to convey the \r\nwarm greetings of His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di \r\nPertuan of Brunei Darussalam to all gathered here in \r\nthis Hall.\r\nI express my congratulations to Ms. Maria Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés and the people of Ecuador on her \r\nassuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-third session. I also convey my appreciation to \r\nSecretary-General António Guterres for his hard work \r\nin the service of the international community. I also do \r\nnot want to forget his staff, which continues its work \r\nthroughout the year, not just on a Saturday afternoon.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to join \r\nothers in expressing our condolences to the family of \r\nthe late former Secretary-General Kofi Atta Annan, \r\nwhose remarkable service to the Organization and \r\nmany valuable contributions to advancing global peace, \r\nhumanity and development serve as an inspiration to \r\nus all.\r\nWe are currently living in a world with ever-\r\nincreasing geopolitical and geoeconomic uncertainties. \r\nThe foundations and principles of the international order \r\nthat usually guide our expectations are in some cases \r\nbeing called into question and in others being ignored. \r\nFor a small country such as  Brunei Darussalam, such \r\nunpredictability can be daunting and runs counter to \r\nregional and international efforts to build peaceful, \r\nequitable and sustainable societies.\r\nIn order for us to achieve our goals of maintaining \r\npeace and promoting prosperity and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, we greatly depend on the consistency and \r\nstability underpinned by our adherence to international \r\nobligations and the rule of law. It is crucial that we all \r\ncommit to an effective multilateralism that addresses \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n42/53 18-30190\r\nglobal challenges, ranging from conflict prevention to \r\neconomic uncertainty and environmental degradation. \r\nIn doing so, we have to work together in order to \r\nensure the relevance of the United Nations to all, and \r\neverybody needs to play their part in honouring the \r\ninternational frameworks and agreements that we have \r\nworked so hard to develop together.\r\nOne such agreement is the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, which helps us realize our \r\nvision of improving people’s lives without leaving \r\nanyone behind. We are fully committed to attaining \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the \r\nAgenda, which we hope will safeguard the welfare of \r\nour citizens for generations to come. In our efforts to \r\nachieve the SDGs, it is imperative to understand and \r\nrespect the right of each country to choose its own \r\ndevelopment path, including the adoption of legislation \r\nthat is suited to its own national circumstances.\r\nA challenge for many developing countries in \r\npursuing sustained economic development is posed by \r\nthe uneven growth prospects amid many risks, including \r\nvolatility in energy prices. Brunei Darussalam is no \r\nexception. To meet that challenge, we are concentrating \r\non diversifying our economy. Underlying those efforts \r\nis our commitment to free trade and the rules-based \r\nmultilateral trading system. It is critical, especially \r\nduring these times of increasing trade tensions, that all \r\ncan benefit from it.\r\nOur stand on that matter is evident through our \r\nparticipation in various platforms such as the World \r\nTrade Organization and the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations, which support efforts to facilitate trade \r\nand investment. Our involvement in various bilateral \r\nand multilateral free-trade agreements is also a \r\ntestament to that commitment. Such agreements help \r\nensure market access and strengthen trade links with \r\nour partners within and outside the region. They are \r\nparticularly beneficial to small developing countries \r\nbecause they also spur other forms of cooperation, \r\nincluding human resources development and technical \r\nassistance. All of these are vital as we prepare ourselves \r\nto take advantage of the potential opportunities brought \r\nabout by the fourth industrial revolution.\r\nThat being said, we also need to remain mindful of \r\nthe fact that efforts to increase economic growth should \r\nbe aligned with our shared responsibilities to ensure a \r\nsafe and healthy environment for our future. Climate \r\nchange poses a clear and serious threat to humankind, \r\nand the Paris Agreement on Climate Change remains \r\nour greatest hope in addressing that global challenge \r\ntogether. Our progress in meeting the economic \r\nand environmental goals under the 2030 Agenda is \r\ndetermined by our ability to maintain durable peace and \r\nstability. The work of the United Nations in preventive \r\ndiplomacy, mediation and peacekeeping is key to the \r\nprevention and resolution of conflict and violence.\r\nIn that regard, we appreciate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts to strengthen peacekeeping operations \r\nthrough his Action for Peacekeeping initiative, which \r\nwill enhance global support for peacekeeping missions \r\nwith a view to contributing towards sustainable peace. \r\nWe truly value the self less work and sacrifice that \r\nour peacekeepers show in securing a better world. \r\nTherefore, we are also pleased to join others in endorsing \r\nthe Declaration of Shared Commitments on United \r\nNations Peacekeeping Operations, as it underscores our \r\ncollective investment in the success and performance of \r\nour peacekeepers.\r\nLastly, in building a more peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable world, it is important that the United \r\nNations continue to promote the rule of law. On that \r\nnote, we are particularly concerned over the unresolved \r\nquestion of Palestine. For more than half a century, \r\nPalestinians have been denied peace, justice and \r\nfreedom. In solidarity with the Palestinian people, we \r\nstrongly condemn actions and measures that blatantly \r\nviolate their rights and dignity. Those violations run \r\ncounter to international law, including the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nLike many countries, we have been alarmed by the \r\ndevelopments in Jerusalem and the continued violence \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory. We remain firm in \r\nsupporting the call to protect the Palestinian population \r\nand to assist in the creation of a fully independent \r\nPalestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital. \r\nIt is Brunei Darussalam’s greatest hope for Palestine \r\nthat all States Members of the United Nations and \r\nother organizations will work together to realize the \r\nvision of a two-State solution, in full conformity with \r\ninternational law, the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nall relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nOur unwavering commitment to international \r\nnorms and multilateral partnerships is central to our \r\nefforts to advance our mutual aspirations of living \r\ntogether in peace and harmony. A significant part of \r\nthat commitment is our continued support for the United \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 43/53\r\nNations. For more than 70 years, the United Nations \r\nhas been the epicentre of our rules-based multilateral \r\nsystem, where its work, from advocating values of \r\nmutual respect to promoting development, has made an \r\nimpact on people all over the globe. In spite of that, it \r\nstill faces its fair share of criticism. The United Nations \r\nmight not be perfect, but it is the best hope that we have \r\nfor achieving the future that we want together.\r\nMrs. Gueguen (France), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe late Kofi Annan once said that we need to keep \r\nhope alive and strive to do better. For our part, Brunei \r\nDarussalam will continue to be a reliable partner and \r\na friend to all for the betterment of the United Nations \r\nand the world at large.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Makhdoom Shah Mahmood \r\nHussain Qureshi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan.\r\nMr. Qureshi (Pakistan) (spoke in Urdu; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): May I begin by \r\ncongratulating Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés \r\non her election as President of the General Assembly. \r\nThe stewardship of this session by an accomplished \r\nleader of her rank and stature will undoubtedly lend to \r\nthe proceedings of the Assembly greater credence and \r\nstrength. I also commend Mr. Miroslav Lajčák for his \r\nable guidance during the previous session.\r\nWe appreciate Secretary-General António Guterres \r\nfor his exemplary leadership of the Organization, and \r\nsupport his efforts to instil a new sense of mission \r\nand direction within the United Nations. We offer \r\nour profound condolences over the passing of the late \r\nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was a \r\nleading light and a driving force in taking the United \r\nNations agenda forward into the twenty-first century.\r\nWe also express our deep sympathy and \r\ncondolences to the Government and people of \r\nIndonesia over the damage caused by the earthquake \r\nand subsequent tsunami.\r\nTwo months ago, the people of Pakistan voted \r\nfor change, reform and a fundamental shift in their \r\nparadigm of governance. They opted for a Pakistan that \r\nis confident and compassionate, open and articulate, \r\nas well as peaceful and principled — a Pakistan that \r\nwill engage with its neighbourhood and the world on \r\nthe basis of equality and respect; a country that will \r\nseek the resolution of conflicts and the convergence \r\nof interests; and a State that will build upon common \r\nunderstandings, reciprocal commitments and \r\nshared ideals.\r\nPakistan will brook no compromise on the interests \r\nof the nation, the sovereignty of the State or the security \r\nof its people. Our Government is keen to pursue a policy \r\nof partnerships for peace, security and prosperity in \r\nour immediate neighbourhood and beyond. We seek \r\na peaceful environment to promote our development \r\nagenda, at both the national and the regional levels.\r\nI stand before the Assembly as the representative of \r\na quintessential developing country that has the welfare \r\nof its people at its heart. Under the leadership of Prime \r\nMinister Imran Khan, we have begun giving shape to \r\nthe vision of a new Pakistan through a set of integrated \r\npolicies and programmes.\r\nThe world is facing a moment of inflection. \r\nThe very foundations and principles on which the \r\nedifice of global order has been constructed are \r\nunder assault. Inequality within and among nations \r\nis on the rise. The forces of protectionism, populism \r\nand isolationism are gaining currency. Intolerance is \r\nascendant over acceptance, rhetoric over reason, and \r\npower over principle. Where the world needs bridges, \r\nwe see fortifications; where it needs highways, we see \r\nblockades; and where it yearns for freedom, we see \r\ncages. New forms and manifestations of imperialism \r\nare appearing. Multilateralism is on a path of retreat. \r\nUnilateralist tendencies are growing. Long-standing \r\nlegal norms are being eroded for strategic and \r\ncommercial considerations.\r\nDark clouds of trade wars are looming large \r\non the horizon. The challenges of climate change, \r\nenvironmental degradation, pandemics, transnational \r\norganized crime and sustainable development are \r\nbecoming ever more complex. The post-World War \r\nidealism is giving way, slowly but surely, to a hardened, \r\nmilitaristic approach. That trend is not only regressive, \r\nit is downright dangerous.\r\nWe note with concern seismic shifts in the \r\ngeopolitical landscape of the Middle East. As existing \r\nconflicts are exacerbated, new threats have emerged. \r\nCompeting interests of regional and extraregional \r\nPowers are deepening long-standing fissures and \r\nwidening the fault lines, even as the tragedy of Palestine \r\ncontinues to fester. In these uncertain times, the global \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n44/53 18-30190\r\ncommunity appears to be on a desperate quest for \r\nleadership, a vision and an order.\r\nLet us consider the issue of striking the right \r\nbalance between the freedom of expression and the \r\nsentiments of a people. Where there ought to be empathy, \r\nunderstanding and compassion, we see caricatured, ill-\r\ninformed and jaundiced judgments. Recently, Muslims \r\nacross the world were pained at a planned competition \r\nof cartoons of our holy Prophet — peace be upon him. \r\nThat deeply hurt Muslim sentiments and sensibilities. \r\nFor its part, Pakistan will continue to collaborate \r\nwith friends and partners on the United Nations and \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation platforms aimed \r\nat reversing the growing tide of bigotry, at building \r\ncross-cultural understandings and promoting dialogue \r\namong civilizations.\r\nThe theme of this year’s General Assembly \r\nsession is not only apt but also mirrors the priorities \r\nof my Government. As we embark on our journey of \r\nchange and reform, Pakistan stands ready to strengthen \r\nits partnership with the United Nations family of \r\ninstitutions. Alongside like-minded States, we will \r\ncontinue to be a leading voice advocating for the \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council, with \r\na view to making it more democratic, representative, \r\ntransparent and effective. We will continue to oppose \r\nthe creation of new centres of privilege and prestige \r\nin defiance of the principles of democracy and the \r\ncore tenet of the Charter of the United Nations on the \r\nsovereign equality of Member States.\r\nSince its inception, Pakistan has been an ardent \r\nadherent to the Charter of the United Nations, and an \r\nactive participant in United Nations processes. Pakistan \r\nhas served seven terms on the Security Council, five \r\npresidencies of the Economic and Social Council and \r\nfour terms on the Human Rights Council. That is a \r\nreaffirmation of the international community’s faith \r\nin Pakistan.\r\nWe have championed the cause of the peoples of \r\nAfrica and Asia as they seek to exercise their inalienable \r\nright of self-determination and wrest independence \r\nfrom the yoke of colonial rule. As we pay tribute to the \r\nmemory of the late Nelson Mandela, Madiba, we are \r\nreminded of the high ideals for which he sacrificed so \r\nmuch. The best way to honour the legacy of that great \r\nleader is to continue to fight the good fight for freedom, \r\ndignity and equality.\r\nPakistan remains one of the oldest, largest and most \r\nactive contributors to United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations the world over. Pakistani Blue Helmets have \r\nlaid down their lives in the cause of global peace. We \r\nare proud of their sacrifices. Pakistan also remains host \r\nto one of the oldest peacekeeping missions, the United \r\nNations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan. \r\nWe greatly value the Observer Group’s contribution to \r\nmonitoring the ceasefire along the Line of Control in \r\nJammu and Kashmir.\r\nPakistan desires a relationship with India based \r\non sovereign equality and mutual respect. We seek \r\nresolution of disputes through serious and comprehensive \r\ndialogue that covers all issues of concern. We were to \r\nmeet on the sidelines of this session of the General \r\nAssembly to talk about all issues with India. The Modi \r\nGovernment of India called off the dialogue for the \r\nthird time, each time on f limsy grounds. They chose \r\npolitics over peace. They used the pretext of Pakistani \r\nstamps issued months ago depicting a Kashmiri activist \r\nand grave human rights violations, including pellet gun \r\nvictims, as an excuse to back out from the talks.\r\nDialogue is the only way to address the long-\r\nstanding issues that have long bedevilled South Asia and \r\nprevented the region from realizing its true potential. \r\nThe unresolved Jammu and Kashmir dispute hinders \r\nthe realization of the goal of durable peace between our \r\ntwo countries. For over 70 years now, it has remained on \r\nthe agenda of the Security Council and is a blot on the \r\nconscience of humankind. For 70 years, the people of \r\noccupied Jammu and Kashmir have struggled for their \r\nright to self-determination in the face of overwhelming \r\noppression and gross violations of their fundamental \r\nhuman rights by the Indian occupation forces.\r\nPakistan welcomes the recently released report by \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights. The report rightly lifts the veil from \r\ndecades of obfuscation and chronicles the massive \r\nongoing violations of human rights in Indian-occupied \r\nKashmir. It vindicates our position. No longer can the \r\nexcuse of terrorism be used to continue to systematically \r\noppress the Kashmiri people. Pakistan endorses the \r\nUnited Nations report and calls for the early institution \r\nof a commission of inquiry under United Nations \r\nauspices to investigate and ascribe responsibility. We \r\nwill welcome the commission to Azad Jammu and \r\nKashmir, and we hope that India will do the same, too.\r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 45/53\r\nTo divert the world’s attention from its brutalities, \r\nIndia frequently violates the ceasefire along the Line \r\nof Control in Kashmir. Despite numerous violations, \r\nPakistan has acted with restraint. But if India ventures \r\nacross the Line of Control, or acts upon its doctrine of \r\nlimited war against Pakistan, it will evoke a strong and \r\nmatching response.\r\nStrategic stability in our region has been and \r\ncontinues to be undermined. That is evident in various \r\nways, including by the introduction of destabilizing \r\nweapon systems, the pursuit of discriminatory \r\napproaches by certain States to supply advanced \r\nmilitary hardware and sensitive technologies, and the \r\nadoption of offensive force postures and doctrines \r\nthat envisage a conflict beneath the nuclear threshold. \r\nIn the circumstances, Pakistan has no option but to \r\nmaintain a minimum credible deterrence. We have been \r\nadvocating for many years now for a strategic restraint \r\nregime for South Asia. Pakistan is ready to engage with \r\nIndia to promote meaningful confidence-building, risk \r\nreduction and measures to avoid an arms race.\r\nLet me also reiterate Pakistan’s continued support \r\nfor strengthening regional organizations as platforms \r\nfor poverty alleviation and socioeconomic uplift. \r\nThe regional body for South Asia, the South Asian \r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), has \r\nbeen rendered ineffective owing to the intransigence \r\nof one country. We remain fully committed to a \r\nfunctioning SAARC that can improve the lives of the \r\npeople of the region.\r\nAfghanistan, and together with it, Pakistan, has \r\nsuffered heavily owing to global power plays, strategic \r\nmiscalculations and cognitive dissonance. That there \r\nis no military solution to the war in Afghanistan is \r\nnow a foregone conclusion. It is time to act upon that \r\nconclusion. A negotiated settlement has assumed \r\nurgency in the face of the worrisome and growing \r\npresence of Da’esh in Afghanistan. Pakistan will \r\ncontinue to lend its support to an Afghan-owned and \r\nAfghan-led peace and reconciliation process.\r\nOn the bilateral plane, our two countries have \r\noperationalized the Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan \r\nfor Peace and Solidarity. It lays down the blueprint for \r\nextensive engagement in all areas of common interests. \r\nPakistan has hosted the longest-lasting refugee presence \r\nof modern times. Our role and sacrifices can perhaps \r\nbe better appreciated when juxtaposed with the rising \r\ntide of anti-immigrant sentiments in nations that are \r\nmore resource-rich and developed than ours and that \r\nhave faced the brunt of fewer immigrants and over a \r\nshorter timescale. Because of the protracted conflict \r\nsituation in that country, Afghanistan’s security has a \r\ndirect spillover impact on our security and stability. We \r\nlook forward to the safe, dignified and voluntary return \r\nof Afghan refugees to their homeland.\r\nFor the past 17 years, Pakistan, at a great cost of \r\nlife and resources, has been combating the fires of \r\nterrorism and extremism. Through the determined \r\noperations of our armed forces and with the full support \r\nof our people, Pakistan has turned the tide against \r\nterrorism. With the deployment of 200,000 troops, \r\nPakistan has conducted the largest and most effective \r\ncounter-terrorism campaign in the world. Peace and \r\nsecurity have returned to our cities and towns. In our \r\nown national interest and in line with our national \r\naction plan, we will continue to strengthen our counter-\r\nterrorism frameworks and regimes.\r\nPakistan continues to face terrorism that is \r\nfinanced, facilitated and orchestrated by our eastern \r\nneighbour. We wanted to sit with India to discuss all \r\nissues, including terrorism, that have created violence \r\nin our cities and towns and have led to tens of thousands \r\nof casualties among innocent Pakistanis. Pakistan shall \r\nnever forget the mass murder of more than 150 children \r\nin a Peshawar school, the terrible Mastung attack and \r\nmany others that have links with terrorists supported \r\nby India, and we will never forget the terrorist attack \r\nin India against the Samjhauta Express, which was \r\ncarrying innocent Pakistanis — and now its confessed \r\nperpetrators are being allowed to walk free.\r\nWe wanted to share the evidence with India and \r\nthe international community concerning those who \r\nsupported those acts of violence and terrorism. We have \r\nalready shared that evidence with the United Nations. \r\nWe have in our custody a serving Indian naval officer, \r\nCommander Kulbhushan Jadhav, who has provided \r\nus with the most incriminating evidence by accepting \r\nthat he, at the instruction of his Government, financed, \r\nplanned and executed acts of terrorism and violence \r\nin Pakistan. That is but one Indian State-sponsored \r\nofficial terrorist. Many more have been launched by \r\nour eastern neighbour inside Pakistan to create terror \r\nand mayhem.\r\nIt is India that, in plain sight of the international \r\ncommunity, perpetrates State-sponsored terrorism in \r\nIndian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and in other parts \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n46/53 18-30190\r\nof India. It is of concern to the United Nations, given \r\nthe fact that Jammu and Kashmir remains on the agenda \r\nof the Security Council, and it is a matter of concern \r\nfor the international community, as humankind is being \r\ncrushed and human rights are being violated all over \r\nIndia, where people have stood up against oppression \r\nand occupation and demanded their fundamental \r\nrights. It is also a matter of concern for the international \r\ncommunity that India has sponsored terrorism and \r\naggression against all of its neighbours.\r\nThe strongest antidote to the poison of terrorism \r\nis development that yields dividends. The vision of the \r\nBelt and Road Initiative is path-breaking and is being \r\nled by a world leader of great wisdom and foresight to \r\ncreate a community of common destiny. It is a global \r\ncommon good that is beneficial to all. Our vision for the \r\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor is to help translate \r\nour geostrategic potential into geoeconomic dividends. \r\nPakistan looks to offer the vital connectivity nodes \r\nlinking the Middle East with western China, which will \r\nafford Central Asia the shortest, most feasible access \r\npossible to the sea.\r\nThe challenges of our times have enhanced, not \r\ndiminished, the relevance of the United Nations. The \r\nUnited Nations must remain the central platform \r\nfor dialogue and diplomacy. In order for the United \r\nNations to remain relevant to the needs of the people \r\nand respond to the demands of the twenty-first century, \r\nwe believe that the following steps must by taken.\r\nFirst, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nmust be pursued in order to reduce inequality within \r\nand among nations. We hope that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s High-level Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and the Means of Implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, held earlier \r\nthis week, will serve as a catalyst for rapid progress \r\ntowards achieving the SDGs.\r\nSecond, corruption is a grave crime. Those who \r\nprovide safe havens for ill-gotten wealth are partners in \r\nthe crime and equally culpable. Existing international \r\nconventions on corruption do not go far enough in \r\naddressing that malaise. It is time to return the looted \r\nwealth to its rightful owners, namely, the people, and to \r\nhold both the perpetrators and their abettors accountable.\r\nThird, climate change poses serious challenges to \r\nall States. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change \r\nmust not be allowed to be held hostage to sectoral \r\ninterests. Even as Pakistan contributes minimally to \r\nglobal emissions, our country remains among the most \r\nvulnerable. Our Government completed the planting of \r\none billion trees — a project in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \r\nprovince. We have now launched an ambitious project \r\nto plant 10 billion trees across all of Pakistan.\r\nFourth, a rules-based global order is vital for the \r\npromotion of international trade in goods and services, \r\nas well as global nuclear commerce and governance \r\nmechanisms. Carving out exemptions and bending \r\nestablished rules to suit partisan interests must \r\nbe eschewed.\r\nFifth, objective and transparent criteria must be \r\ndeveloped to facilitate trade in strategic goods and \r\nmembership in the groupings that govern it. That is \r\nessential for countries pursuing economic growth \r\nand development.\r\nSixth, the sanctity and integrity of international \r\nagreements must be maintained. Strategic stability must \r\nbe nurtured by policies of restraint and responsibility, \r\nnot by considerations of profits and politics.\r\nSeventh, technology and innovation are key to \r\nreshaping our States and societies. We must strike a \r\nprudent balance between guarding against the misuse \r\nof emerging technologies and facilitating access to \r\nthem on the part of developing countries. It is essential \r\nto develop universally agreed legal frameworks in \r\nthe area of cybersecurity, lethal autonomous weapons \r\nsystems, artificial intelligence and the weaponization \r\nof outer space.\r\nEighth, the dislocation of people in recent years, \r\nprimarily because of wars but also as a result of \r\npervasive poverty, has energized the global debate on \r\nrefugees and migrants. The deliberations leading to the \r\nglobal compacts on refugees and migrants represent \r\na step in the right direction. The true litmus test of \r\nthose compacts lies in the effective implementation \r\nof commitments.\r\nPakistan believes that a new consensus on peace, \r\nsecurity and development can and should be developed. \r\nA new paradigm for universal peace and prosperity \r\nis both desirable and achievable. Pakistan will be a \r\nwilling and able partner to the international community \r\nin that worthwhile pursuit. The challenges ahead are \r\ndaunting; the road forward is untravelled, and the \r\nroute is uncharted. These times call for deliberation \r\nand diligence, but also for cooperation and concerted \r\naction. They call for a truly united United Nations.\r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 47/53\r\nThe Kashmiri wife who lost her husband, the \r\nKashmiri school boy who lost his eyesight and his \r\nfuture to pellet-gun injuries, the Syrian father who saw \r\nhis child drown, the Palestinian girl who suffocates \r\nunder siege, and the African migrant willing to risk all \r\nfor a better life continue to look to the United Nations \r\nfor support and succour. Let us not fail them any longer.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Denis Moses, Minister for \r\nForeign and CARICOM Affairs of the Republic of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago.\r\nMr. Moses (Trinidad and Tobago): I am honoured \r\nto address this eminent gathering of nations seized \r\nwith advancing the international agenda towards \r\nthe realization of international peace, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the well-being of all humankind.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of \r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, I extend our \r\ncongratulations to the President on her election to lead \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-third session. As \r\nwe continue to pursue gender equality across all borders \r\nand spheres of endeavour, her election to the post of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly is further impetus \r\nfor the global rethinking and acceptance of female \r\nleadership, and towards strengthening the global \r\npursuit of gender parity, empowerment and equality.\r\nAllow me to further express the gratitude of the \r\ndelegation of Trinidad and Tobago to her predecessor, \r\nHis Excellency Miroslav Lajčák, whose leadership \r\nhelped advance the efforts of the United Nations to \r\nundertake the ambitious task of system-wide reform. \r\nThe reform agenda marks a new, emerging approach to \r\nmultilateral institutionalism and presents an opportunity \r\nto transform the United Nations into a dynamic body \r\ncapable of better responding to the needs and challenges \r\nthat reflect the diversity of its membership.\r\nThis year’s theme, “Making the United Nations \r\nrelevant to all people: global leadership and shared \r\nresponsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties”, compels us to reflect on the nexus between \r\nthe Organization’s ambitious and comprehensive \r\nreform agenda and our shared pursuit of a sustainable \r\nfuture for all. The myriad multidimensional threats that \r\nlitter the international development landscape threaten \r\nour efforts to ensure universal sustainable development \r\nand the eradication of extreme poverty, as well as peace \r\nand security and the enjoyment of fundamental human \r\nrights by all.\r\nThe existential threat posed by unmitigated climate \r\nchange and global warming, extreme poverty, violent \r\nextremism, gender-based violence and the spread of new \r\nand infectious diseases is one that is best faced together \r\nas Members of the United Nations. As the bastion \r\nof international peace and security, human rights, \r\nsustainable development and the rule of law, the United \r\nNations, as an institution, is compelled to adopt a shift \r\nin its approach in order to ensure adequate, effective \r\nand efficient responses to the challenges of our time. \r\nIt is on that basis that the Government of Trinidad and \r\nTobago reaffirms its support for the implementation of \r\nthe Secretary-General’s reform agenda, in accordance \r\nwith the relevant General Assembly resolutions.\r\nAs we pursue the cost savings and efficiencies \r\nassociated with the reform agenda, however, it is \r\nimperative that we not lose sight of the foundational \r\nprinciples, values and overarching objectives of this \r\ninstitution. In that regard, I am reminded of the words \r\nof our former Secretary-General, the late Kofi Annan. \r\nHe reminded us that, even though the United Nations \r\nis an Organization of States, the Charter of the United \r\nNations is written in the name of “We the peoples.” \r\nUltimately, that is the role of the United Nations, namely, \r\nto serve the needs and hopes of people everywhere. \r\nPeople must be at the centre of our common endeavour.\r\nHaving recognized that far-reaching truth, the \r\nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago, through wide \r\nconsultation, developed its Vision 2030 national \r\ndevelopment strategy. That multidimensional and \r\ninclusive development policy places our people, our \r\ngreatest resource, at the centre of our pursuit of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. If we really are to \r\nensure that no one is left behind, we must redouble our \r\nefforts to ensure equitable access to opportunity and \r\nmobility for the most vulnerable. Those who have long \r\nbeen left behind must now be positioned to participate \r\nin society as equals.\r\nBy its very nature, the scope of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development speaks to the wide range \r\nof issues that challenge global sustainable development. \r\nNotwithstanding the global relevance of those \r\nchallenges, it is widely acknowledged that asymmetries \r\nexist with regard to the impact of external shocks on \r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS), such as Trinidad \r\nand Tobago and the Caribbean region.\r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago \r\nrecognizes the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n48/53 18-30190\r\nAction (SAMOA) Pathway as an essential component \r\nin the catalogue of development frameworks needed \r\nto specifically guide the sustainable development of \r\nSIDS. Accordingly, Trinidad and Tobago welcomes \r\nthe San Pedro Declaration adopted at the Caribbean \r\nRegional Preparatory Meeting for the Midterm Review \r\nof the SAMOA Pathway in Belize, and looks forward \r\nto participating in the high-level review summit of \r\nthe SAMOA Pathway in 2019. Moreover, Trinidad and \r\nTobago takes this opportunity to reinforce the principle \r\nthat SIDS continue to be a special case for sustainable \r\ndevelopment, given our complex and intricate \r\nchallenges. As we and our regional partners prioritize \r\nthe unique threats to the development of our people, the \r\n2030 Agenda provides an important guide in our efforts \r\nto ensure that none of our citizens are left behind.\r\nIn manifesting the intent of Agenda 2030, we \r\nhave come to appreciate the importance of prioritizing \r\nthe well-being of all of our citizens. In that regard, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago and our Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) counterparts are taking action to address \r\nthe threat that the high incidence of non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs) poses to our region. Those diseases \r\nravage our human resources, burden our health-care \r\nsystems and undermine our development efforts. Since \r\nthe adoption of the Port of Spain Declaration on NCDs \r\nby the CARICOM Heads of Government in 2007 and \r\nthe landmark United Nations high-level meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the prevention and control of \r\nnon-communicable diseases in 2011 (see A/66/PV.3 et \r\nseq.), Trinidad and Tobago has implemented a number \r\nof strategies for controlling and reducing NCDs.\r\nOur 2017-2021 National Strategic Plan for the \r\nPrevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases \r\naims to harness the collective efforts of both the public \r\nand private sectors to prevent and control NCDs. In \r\nthat regard, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago \r\nwelcomes the adoption of the political declaration of \r\nthe third high-level meeting of the General Assembly \r\non the prevention and control of non-communicable \r\ndiseases. By raising the standard of living, improving \r\nthe educational and health-care systems and providing \r\nequal access to opportunities, Trinidad and Tobago’s \r\nVision 2030 is actively pursuing the development \r\nof a resilient, equitable and healthy society that \r\nplaces all people at the centre of our sustainable \r\ndevelopment efforts.\r\nHowever, no challenge is more pressing than \r\nclimate change. For small island developing States such \r\nas Trinidad and Tobago, casting doubt on the scientific \r\ntruth behind climate change only serves to distract and \r\ndelay the urgent and ambitious action that is needed to \r\nconfront the existential threat posed by global warming.\r\nEarlier this year, the Government of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago deposited its instrument of ratification \r\nto the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, thereby \r\nformalizing its steadfast commitment to the principles \r\nand goals of the Agreement. As our national contribution \r\nto achieving the overarching objectives of the Paris \r\nAgreement, Trinidad and Tobago has committed to \r\nreducing cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions from \r\nindustry, power generation and the transport sector by \r\n15 per cent by the year 2030.\r\nAs a State party to the agreement, Trinidad and \r\nTobago will be actively engaged in the negotiating \r\nprocess within the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, which seeks to operationalize the Paris \r\nAgreement on a scale that will result in achieving \r\nthe long-term temperature goal and further limit the \r\nincrease in global temperature to 1.5°C. It is also \r\nhoped that the operationalization process will catalyse \r\ninternational cooperation on mitigation, adaptation and \r\nclimate finance to that end.\r\nOur commitment to the Paris Agreement \r\nreflects Trinidad and Tobago’s assumption of overall \r\nresponsibility to support international efforts to tackle \r\nshared environmental challenges, which include \r\nclimate change, ozone depletion, land degradation, the \r\nloss of biodiversity, the illegal trade in wildlife and the \r\nmovement of hazardous waste.\r\nAs a twin-island State, the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources \r\nis critically important to the development priorities of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago. However, Trinidad and Tobago \r\nis located in a region that is highly vulnerable to an \r\nunprecedented rate of loss of marine biodiversity \r\nand to the impact of unsustainable practices on the \r\nmarine environment.\r\nWe therefore welcome the first session of the \r\nintergovernmental conference that seeks to develop a \r\nlegally binding instrument under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity \r\nbeyond areas of national jurisdiction. The Government \r\nof Trinidad and Tobago looks forward to participating \r\nin future sessions of the intergovernmental conference \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 49/53\r\nin 2019 and 2020, which will draft the text of the \r\ninstrument that will ensure the protection and sustainable \r\nmanagement of the common heritage of humankind for \r\nthe benefit of present and future generations.\r\nOne of the pressing challenges facing the region \r\nis the termination of correspondent banking relations \r\nand the labelling of countries in the region as \r\nnon-cooperative tax jurisdictions. Those actions have \r\nseverely destabilized the financial sectors of the region \r\nwithout due consideration having been given to the \r\nfinancial, human and technical constraints confronting \r\nour member countries.\r\nAs a result, the region’s efforts to bolster our \r\neconomic stability and effectively engage in the global \r\nfinancial system have been stymied to the detriment \r\nof our economic growth and progress. That has the \r\npotential to further erode the development gains \r\nachieved thus far. In that regard, Trinidad and Tobago \r\njoins with other CARICOM member States in reiterating \r\nour commitment to ensuring compliance with globally \r\naccepted standards and calls on our international \r\npartners to engage constructively on that issue.\r\nIn our collective journey towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago \r\nis fully convinced that the United Nations development \r\nsystem will, for the foreseeable future, remain a reliable \r\npartner in assisting our country in its efforts to achieve \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and our Vision \r\n2030 national development strategy.\r\nWith that in mind, the Government of Trinidad and \r\nTobago welcomes the Secretary-General’s efforts to \r\nreposition the United Nations development system in \r\norder better to support the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda and the SAMOA Pathway, including through \r\na reinvigorated resident coordinator system. Trinidad \r\nand Tobago reiterates the importance of ensuring that \r\nthe development system adopts a more responsive and \r\nf lexible approach to development assistance, based \r\non national priorities and needs, while strengthening \r\nnational ownership and leadership.\r\nThe United Nations has long recognized the \r\ninterconnectedness between peace and development \r\n─ a symbiotic relationship, where one cannot exist \r\nwithout the other. Ongoing conflicts across the world \r\nserve as stark reminders of the need to promote a \r\npositive, dynamic and participatory international peace \r\nand security architecture that is based on the spirit \r\nof mutual understanding and cooperation between \r\nGovernments, international organizations and civil \r\nsociety ─ one that is in compliance with international \r\nobligations under the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law.\r\nThe illegal trade in arms continues to affect the social \r\nand economic fabric of the Caribbean region, including \r\nTrinidad and Tobago. That is particularly true of the \r\ntrade in small arms and light weapons, which is linked \r\nto other transnational organized crimes, such as drug \r\ntrafficking. It threatens the livelihood of our people, \r\nundermines the rule of law and challenges our efforts \r\nto ensure a peaceful, equitable and sustainable country.\r\nAt the global level, Trinidad and Tobago fully \r\nsubscribes to the object and purpose of the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty, which can be leveraged as a mechanism \r\nfor reducing the incidence of armed violence in \r\nthe region. Thus, since 2010, Trinidad and Tobago \r\nhas presented the biennial resolution on women, \r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control, which \r\nencourages women’s participation in disarmament \r\ndecision-making processes.\r\nOn the issue of denuclearization, Trinidad and \r\nTobago resolutely believes that the use or the threat \r\nof use of nuclear weapons constitutes a crime against \r\nhumanity and a violation of international law, including \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago therefore \r\nremains firm in its support for the full and effective \r\nimplementation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of \r\nNuclear Weapons and is actively considering its \r\nsignature and ratification.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago has long recognized that \r\ninternational peace and security must be supported by a \r\nrobust international legal system, including international \r\ncriminal justice. Trinidad and Tobago, through the \r\nwork of our former Prime Minister and President, the \r\nlate Arthur Robinson, was at the vanguard of efforts to \r\nestablish the International Criminal Court (ICC) two \r\ndecades ago. Trinidad and Tobago remains a fervent \r\nadvocate of the Court, underscoring its importance and \r\nlegitimacy in various forums. We stand resolute in our \r\ncommitment to support the mandate of the ICC and to \r\npromote the universality of the Rome Statue.\r\nThe delegation of Trinidad and Tobago wishes \r\nto make the point that, consistent with the principle \r\nof complementarity enshrined in the Rome Statute, \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction is invoked only when States \r\nare unable or unwilling to prosecute those accused of \r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n50/53 18-30190\r\ncommitting the most serious crimes of concern to the \r\ninternational community. At the adoption of the Rome \r\nStatute in June 1998, the late Kofi Annan stated that:\r\n“Gradually the world has come to realize that \r\nrelying on each State or army to punish its own \r\ntransgressors is not enough. When crimes are \r\ncommitted on such a scale, we know that the State \r\nlacks either the power or the will to stop them.”\r\nTherefore, no individual or State that demonstrates \r\nfull respect for international humanitarian law and \r\ninternational human rights need fear the ICC. Those \r\nwho fail to cooperate with the Court are contributing \r\nto a culture of impunity that undermines the rule of law \r\nand denies justice to victims of heinous crimes.\r\nOur best efforts to strengthen multilateral peace \r\nand security will surely fall short unless there is real \r\nand significant reform of the Security Council. While \r\nwe welcome the continuation of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform, Trinidad and \r\nTobago remains concerned that such discussions have \r\nnot resulted in tangible progress towards a text-based \r\nnegotiation. Trinidad and Tobago urges the international \r\ncommunity to work collaboratively towards reforming \r\nthe Security Council so that it can better address \r\ncurrent realities and challenges, including those faced \r\nby small island developing States, and so that it can \r\nimprove the effectiveness and credibility of the United \r\nNations with regard to the maintenance of peace and \r\ninternational security.\r\nThis year, the world has witnessed the unifying \r\npower of dialogue and understanding with the recent \r\nPanmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and \r\nthe Unification of the Korean Peninsula between \r\nthe Republic of Korea and the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. Trinidad and Tobago remains \r\noptimistic that that historic milestone will usher in a \r\nnew era of peace, cooperation and the denuclearization \r\nof the Korean peninsula.\r\nDespite that positive development, we must note \r\nthat. in our own region, the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba continues to stand as \r\nthe last vestige of the Cold War. In keeping with its \r\ncommitment to the Charter of the United Nations, and \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which \r\ncalls for no one to be left behind, the Government of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago reaffirms its persistent call for the \r\ntermination of the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba as soon as possible.\r\nAt the heart of our sovereign nations, our cultures \r\nand our languages lie individual beings who, at their \r\nvery core, seek a life of purpose, happiness and the \r\nopportunity to live in peace and prosperity. The challenge \r\nof our time is to pursue and achieve a sustainable future \r\nfor all in the face of burgeoning threats to our shared \r\nhumanity, including but not limited to the threats \r\nposed by extreme poverty, rising inequality, climate \r\nchange and protracted conflicts. Facing that challenge \r\nrequires deepened partnerships, meaningful dialogue \r\nand an appropriate review of established mechanisms \r\nand institutions that can, if reformed, exponentially \r\nimprove our ability to transform lives globally.\r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago remains \r\nunequivocally committed to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and to \r\nthe achievement of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. We commit to continuing \r\nto work in good faith with the United Nations, which \r\nhas long stood as the cornerstone of multilateralism in \r\nthe face of unprecedented challenges and threats facing \r\nhumanity, while ensuring that no one is left behind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al \r\nNahyan, Minister for Foreign Affairs and International \r\nCooperation of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nSheikh Al Nahyan (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, I would like to congratulate \r\nthe President on her election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session. I would also like \r\nto thank her predecessor for his outstanding work during \r\nthe previous session. Finally, I also want to convey my \r\ncountry’s appreciation of the valuable efforts being \r\nmade by Secretary-General António Guterres.\r\nThis year, the United Arab Emirates is celebrating \r\nthe centennial of the birth of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin \r\nSultan Al Nahyan, the founder of our union and a leader \r\nwhose vision entrenched the basis and values of the \r\nnoble humanity in my country and transformed it into \r\na successful political, economic and social model. As \r\nwe celebrate the centennial of the birth of our founding \r\nleader, we realize that we are not isolated from our \r\nsurroundings and that our success has increased our \r\nhumanitarian responsibilities as an Arab country \r\ntowards a region that faces numerous challenges.\r\nOver the past few years, we have witnessed major \r\nchanges in the international order, the consequences \r\nof which are becoming more apparent each day, most \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 51/53\r\nnotably the rise of armed terrorist groups that rely on \r\nextremist ideologies and seek to destabilize and control \r\ncountries. What is even more dangerous is the support \r\nthat rogue States are providing to such groups.\r\nAmid those dangerous challenges, which affect \r\nthe security and stability of every State, especially in \r\nour region, it has become imperative for us to be more \r\nactive in maintaining regional security by strengthening \r\npartnerships aimed at addressing current challenges. We \r\nrealize that we cannot continue to rely on other States \r\nto solve the crises in our region. No single country, \r\nregardless of its capabilities, can alone restore security \r\nand stability, because confronting the transnational \r\nchallenges that we face is a collective responsibility.\r\nIn our endeavour to achieve regional security and \r\nstability, my country has followed a comprehensive \r\napproach that addresses the various dimensions of the \r\nthreats in our region, which we believe can be summed \r\nup as the following four challenges. The first challenge \r\nis foreign interference in the affairs of the Arab world. \r\nCertain countries of the region, particularly Iran, seek \r\nto undermine the security of the region by spreading \r\nchaos, violence and sectarianism. Iran’s interference in \r\nArab affairs has reached an unprecedented level. Ever \r\nsince those threats reached Yemen and the Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia, which is a sister to all of us, we can no \r\nlonger afford to remain mere spectators. The Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia continues to be subjected to a barrage \r\nof Iranian ballistic missiles.\r\nThe security of countries in the region is \r\ninterdependent, and our security is tied to that of the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia. That is why we responded by \r\njoining the coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen, \r\nwhich seeks to put an end to the Houthi coup and \r\nconfront Iran’s interference. It is critical in that regard \r\nto differentiate between the behaviour of illegitimate \r\narmed groups that are committing serious violations \r\nand criminal and subversive acts in Yemen, such as \r\nthe Houthis, and the legitimate measures taken by \r\nthe coalition, which was formed at the request of the \r\nlegitimate Yemeni Government. The coalition’s goal \r\nis to restore stability by taking measured steps that \r\ntake into account humanitarian aspects and are in \r\naccordance with Security Council resolutions.\r\nDespite the coalition’s tireless efforts to restore \r\nstability in Yemen and alleviate the suffering of its \r\npeople, the intransigence of the Houthis in resisting \r\nserious peace initiatives, as proved by their absence \r\nfrom the recent Geneva talks, has exacerbated the \r\nhumanitarian situation in Yemen. The Houthis continue \r\nto obstruct humanitarian assistance and to receive \r\nIranian arms, plant landmines and recruit children. In \r\nthe light of those serious developments, the forces of the \r\ncoalition to support legitimacy in Yemen launched their \r\nmilitary operations in Yemen to liberate Al-Hudaydah \r\nfrom the grip of the Houthis in order to achieve a \r\nstrategic shift that would enhance the prospects for \r\nreaching a political solution. As the coalition carries \r\nout its operations in Al-Hudaydah and other areas in \r\nYemen, the humanitarian aspects have always been \r\ntaken into account. Hence, the Al-Hudaydah operation \r\nwas planned and implemented in accordance with \r\nour obligations under international law. We have also \r\nstrengthened and expanded our humanitarian aid and \r\nemergency relief.\r\nAt the same time as we are acting to counter the \r\nHouthis in the north of Yemen, my country will continue \r\nits fight against Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. \r\nThat terrorist group was severely impacted after the \r\ncoalition to support legitimacy in Yemen was able to \r\nseverely damage its forces, cut off its sources of finance \r\nand liberate the territories that were under its control.\r\nMistrust in Iran’s intentions and concerns regarding \r\nits regional ambitions are not limited to our region. Those \r\nconcerns were also reflected in the decision taken by \r\nthe United States to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear \r\nagreement and to reimpose sanctions on Iran, which \r\nhas never ceased its aggressive behaviour in the region \r\nor abandoned its intention to develop weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, even when the international community \r\ngranted it the opportunity to rectify its policies and \r\nbehaviour. In that regard, we stress the importance of a \r\nunited international position against Iran that addresses \r\nthat country’s development of ballistic missiles, its \r\nsupport for terrorist groups and its use of proxy wars to \r\nundermine regional and international security.\r\nThe second challenge that the region is facing \r\nis the spread of extremism and terrorism and the \r\nexploitation of modern technology by extremist and \r\nterrorist groups in order to disseminate their dangerous \r\nideologies. Although we have made some promising \r\nadvances against those extremist and terrorist groups \r\nin Syria, Iraq and Yemen and have liberated certain \r\ncities in Libya, our fight will continue until the scourge \r\nis eliminated.\r\nA/73/PV.14 29/09/2018\r\n52/53 18-30190\r\nThe situation is becoming more dangerous as some \r\nStates establish media platforms that incite hatred and \r\nserve as rostrums for extremist and terrorist groups. \r\nWe are facing extremist and terrorist ideologies \r\nthat are equally responsible for the acts of violence \r\ncommitted in the name of those ideologies. The United \r\nArab Emirates has therefore been at the forefront of \r\nStates combating extremism and terrorism in both the \r\nideological and the security realms. In addition, my \r\ncountry has supported international forces such as the \r\nGroup of Five for the Sahel joint force as part of our \r\nefforts to eliminate extremism and terrorism wherever \r\nit exists. My country has also established specialized \r\ninstitutions to counter extremist narratives, promote \r\ntolerance and disseminate a culture of accepting others \r\nand an optimistic vision at all national, regional and \r\ninternational levels.\r\nConvinced that lasting and global peace can be \r\nachieved only through peace between religions, the \r\nForum for Promoting Peace launched an international \r\ninitiative to build an alliance among the Abrahamic \r\nreligions and world philosophies. That alliance is based \r\non principles that transcend the paradigm of religious \r\narguments and conflicts. It is based on a paradigm \r\nof mutual recognition and cooperation, guided by \r\ninternational covenants and the spirit of our noble \r\nvalues and common virtues.\r\nWe stress that our values, which reject both \r\nextremism and terrorism, are steadfast and unchanging. \r\nWe emphasize that our policies to counter and combat \r\nthe supporters of extremism, violence and hatred make \r\nno distinction between a group and a State. To that end, \r\nthe United Arab Emirates, along with its brothers in the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Arab Republic of Egypt \r\nand the Kingdom of Bahrain, has taken sovereign \r\nmeasures against Qatar. Those measures are pivotal and \r\ndecisive in confronting extremism and terrorism, and \r\nare considered imperative to achieving a secure region.\r\nThe third challenge is posed by the prolonged crises \r\nin the region, which are merely managed in the absence \r\nof political solutions. In that regard, the United Arab \r\nEmirates will persist in supporting the existing political \r\ninitiatives, including by working with all United Nations \r\nenvoys. In that connection, the Palestinian question \r\ncontinues to wait for the international community to \r\nreach a comprehensive, lasting and just solution to \r\nend the suffering of our Palestinian brothers. We must \r\nunderscore that this continued humanitarian tragedy is \r\nbeing exploited by extremist groups and rogue States.\r\nLastly, we believe that the deterioration in the \r\neconomic, social and humanitarian conditions in the \r\nparts of our region is one of the main challenges we \r\nface. The successful experience of the United Arab \r\nEmirates has led us to believe that wise leadership, \r\nthe determination to achieve prosperity and a forward-\r\nlooking approach are key to building nations and \r\nprotecting them. My country’s foreign policy therefore \r\nincludes developmental, humanitarian and cultural \r\ndimensions in order to support the needs of the people \r\nand to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nAt the core of the development dimension is the \r\nstrengthening of economic opportunities and the \r\nempowerment of women and youth in countries affected \r\nby conflict. We believe that rebuilding Iraq is a prime \r\nexample of the importance of uniting efforts to help \r\ncountries recovering from conflict. The international \r\ncommunity has to support peaceful and inclusive \r\ncommunities, including through the protection of \r\nminorities and the prevention of atrocities committed \r\nagainst them, such as the crimes committed against the \r\nYazidis and the Rohingya.\r\nMy country is also playing a vital role in promoting \r\nhumanitarian and relief assistance to areas affected \r\nby conflicts and disasters around the world. The \r\nUnited Arab Emirates aspires to transform the whole \r\nregion into a global centre for technology, culture and \r\ninnovation after decades of crises. My country focuses \r\non anticipating challenges and on investing in advanced \r\nfields, such as artificial intelligence, space technology \r\nand renewable energy. I would like to emphasize \r\nthat empowering women and youth and investing in \r\ntheir unlimited skills contribute to building resilient \r\nand cohesive societies and, eventually, stable and \r\nsafe countries.\r\nToday, our Arab region is in dire need of a \r\ncomprehensive regional transformation that will bring \r\nit out of chaos and into stability, and out of isolation and \r\nunilateralism into openness and planning for the future. \r\nWe are cognizant that achieving that transformation \r\nwill not be easy and that our efforts will succeed only by \r\nintensifying collective action. Most importantly, each \r\nState must fulfil its responsibilities to reach that goal.\r\nI would like to underscore the vital role of the \r\nUnited Nations in supporting political processes, \r\nstrengthening dialogue and building confidence among \r\nGovernments so as to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity, especially given the worrying uncertainty \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.14\r\n18-30190 53/53\r\nthat currently defines the international order. The \r\nUnited Arab Emirates views the historic agreement \r\nreached between Ethiopia and Eritrea, under the \r\nauspices of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as \r\nsignificant motivation for the international community \r\nto strengthen its diplomatic efforts.\r\nIn addition, the international community must \r\ntake a firm and consistent stance towards States that \r\nhave hostile policies and violate international law and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. The United Arab \r\nEmirates reiterates its demand for its legitimate right \r\nto sovereignty over its three islands — Greater Tunb, \r\nLesser Tunb and Abu Musa, which Iran has occupied for \r\n47 years, in f lagrant violation of international law and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. We call once again \r\nupon Iran from this rostrum to respond to our repeated \r\ncalls and return our rights to where they belong, either \r\nvoluntarily or through the available peaceful means for \r\nresolving international disputes, at the top of which are \r\ndirect negotiations or referral to the International Court \r\nof Justice or international arbitration.\r\nI would like to emphasize that the vision of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates for the region is based on the \r\nvalues upon which our country was founded, the \r\npositive outcomes already achieved by my country at \r\nthe national level, and our regional experiences in the \r\nregion side by side with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, \r\nwith whom we share an optimistic vision and hope \r\nfor achieving a brighter future for our region and for \r\nall peoples.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.30 p.m.\r\n"
