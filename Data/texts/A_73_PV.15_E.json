"United Nations A/73/PV.15\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n15th plenary meeting\r\nSaturday, 29 September 2018, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mrs. Gueguen \r\n(France), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.30 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, \r\nPresident of Turkmenistan\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President \r\nof Turkmenistan.\r\nMr. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, President \r\nof Turkmenistan, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Gurbanguly \r\nBerdimuhamedov, President of Turkmenistan, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Berdimuhamedov (spoke in Russian): \r\nI would first like to congratulate Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés on her election to the post of President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, \r\nand to wish her success in her important work. I would \r\nalso like to express my appreciation to Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák, President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session, for his skilled and effective \r\nefforts in the position.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is \r\ntaking place against a background of complex trends \r\nin international politics. In spite of the efforts of the \r\ninternational community, particularly through the \r\nUnited Nations, the situation in a number of regions \r\naround the world remains very difficult. Conflict-prone \r\nareas have spread, while at the same time the general \r\nlevel of trust and mutual understanding in our views \r\non the pathways and prospects for global development \r\nhas fallen. In such circumstances, the issue of ensuring \r\ncomprehensive, solid and long-term security becomes \r\nall too apparent and pertinent, laying the responsibility \r\nfor the destiny of humankind at the door of every State.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations is called on to play \r\nthe main and decisive role in preserving the foundations \r\nof our international order on the basis of the principles \r\nof mutual respect, equality and peaceful political \r\ndialogue. There can be no doubt as to the legitimacy \r\nof its mission. It is the only universal international \r\norganization designed to ensure multilateral cooperation \r\naimed at strengthening international security and \r\nsustainable development. Turkmenistan believes that \r\nthis session of the General Assembly should help \r\nto resolve the crisis of trust and strengthen mutual \r\nunderstanding among the States Members of the United \r\nNations. In that regard Turkmenistan is launching an \r\ninitiative marking 2019 as a year of peace and trust. \r\nOur initiative proposes developing specific measures \r\naimed at reducing tensions and promoting the peaceful \r\npolitical and diplomatic resolution of disputes and \r\nclashes by adopting responsible and balanced decisions.\r\nEnsuring long-term security is a key issue for \r\nCentral Asian States, and one of the most important \r\nissues on the regional agenda is the fight against \r\nterrorism. With regard to ensuring security and stable \r\ndevelopment in the Central Asian States, cooperation \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

In that regard we believe it is crucial \r\nto involve Afghanistan in implementing major energy, \r\ntransport and communications projects as a full-\r\nf ledged partner. We see that issue as one of strategic \r\nimportance for Afghanistan and its role in regional and \r\nglobal processes, and one that will help the Afghan \r\npeople’s prosperity and well-being to f lourish. We \r\nare working steadily towards that goal. My country is \r\nworking to implement the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-\r\nPakistan-India pipeline project, building a power \r\nsupply line and a fibre-optic communications network \r\nwith the support of international partners and major \r\nfinancial institutions. A new railway leading towards \r\nAfghanistan has also been completed. We continue to \r\nprovide Afghanistan with humanitarian assistance by \r\nbuilding social facilities, sending humanitarian aid \r\nconvoys and training qualified national specialists \r\nfor various sectors of Afghanistan’s economic and \r\nsocial arenas.\r\nTurkmenistan participated actively in the drafting \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nmade a number of specific proposals. Following the \r\nadoption at the World Summit of the 2030 Agenda and \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 (see \r\nA/70/PV.4), our country was one of the first nations \r\nto begin adapting its national plans and social and \r\neconomic development programmes in line with the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. In that regard we have \r\nestablished an appropriate permanent mechanism for \r\ncooperation with the United Nations. Turkmenistan’s \r\nimplementation of the SDGs focuses particularly on \r\nsocial aspects. That means such important issues \r\nas ensuring food security and improving nutrition, \r\ncomprehensively promoting a healthy way of life, \r\nensuring full gender equality by guaranteeing rights \r\nand opportunities for all women and girls and creating \r\nthe conditions for comprehensive, equitable and high-\r\nquality education.\r\nWe are also devoting a great deal of attention to \r\nachieving the goal of ensuring the availability and \r\nintelligent use of water resources and sanitation for \r\nall. Turkmenistan firmly adheres to the principle that \r\nwater is the common heritage of every people on our \r\nplanet and that equal and fair access to clean drinking \r\nwater is a fundamental human right. The development \r\nof States on the economic and social fronts, as well as \r\ntheir peoples’ levels of well-being and quality of life, is \r\ndirectly dependent on their access to water resources \r\nand ability to use them effectively. Equal rights, \r\nmutual respect and responsibility should therefore \r\nbe the main criteria determining relations among the \r\nStates of Central Asian. In consistently taking that \r\nposition, Turkmenistan has always declared that issues \r\nrelated to water and energy in our region should be \r\nresolved, first, on a basis of generally accepted norms \r\nof international law; secondly, by taking the interests \r\nof each country into account; and thirdly, with the \r\nactive participation of international organizations and \r\nthe United Nations in particular. That is our principled \r\nposition, and based on it we will continue working to \r\nestablish effective negotiating mechanisms between \r\nStates and international entities with a view to arriving \r\nat a coordinated approach. I believe firmly that this is \r\nthe only way we can achieve positive results and ensure \r\na stable and sustainable balance of interests.\r\nOne of the major topics of cooperation between \r\nthe countries of our region and the international \r\ncommunity is the problem of saving the Aral Sea. It \r\nhas long been clear that its preservation cannot be \r\nconsidered merely a problem internal to the region. If \r\nwe are to succeed in finding a solution to it we need \r\nthe help of the world community and an innovative, \r\ncomprehensive international approach involving the \r\nactive and systematic participation of the United \r\nNations. In that regard, Turkmenistan has begun to \r\nimplement an initiative formulating a special United \r\nNations programme for the problem of the Aral Sea \r\nbasin and establishing it as a specific separate area \r\nof the Organization’s work. I urge Member States \r\nto support our proposal, for which the Assembly’s \r\nresolution 72/273, on “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the International Fund for Saving the Aral \r\nSea”, adopted by consensus on 12 April, could serve as \r\na good basis.\r\nAnother major issue is the Caspian Sea. The signing \r\nby the Heads of States of the Caspian Sea on 12 August \r\nof the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian \r\nSea has opened up the prospects for transforming the \r\nCaspian Sea region into an internationally important \r\nstrategic transit and energy hub, as well as an area for \r\nbroad investment, trade and economic activity and \r\ncooperation. Turkmenistan is ready for meaningful \r\ndiscussions with all interested parties on implementing \r\nprojects in those areas that are fully economically \r\nand commercially feasible, beneficial for all potential \r\nparticipants, capable of significantly helping to \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 3/38\r\nstrengthen the security of the continent and long-term \r\nin nature. It is no exaggeration to say that investing in \r\nsuch projects is undoubtedly an investment in the future.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the effective participation \r\nof the United Nations specialized agencies represented \r\nin Turkmenistan and in our country’s life, dynamic \r\ndevelopment and people’s welfare, and I would like \r\nto express our sincere gratitude to their staff for their \r\nself less work. I would also like to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral António Guterres for his tireless personal focus \r\non United Nations cooperation with Turkmenistan and \r\nhis support to our initiatives and endeavours.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof Turkmenistan for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, President of \r\nTurkmenistan, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Jan Hamáček, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister, Minister of the Interior and Acting Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic.\r\nMr. Hamáček (Czech Republic): Despite all our \r\nefforts, 100 years after the end of the First World War \r\nwe find ourselves in a world in which lasting peace \r\nhas not yet been universally secured and people are \r\nstill dying in violent conflicts. The raison d’être of \r\nthe United Nations is the protection of peace, human \r\nrights, justice and social progress. Those values are not \r\na Western instrument. They form universal ideals that \r\nall of us, the States Members of the United Nations, \r\nshould strive for together.\r\nWe face many challenges in areas such as the \r\ndignity of individuals, global prosperity, and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, including gender inequality, youth \r\nunemployment, global health threats, climate change, \r\nviolent extremism, terrorism, forced displacement and \r\nuncontrolled migration. Furthermore, multilateralism \r\nand the rules-based system, which benefit everyone \r\nand have long held many of those threats at bay, are \r\nincreasingly being undermined and questioned. One \r\nway that we as policymakers can tackle those challenges \r\nis by working to realize the difficult structural and \r\npolitical reforms of the United Nations so as to promote \r\nshared global responsibility, robust international \r\ncooperation and the restoration of common values.\r\nWe all understand the importance of reforming \r\nthe Security Council in order to reflect the realities \r\nof today’s world. In recent years, unfortunately, the \r\nCouncil has been characterized by blocking tactics \r\nrather than cooperation. Its failure to act on the world’s \r\nworst atrocities is clearly visible in several brutal \r\nongoing conflicts, from Syria to Yemen. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has already embarked on the challenging \r\nendeavour of reforming the United Nations, and the \r\nCzech Republic fully supports his efforts. Making the \r\nOrganization more effective through much-needed \r\nreforms in the areas of peace and security, management \r\nand the development system will make the United \r\nNations truly relevant to all people and help promote a \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable world. Accordingly, \r\nwe should endorse the Secretary-General’s work and \r\ngive his proposals, including their budgetary and \r\nfinancial implications, the strongest possible support.\r\nThe vital point of the Secretary-General’s reform \r\nagenda is its focus on the prevention of conflicts. All of \r\nus should work tirelessly work to ensure that crises are \r\ncontained before they break out and that post-conflict \r\ncountries are stabilized for the long term. For effective \r\nconflict prevention, we should adopt a comprehensive \r\napproach to peace and security that treats climate \r\nchange as a security problem while also advancing \r\nsustainable development and promoting human rights.\r\nThe Czech Republic took great pride in having \r\nthe honour of holding the presidency of the Economic \r\nand Social Council during its 2017 session. I would \r\nlike to thank everyone, Member States as well as the \r\nSecretariat, for their excellent cooperation. It was an \r\nenlightening experience, not just for our presidency \r\nteam but for our entire Administration.\r\nIn the context of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, which are the foundation of our concerted \r\nefforts to promote sustainable development, the Czech \r\nRepublic will continue to champion Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 16, not only as a follow-up to \r\nour presidency of the Economic and Social Council \r\nbut mainly as a cornerstone of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. We consider peace, justice \r\nand functioning institutions our priority and a solid \r\nbase on which a sustainable future for everyone can \r\nbe built. In the context of sustainable development, \r\nit is also crucial for the United Nations to seek more \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n4/38 18-30196\r\nsynergies among its humanitarian, development and \r\nsecurity activities.\r\nApart from conflict prevention, there should be \r\na special focus on post-conflict stabilization. Those \r\nefforts should be visible in the field. To achieve that, \r\nmore cooperation among the United Nations specialized \r\nagencies is required, as well as broader coordination \r\nwith and between the Member States.\r\nHistory teaches us that respect for human rights is \r\nthe best way to prevent conflict and violence. Efforts \r\nto realize human rights for all are the best possible \r\ninvestment for a peaceful and prosperous future. \r\nLasting peace and sustainable development cannot be \r\nachieved when human rights are abused or violated. \r\nAnd yet the human rights pillar of the United Nations \r\nis chronically underfunded and often overlooked. That \r\nmust change. Human rights are central to my historical \r\nexperience. The promotion of human rights, both in the \r\nbilateral context and on the global scene, remains one \r\nof our long-term foreign-policy priorities.\r\nOur efforts to prevent conflict and instability would \r\nnot be complete without mentioning denuclearization \r\nand the fight against terrorism. The Czech Republic, \r\nwith its Embassy in Pyongyang, is deeply interested in \r\nimproving the situation on the Korean peninsula. That \r\nis why we are following both the inter-Korean dialogue \r\nand the dialogue between the United States of America \r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea with \r\nraised expectations and at the highest level.\r\nWe need a resolute and coordinated approach \r\nto countering the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, just as we do in fighting terrorism. \r\nAlthough the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant has \r\nbeen defeated in large swaths of territory in Syria and \r\nIraq, we are aware that it is still active and that other \r\nterrorist organizations are also operating worldwide. \r\nWe must take further steps in the area of international \r\nlaw and finally conclude a comprehensive convention \r\non international terrorism. As President Miloš Zeman \r\nsuggested at the general debate of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session in 2016 (see A/71/PV.12), \r\nwe call for an internationally recognized definition \r\nof terrorism that will emphasizee the criminal \r\nresponsibility of terrorists worldwide and enable us to \r\nhold them accountable.\r\nThis year the Czech Republic commemorates the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the day that Warsaw Pact troops \r\ninvaded Czechoslovakia. The experience of the 1968 \r\ninvasion still resonates strongly, and not just in the \r\nCzech Republic, as the moment where many lost faith \r\nin the promises of a better world preached by the Soviet \r\nUnion. That historical time period provides lessons that \r\nare still relevant today, and its echoes can be heard in \r\nincidents that continue to occur in the world around us.\r\nFirst, it is still not a given that all countries, \r\nincluding those in Eastern Europe, have the right to \r\nchoose their foreign-policy orientation without their \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity being threatened. \r\nIn that context, I would like to once again remind the \r\nAssembly that the annexation of Crimea represents a \r\nblatant violation of international law.\r\nSecondly, it should not be forgotten that the use of \r\nforce is allowed by the Charter of the United Nations \r\nonly in self-defence and when authorized by the \r\nSecurity Council under Chapter VII of the Charter. The \r\nUnited Nations is the sole guarantor of international \r\npeace and security. It is only through collective means \r\nand within the rules-based international order that the \r\npeace and security of all our nations can be achieved.\r\nThirdly, in cases where States and the international \r\ncommunity fail in their shared responsibility to protect \r\npeople from atrocities, it is imperative to establish \r\naccountability for serious violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights. Accordingly, the \r\nCzech Republic firmly supports international criminal \r\njustice, and in particular the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC). We welcome the activation of the ICC’s \r\njurisdiction over the crime of aggression, which we \r\nconsider to be a deterrent ensuring that such crimes will \r\nnot be committed in future. In certain cases, however, \r\nthe ICC does not have jurisdiction, but that should not \r\nbe seen as a loophole through which perpetrators of \r\natrocities may escape accountability.\r\nFor crimes committed in Syria, we support, both \r\npolitically and through financial contributions, the \r\nso-called International, Impartial and Independent \r\nMechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution \r\nof Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes \r\nunder International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic since March 2011. Not only is accountability a \r\nway to bring justice to those suffering in conflicts, it is \r\nalso a path towards reconciliation and a crucial means \r\nfor preventing atrocities from recurring.\r\nWhile the newly independent Czech Republic was \r\nadmitted to the United Nations 25 years ago, in 1993, \r\nthis year we are also celebrating the centenary of our \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 5/38\r\nmodern statehood and independence, as Czechoslovakia \r\nwas born out of the crucible of the First World War in \r\n1918. The founder and first President of my country, \r\nTomáš Garrigue Masaryk, rightly posited that States \r\nare sustained only by those ideals from which they \r\nwere born. The same must be true of the United \r\nNations. We should therefore strive to reinvigorate the \r\nfounding ideals of this noble Organization. Only then \r\nwill we succeed in fulfilling the theme of its seventy-\r\nthird session, making it truly relevant and helpful to \r\nall people.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Saleumxay Kommasith, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic.\r\nMr. Kommasith (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): First of all, I would like to begin by \r\ncongratulating Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés \r\non her election as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-third session. It is a great pleasure to see \r\na woman presiding over the Assembly. I want to assure \r\nher of our full support and cooperation and wish her \r\nevery success in carrying out her noble duty. I would \r\nalso like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák on his successful completion of his tenure as \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its seventy-second session.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich promises to leave no one behind, encompasses \r\nall of the prerequisites for building a peaceful and \r\nprosperous world. In order to meet the lofty goals \r\nof the 2030 Agenda, national Governments and the \r\ninternational community have to work hand in hand for \r\nits implementation. That requires international peace \r\nand security, which creates an environment conducive to \r\neconomic growth and social progress while enhancing \r\ninternational cooperation and assistance, with priority \r\ngiven to the most vulnerable groups of countries, which \r\nare the least-developed countries (LDCs), land-locked \r\ndeveloping countries and small island developing States.\r\nSoon after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, in order to realize it and \r\nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the \r\nGovernment of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nincorporated the SDG targets into its eighth national \r\nfive-year socioeconomic development plan, for the \r\nperiod from 2016 to 2020. Given our specific needs, \r\nwe have gone the extra mile by adopting a national \r\nsustainable development goal 18, “Lives safe from \r\nunexploded ordnance”, in order to address the problems \r\ncaused by unexploded ordnance.\r\nAt the High-level Political Forum in July, the Lao \r\nGovernment presented its first voluntary national \r\nreview on SDG implementation, which has seen \r\nimportant progress and emerging constraints in the \r\npast few years. While we have seen positive momentum \r\ntowards achieving the SDGs, bringing us closer to \r\ngraduation from our LDC status, we remain vulnerable \r\nto external shocks. This year we have been witnessing \r\nan increasing intensity in climate change and natural \r\ndisasters, causing heavy losses and damage to the lives \r\nand property of people in various parts of the world. \r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic is no exception. \r\nWe have been severely affected by natural disasters, \r\nespecially extensive f looding across the country, the \r\nworst-ever natural disaster in our history. To date \r\n2,409 of 8,464 villages in 115 of 148 districts have \r\nbeen affected by massive f looding. The exact costs of \r\nthe losses and damage are as yet unknown, as a post-\r\ndisaster needs assessment will be conducted in the next \r\nfew months. The calamity has had a severe impact on \r\nthe livelihoods of people in the affected areas.\r\nWith the assistance of friendly countries and \r\ninternational organizations, including international \r\nnon-governmental organizations and individuals, the \r\nLao Government has been providing those affected \r\nwith emergency relief in the form of temporary shelters, \r\nfood and health care. I would therefore like to take this \r\nopportunity to express our heartfelt appreciation and \r\ngratitude to the friendly countries and international \r\norganizations that have given us valuable assistance \r\nduring this difficult time.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, it is more crucial than ever \r\nfor world leaders to honour their commitments pledged \r\nunder the Paris Agreement. Within the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), great importance \r\nhas been accorded to the issue of climate change \r\nand disaster-risk management. We also very much \r\nappreciate the continued support of the United Nations \r\nfor the ASEAN-United Nations Joint Strategic Plan of \r\nAction on Disaster Management, for the period from \r\n2016 to 2020, which is designed to address climate \r\nchange and disaster management and respond to the \r\neffects of the changing climate on socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment in years to come.\r\nAddressing the scourge of transnational crime \r\nrequires concerted effort at all levels. In that context, \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n6/38 18-30196\r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic remains seriously \r\ncommitted to working closely with the international \r\ncommunity on the fight against illicit drugs, the illegal \r\ntrade in wildlife and trafficking in persons, among \r\nother things. The Government has adopted a drug-\r\ncontrol master plan for the period from 2016 to 2020, \r\nas we implement the ASEAN Work Plan on Securing \r\nCommunities against Illicit Drugs for the period from \r\n2016 to 2025 so as to realize the vision of a drug-free \r\nASEAN as one of the region’s high-priority agenda \r\nitems. We are also pleased to support the Global Call \r\nto Action on the World Drug Problem initiated by the \r\nPresident of the United States.\r\nThe Lao Government has spared no effort in \r\ncombating the heinous and inhumane crime of human \r\ntrafficking by adopting various laws, regulations and \r\nnational action plans to combat trafficking in persons \r\nand by becoming a signatory to numerous regional \r\nagreements and memorandums of understanding, \r\nincluding the ASEAN Convention against Trafficking \r\nin Persons, Especially Women and Children, which \r\nseek to prevent and combat human trafficking.\r\nThe United Nations needs to be strengthened so \r\nthat it can respond effectively to the challenges we face \r\ntoday. We are pleased with the Secretary-General’s \r\ninitiatives on reforming and repositioning the United \r\nNations, with the aim of improving the capacity of \r\nthe United Nations to meet the needs in the current \r\nenvironment. In that context, we reiterate our view that \r\ndevelopment issues must remain a core and integral \r\npart of the United Nations and its States Members and \r\na top priority for them, alongside the promotion of \r\ninternational peace, security and human rights and an \r\nemphasis on the importance of enhancing the United \r\nNations system’s ability to deliver on its mandate.\r\nWe are concerned about the continued decline in \r\ncontributions to the core funding of United Nations \r\ndevelopment agencies and the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme on the ground. My delegation \r\nwould therefore like to call once again on donor \r\ncountries and development partners to fulfil their \r\nofficial development assistance commitment of at least \r\n0.7 per cent of their gross national income.\r\nWe all acknowledge that peace and security are \r\nprerequisites for the socioeconomic development of all \r\nnations. We must therefore maintain and promote peace \r\nand security at all costs. Past experience has shown that \r\nsettling disputes by peaceful means is the best way to \r\nensure the durable peace that is essential for a nation’s \r\nsustainable development. Accordingly, it is incumbent \r\non the international community to continue to build \r\nmutual trust and confidence in an effort to jointly \r\novercome their current challenges and seek peaceful \r\nsolutions to the disputes and conflicts that we are \r\nwitnessing in various regions of the world.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, we welcomed the recent \r\nhistoric summit in June between the leaders of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United \r\nStates of America, which constituted an important \r\nmilestone in the relations between the two countries. \r\nWe also welcomed the third summit between the \r\nleaders of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, with the objective of \r\nstriving not only to improve bilateral relations between \r\nthe two countries but also to address the issue of the \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula. We hope that \r\nsuch positive momentum will be strengthened, thereby \r\ncontributing to the maintenance of peace and stability \r\nand denuclearization in the region as a whole.\r\nDespite those positive developments on the Korean \r\npeninsula, my delegation is concerned about the lack \r\nof progress on the Palestinian question. We hope that \r\nits long-overdue resolution can be achieved by peaceful \r\nmeans with the goal of arriving at a two-State solution \r\nwhereby Palestine and Israel can live side by side in \r\npeace and security within internationally recognized \r\nborders, in accordance with the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nOn another note, in an era of interdependence, \r\ninternational cooperation and engagement are key \r\nfactors to peaceful and mutually beneficial coexistence. \r\nEnforced isolation and the imposition of sanctions \r\non any country will not necessarily benefit the \r\ninternational community. On the contrary, it will result \r\nin losses for all and increased hostility. My delegation \r\ntherefore urges for an end to the embargo on Cuba. \r\nWe also want to call on the international community \r\nto uphold and further strengthen multilateralism that \r\npromotes cooperation rather than confrontation, which \r\nremains one of the core values of our only universal \r\norganization, the United Nations.\r\nMs. Scott (Namibia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nI would like to conclude by expressing my support \r\nfor the theme of the seventy-third session of the General \r\nAssembly — “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 7/38\r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies” — which \r\nis indeed pertinent to the current global situation and \r\nthe work of the United Nations. However, making all \r\ninternationally agreed goals and commitments a reality \r\nrequires strong political will and firm commitment \r\nand support to multilateralism, particularly in terms \r\nof making the United Nations stronger so that it \r\ncan effectively serve and respond to the needs of all \r\nMember States.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Wilfred Elrington, Attorney General and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Belize.\r\nMr. Elrington (Belize): At the outset, I would like \r\nto express the sympathies of the Government and the \r\npeople of Belize with the Government and the people \r\nof Indonesia in the light of the recent devastating \r\nearthquake and tsunami that has killed more than \r\n400 people. I also want to express our solidarity \r\nwith Barbados and Saint Lucia, fellow Caribbean \r\nCommunity countries, which are recovering from \r\nTropical Storm Kirk, as well as with the countries of \r\nthe Eastern Caribbean that have been affected by an \r\nearthquake in the past few days.\r\nThis year marks the thirty-seventh anniversary of \r\nBelize’s independence. Belizeans have now enjoyed \r\nalmost four uninterrupted decades of freedom, peace \r\nand democracy in our sovereign independent nation. \r\nDuring that period our leaders have succeeded in making \r\nmodest gains in our nation’s quest for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. They did so notwithstanding the fact that \r\nour country has been the subject of an active territorial \r\nclaim — a poisoned colonial chalice — that predates our \r\nindependence by approximately a half century. Because \r\nof that claim, our nation’s birth was protracted and \r\nfraught with difficulty. All Belizeans who are familiar \r\nwith the history of our journey to independence give \r\nthe United Nations great credit for it, and rightly so. \r\nIt was resolution 1514 (XV), adopted on 14 December \r\n1960, that paved the way for all colonial peoples to be \r\nable to make the transition to independence. Belize \r\nis a beneficiary of that seminal resolution and of the \r\nsubsequent United Nations resolutions adopted between \r\n1971 and 1980 that mandated the British to grant it \r\nearly independence.\r\nOn 21 September 1981, Belize achieved its \r\nindependence, and the United Nations immediately \r\nwelcomed our f ledgling democratic State as its newest \r\nMember, thereby affirming its sovereignty and its \r\nterritorial integrity. Yet 37 years later the Guatemalan \r\nterritorial claim remains unresolved. Indeed, efforts to \r\nresolve it before the International Court of Justice eluded \r\nthe British Government for nearly 80 years. However, \r\nBelizeans will soon — and thankfully — decide whether \r\nthe current opportunity to bring about a definitive \r\nsettlement of the claim, which has long sown fear in the \r\nhearts of all Belizeans and has hamstrung our nation’s \r\ndevelopment potential, will in fact be seized.\r\nThe significance of the 15 April 2017 Guatemalan \r\nreferendum, which ratified the decision of the \r\nGuatemalan Government in 2008 to have its claim \r\nrelating to my country adjudicated by the Court, \r\nshould not be lost. For, in carrying out the referendum, \r\nGuatemala gave effect to its obligation under the \r\nspecial agreement that both our countries signed in \r\ngood faith. At the same time, there remains one pending \r\nissue for us to agree on. In continuing that spirit of \r\ngood faith, we urge our neighbour Guatemala to agree \r\non a procedure or protocol for confidence-building \r\nmeasures on the Sarstoon River, our southern boundary \r\nwith that country, in order to facilitate the management \r\nof incidents of the kind that gave rise to heightened \r\ntensions between our two countries in 2015 and 2016.\r\nBelizeans are now on the cusp of a truly rare and \r\nfelicitous moment in our nation’s history. Our voting \r\npublic, in the finest democratic fashion, now has a \r\nonce-in-a-lifetime opportunity to determine the fate of \r\nour country. The Government of Belize has designated \r\n10 April 2019 as the date for our national referendum. \r\nOn that day all registered voters will be entitled to cast \r\ntheir ballots, thereby signalling either their consent to \r\nor rejection of having the Guatemalan claim resolved \r\nonce and for all by the International Court of Justice. In \r\npreparation for that historic plebiscite, our Government \r\nhas embarked on a nationwide public awareness \r\ncampaign to ensure that all Belizeans are fully informed \r\nabout the claim and why it should be referred to the \r\nCourt for resolution.\r\nWhile working to end the Guatemalan claim and \r\nthereby enhance our national security, my Government \r\ncontinues to discharge its core duty of promoting \r\neconomic development, job creation, education and \r\nhealth care for all citizens. To that end, we are making \r\nmajor efforts to implement our growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment strategy, which is fully aligned with the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. In that endeavour \r\nthe United Nations development system is partnering \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n8/38 18-30196\r\nwith us through the Multi-country Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Framework.\r\nWe are also working diligently to address the scourge \r\nof the poverty that persistently afflicts our country and \r\nour citizens. Current statistics show that approximately \r\n43 per cent of Belizeans live below the poverty line, with \r\n16 per cent experiencing extreme poverty. Initiatives \r\naimed at dealing with the problem include three new \r\nprogrammes that specifically target indigent families. In \r\naddition to financial benefits, beneficiaries are provided \r\nwith direct economic, social and psychological support \r\nas well as job readiness courses to prepare them for \r\ngainful employment. Under a food pantry programme, \r\npoor families are also provided with basic food baskets \r\nat subsidized rates.\r\nAn alarming knowledge gap is rapidly widening \r\nbetween the few fortunate Belizeans who are well \r\neducated, skilled and poised to succeed in a fiercely \r\ncompetitive, knowledge-based twenty-first century \r\nenvironment and the many who are being left behind \r\nwithout the skills and wherewithal to obtain employment, \r\nbecome self-employed or even to engage legitimately and \r\nmeaningfully in civic life. It is indispensable to Belize’s \r\ndevelopment, prosperity, security and democracy that \r\nwe work to close that knowledge gap as soon as possible \r\nand ensure that all our young people are equipped to \r\nsuccessfully face the myriad challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nTo that end, and with a view to increasing access to \r\neducation, our Government is building 35 new schools. \r\nSince the launch of a high school subsidy, we have seen \r\na discernible improvement in transition rates from \r\nprimary to secondary school for students identified \r\nas having academic or socioeconomic challenges. All \r\nstudents in the country’s districts and rural areas with \r\nthe highest incidence of poverty automatically qualify \r\nfor the subsidy. This year the Government is expanding \r\nits reach with the intention of minimizing the disparity \r\nin enrolment and achievement between students from \r\nrural and urban areas.\r\nIn addition, the Government is taking new measures \r\nto assist at-risk young people from coming into conflict \r\nwith our laws. We recently launched the Belize Youth \r\nChallenge Programme, which concentrates on teaching \r\nyoung people discipline, personal organization \r\nand teamwork, as well as skills in technical and \r\nvocational areas, and on encouraging them to become \r\nresponsible, patriotic and productive citizens. With a \r\nview to enhancing the delivery of health services, the \r\nGovernment has initiated steps for the construction of a \r\nmodern hospital in the Toledo district.\r\nNext year will mark 25 years of the Organization’s \r\nsupport for the small island developing States (SIDS) \r\nagenda. Belize joins in the call for renewed commitment \r\nto the special case of SIDS and for systematically \r\ntargeted support to respond to their particular needs, \r\nsuch as those identified by the Caribbean SIDS in the \r\nSan Pedro Declaration, adopted in Belize in August \r\n2017. The destructive hurricanes and storms that ravage \r\nthe Caribbean year after year are a constant reminder \r\nof the true scale of thevulnerability facing SIDS in the \r\nCaribbean. We hope that through the implementation \r\nof his reform plan the Secretary-General will explore \r\nways by which the United Nations development \r\nsystem can better accelerate the implementation of the \r\nSIDS agenda.\r\nOur Government has made building resilience \r\nan integral part of its development planning and is \r\nimplementing a national climate resilience investment \r\nplan to ensure that the impact of climate change is \r\nintegrated into national investment planning across all \r\nsectors and ministries. The Government has also enacted \r\nmangrove regulations and instituted an indefinite \r\nmoratorium on offshore drilling, which marks the first \r\ntime that a developing country has taken such a major \r\nstep to protect its marine resources from oil exploration \r\nand extraction. Belize will also be banning single-use \r\nplastics and Styrofoam as of April 2019.\r\nI am happy to share that UNESCO’s World Heritage \r\nCommittee recently decided to remove the Belize \r\nbarrier reef, the largest in the western hemisphere, \r\nfrom the World Heritage in Danger list, after taking \r\ninto account several measures that our Government has \r\nimplemented to ensure its protection and well-being.\r\nThanks to its geography, Belize is located along a \r\npath frequented by criminal elements of every kind as \r\nthey journey from South to North to traffic their illicit \r\nwares, a fact that has had tragic consequences for the \r\npeace and safety of Belizeans. Over the past decade the \r\nproblem has led to a dramatic increase in our homicide \r\nrates, with each year being deadlier than the one before. \r\nTackling transnational organized crime in Central \r\nAmerica requires a truly cooperative and collaborative \r\napproach, along with multilateral support. Thankfully, \r\nUNICEF, the United Nations Development Programme \r\nand the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 9/38\r\nhave been important and faithful collaborators with our \r\nGovernment in implementing programmes to address \r\nunderlying social causes and build the capacity of \r\nprotective and judicial institutions.\r\nWhat I have spoken of here makes it clear that the \r\nUnited Nations is of inestimable value and importance \r\nto Belize. Like other States Members of the United \r\nNations, Belize is well aware of its limitations, but it is \r\nnot without anxiety that we note the fact that some of \r\nits core values are under sustained attack, while organs \r\nthat have been painstakingly erected to reinforce the \r\nrule of law are being derided and international legal \r\nframeworks are being cast aside in unilateral acts of \r\npolitical expediency.\r\nParadoxically, the criticisms and attacks are being \r\nunleashed at a time when the world is most in need of \r\na robust United Nations, as nations large and small are \r\nbeing buffeted by catastrophic occurrences, both natural \r\nand man-made, at a pace never before witnessed by \r\nhumankind. While we appreciate the need for reform of \r\nthe institutions of the United Nations, we are therefore \r\nequally mindful of its unique and invaluable role in \r\na world that is becoming increasingly more perilous. \r\nBelize fears that, if we stand in silence or fail to speak \r\nout in its defence and in defence of multilateralism, \r\nwe risk repeating the tragedies of the past, and we \r\nforsake the very values that the United Nations stands \r\nfor. Indeed, we forsake our very responsibility to \r\nhumankind. History will measure us by our actions, \r\nnot by our words.\r\nBelize supports all initiatives that seek to put an \r\nend to the conflicts languishing across the globe that \r\nlead to senseless death, destruction and suffering. We \r\necho the cry of Palestinians for an independent State, \r\nwithin its 1967 borders and with all attendant rights. \r\nWe pray that the International Court of Justice will \r\nbring a speedy end to Venezuela’s claim over Guyanan \r\nterritory. Belize remains firm and unwavering in its \r\nsupport for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nGuyana. We also pray that the civil strife in Venezuela \r\nwill soon end.\r\nBelize joins the call for an end to the unilateral, \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba \r\nand its people, which violates international law and \r\nserves no just purpose. The blockade has failed to \r\npressure the Government into submission. Indeed, it \r\nhas had the opposite effect. Leveraging its inexhaustible \r\nreserves of patriotism and creativity, Cuba has been \r\nable to survive and thrive to a degree that has garnered \r\ninternational recognition for its resilience, its self less \r\ngenerosity and its signal gains in public health, \r\neducation and the arts. Surely it is high time, after \r\nnearly 58 years, to lift the blockade so that Cuba can \r\nreach the highest level of its extraordinary potential.\r\nIn a similar spirit of determination, Belize reiterates \r\nits plea on behalf of the 23 million people of Taiwan for \r\na new approach to Taiwan’s participation in the United \r\nNations system. Taiwan is the twenty-second-largest \r\neconomy in the world. It is a vibrant democracy that \r\nhas fully embraced international norms and standards. \r\nYet, despite global recognition of its successes and the \r\nreadiness of States Members of the United Nations \r\nto conduct business with this fast-growing economy, \r\nthe Organization has cut them off. It has gone so far \r\nas to refuse to recognize the legitimacy of Taiwanese \r\npassports, thereby even preventing Taiwanese tourists \r\nfrom entering its premises as visitors. It effectively \r\nuses resolution 2758 (XXXVI), of 1971, as a political \r\nand humanitarian embargo on Taiwan. In our view, no \r\nsuch embargo has any place in the United Nations.\r\nThe successes of the United Nations have never \r\nbeen won by focusing on what divides us. Had we done \r\nso we would not have achieved a landmark human rights \r\ndeclaration, a transformative development agenda or a \r\nconstitution for the oceans and seas, and we certainly \r\nwould not have a framework agreement for collective \r\naction on climate change. Focusing on what unites us \r\ncan bring us further along the path towards addressing \r\nthe gaps in the law of the sea to guarantee that fairness \r\nextends even into areas beyond national jurisdiction.\r\nSimilarly, we can take a final decision in Poland \r\nto give full effect to the Paris Agreement and mobilize \r\nmomentum for the level of ambition and the magnitude \r\nof support needed to avoid irreversible adverse effects \r\nof climate change. Belize is ready to commit to raising \r\nour ambition and urges others to join us in 2020 to set \r\nthe world on the right path towards achieving the Paris \r\nAgreement goals.\r\nIn conclusion, in our humble defence of what \r\nrightly belongs to us, Belize has weathered many trials. \r\nWe see our struggle reflected in those of many others \r\nwho have been denied the full enjoyment of their rights \r\nand the full achievement of their potential. However, \r\nwe are secure in our belief that right will triumph and \r\nthat in the end, our shared values of justice and our \r\nbelief in human dignity will bring us ever closer to the \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n10/38 18-30196\r\nresolutions the world needs. We therefore march on, in \r\nservice of the United Nations and all the peoples of the \r\nworld, armed with our values and an enduring hope for \r\npeace and security.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Osman Saleh Mohammed, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the State of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Mohammed (Eritrea): Let me join previous \r\nspeakers in conveying our congratulations to the \r\nPresident for her election to lead the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-third session.\r\nEvery year, this forum provides a suitable \r\nplatform for Member States to broach critical issues of \r\ninternational peace and security and their ramifications \r\nfor national and human development. In that spirit, I \r\nwould like to draw the Assembly’s attention to key \r\nmatters of paramount importance to my country and \r\nour region as a whole.\r\nAs those present are all aware, Eritrea and Ethiopia \r\nrecently signed a historic peace agreement ending a \r\ndark two-decade chapter of war, constant tension and \r\nstrife. This historic achievement, even if it is almost \r\n16 years late, will enable both countries to funnel their \r\nresources, potential and positive energy exclusively \r\ntowards much-needed development. It has already given \r\nthe peoples of both countries hope and optimism. The \r\npositive dividend for regional peace and security that it \r\nhas generated is so clear that it does not need emphasis. \r\nIt is clearly attested to by the new frameworks of all-\r\naround cooperation that have been set in motion in the \r\npast two months or are in the offing at the regional \r\nlevel. Eritrea would like to express its gratitude to the \r\nseveral countries that contributed in various ways and \r\ndemonstrated their political goodwill in support of the \r\nsuccess of the historical process under way.\r\nLet me now turn to a perplexing injustice that has \r\naff licted my country for almost a decade. I am referring \r\nto the unwarranted sanctions that were imposed on \r\nEritrea in 2009 and 2011. With the positive winds of \r\npeace blowing in our region, several Security Council \r\nmembers are now calling for the immediate lifting of \r\nthose deplorable sanctions. However, the diplomatic \r\ndiscourse is not completely coherent. As it happens, \r\nsome countries are coming up with procedural and \r\nother pretexts and preconditions with the apparent aim \r\nof moving the goalposts and maintaining the illegal \r\nsanctions on Eritrea. As an aggrieved party that has \r\nbeen on the receiving end of a miscarriage of justice \r\nfor nine long years, Eritrea cannot and will not plead \r\nfor clemency or magnanimity. The people and the \r\nGovernment of Eritrea will continue to stand up for \r\ntheir rights until justice is achieved and the wrongs \r\ndone to them have been redressed.\r\nThe transgressions against Eritrea are in many \r\nways symptomatic of the hubris and perverse power \r\ngames that have largely governed international \r\nrelations in recent times. The spiralling crises, \r\ninstability, wars and conflicts that have raged, and \r\ncontinue to do so, in various parts of the world are the \r\ninevitable consequences of an absence of justice. They \r\nare the attendant outcomes of an international power \r\nimbalance. When the rule of law is suppressed and \r\nsupplanted by the logic of force, and when the global \r\npower balance is compromised, the inevitable outcomes \r\nare intractable crises and escalating wars.\r\nIt was against that disconcerting global backdrop \r\nthat Eritrea was first victimized and targeted by \r\nunlawful and unfair sanctions, on 23 December 2009. \r\nI will not burden the Assembly with the details of the \r\nincontrovertible facts of how and why the sanctions were \r\nimposed, since all the relevant information, including \r\nconfidential communications, WikiLeaks and all, has \r\nlong since been in the public domain and available for \r\nscrutiny. However, to sum up, the interplay of forces \r\nand factors that resulted in the sanctions was this.\r\nFirst, the principal architects of the sanctions \r\nwere United States Administrations that felt that they \r\ncould use their unassailable power and raw coercion \r\nto ram punitive measures against a small country \r\nand people through the Security Council in order \r\nto advance their misguided regional agenda. In that \r\ncontext, is worth remembering that certain officials \r\nin those Administrations had considered imposing \r\nsimilar sanctions on Eritrea in 1999 and 2000, at the \r\nheight of the border war with Ethiopia, in order to \r\nimpose asymmetrical arrangements by coercive means. \r\nThe fabricated charges peddled in 2009 were in fact \r\nimprovised attempts at implementing an overall agenda.\r\nThe second reason for the imposition of sanctions \r\nwas the inability of the United Nations system to \r\nprevent such wrongs from happening, in particular \r\nsystemic f laws and political horse-trading in the \r\noperations of the Security Council. In that context, \r\ntoo, one must remember that the Council failed to take \r\nany meaningful action against Ethiopia, despite the \r\nfact that previous Ethiopian regimes had f lagrantly \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 11/38\r\nviolated the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nAlgiers Agreement guaranteed by the same Security \r\nCouncil when they refused to abide by the final and \r\nbinding decisions of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary \r\nCommission of 13 April 2002.\r\nA third factor that drove the imposition of sanctions \r\nwas the fact that the Governments in place at that time \r\nserved the agenda of the major Powers. In the case of \r\nEritrea, the principal architects of the sanctions against \r\nit resorted to regional Trojan horses designed to mask \r\ntheir resolutions with an African face.\r\nThe sanctions imposed on Eritrea for the past nine \r\nyears have resulted in considerable economic damage to \r\nthe country and unnecessary hardships for our people. \r\nThe related smear and defamation campaigns have \r\ndone immeasurable damage to the country’s reputation \r\nand to the prospects and potential of investment. \r\nPerhaps the most significant damage is the regional \r\ninstability and insecurity that this state of affairs has \r\nbred and exacerbated. The actual costs incurred and \r\nthe opportunities forfeited, at both the national and \r\nregional levels, are therefore huge.\r\nIn the light of the widely acclaimed peace and \r\ncooperation that have been brokered in the region, the \r\nfact that certain countries are choosing to ignore the \r\nstark truth and prolong the sanctions regime in Eritrea \r\nis astounding. Over the past six decades, the Eritrean \r\npeople have waged a long and difficult struggle to \r\nadvance the cause of justice and foster a climate that \r\nis conducive to mutual security and stability in the \r\nregion. Those robust convictions and that legacy have \r\nenabled them to withstand all the wrongs and scars \r\nimposed on them by the unfair sanctions. Through their \r\ncharacteristic resilience and hard toil, they have now \r\nvanquished the injustices inflicted on them.\r\nIn conclusion, as I stressed earlier, the people of \r\nEritrea have not committed any crime or transgression \r\nthat impels them to seek clemency. As such, they are \r\nnot only calling for the immediate rescinding of the \r\nsanctions but they are also asking, and deserve, amends \r\nfor the damages incurred and opportunities forfeited.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Urbino José Gonçalves Botelho, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Communities of Sao Tome and Principe.\r\nMr. Botelho (Sao Tome and Principe) (spoke in \r\nPortuguese; English text provided by the delegation): \r\nAt the outset, let me join all those who have preceded \r\nme at this rostrum in conveying, on behalf of the \r\nGovernment and the people of Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nour sincere condolences to the Government and the \r\npeople of Indonesia, as well as the families affected \r\nby the earthquake that happened recently in that \r\nfriendly country.\r\nIt is with a great sense of honour and satisfaction \r\nthat I address the General Assembly for the first time \r\nas Minister for Foreign Affairs and Communities of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe. It \r\nis with great pleasure that I address my first words to \r\nHer Excellency Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, \r\nwhom I congratulate on her election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, \r\nand to whom I express our support for the course of \r\nher term, which we believe will be very successful. We \r\nnote that she is only the fourth woman to undertake \r\nthis noble function, and we hope that those numbers \r\nwill increase in the future in the name of the greater \r\ninclusion of women in positions of importance in \r\nthe Organization.\r\nI also congratulate the outgoing President, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, on conducting the \r\nwork of the previous session of the General Assembly \r\njudiciously, zealously and self lessly in an extremely \r\ndifficult international context.\r\nI also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute \r\nto the memory of former Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan, who passed away in August. He was a man who \r\ndedicated his life to making the world a more peaceful \r\nplace and worked tirelessly for that purpose, and always \r\nwith a great sense of our humanity. We must preserve \r\nhis legacy by continuing to strengthen our Organization \r\nas the ultimate and overall guarantor of the quest for \r\npeaceful, durable and consensus solutions, legitimized \r\nby international law, in order to achieve the desired \r\ngoals of peace, security, stability and progress for all.\r\nWe welcome the choice of the theme for this \r\nsession, “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. Our \r\nOrganization is indeed facing very complex challenges, \r\nfor which it is called to provide effective, concrete and \r\ncomprehensive responses that are truly relevant to \r\nall people.\r\nLet us emphasize the issue of migration, on which \r\nthe global leadership of the United Nations must \r\nconstantly foster dialogue among nations seeking \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n12/38 18-30196\r\nglobal solutions, promoting concerted policies to host \r\nrefugees and supporting their countries of origin to \r\nbetter address this global problem, which often has \r\ndevastating consequences for those who, in their quest \r\nfor better living conditions, are exposed to f lagrant \r\ninjustices everywhere.\r\nIf we really want peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties, our efforts must persist in search of solutions \r\nnot only to those problems but also in negotiating to \r\nmitigate the effects of the armed conflicts raging \r\nthroughout the world and to prevent the emergence \r\nand escalation of regional tensions, which can in turn \r\ngenerate others. We therefore strongly appeal from \r\nthis rostrum for ongoing dialogue aimed at peacefully \r\nresolving the tensions that we are seeing all over the \r\nplanet and the conflicts that continue to claim thousands \r\nof innocent lives, especially in Syria. We also continue \r\nto call for an understanding to be reached in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic so that negotiations can put an end \r\nto a conflict that has harmed thousands of people in a \r\ncountry where the refugee situation has led to a serious \r\nhumanitarian crisis.\r\nWe warmly commend our sister Republic of \r\nGuinea-Bissau for scheduling legislative elections for \r\nNovember and express our hope for their success, as we \r\nare certain that they will mark a new era of harmony \r\nand prosperity, along with a resumption of the regular \r\nfunctioning of its democratic institutions. We also \r\ncommend the Democratic Republic of the Congo for \r\nscheduling general elections in December and sincerely \r\nhope that they will be free, transparent and fair and held \r\nin a peaceful and harmonious environment.\r\nWe are also pleased to note the positive steps in the \r\nreconciliation process between Ethiopia and Eritrea, \r\nas well as among the warring parties in the Republic \r\nof South Sudan, and we strongly encourage them to \r\ncontinue on that path.\r\nWith regard to the situation in the Sahara, we \r\nexpress our support for the Secretary-General and his \r\nPersonal Envoy in their efforts to relaunch the political \r\nprocess on a basis of the parameters set by the Security \r\nCouncil in 2007, and we welcome the Council’s \r\nadoption of its resolution 2414 (2018), which calls for \r\nefforts to achieve a political, pragmatic, realistic and \r\nenduring solution to the dispute. We also congratulate \r\nMorocco on its serious and credible efforts to find a \r\npolitical and definitive solution to the region’s issues, \r\nand we support its initiative in favour of autonomy.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe welcomes the historic developments on the \r\nKorean peninsula and calls on all those involved to \r\ncontinue the dialogue and negotiations in the interests \r\nof all the parties concerned, with a view to achieving \r\nthe development of the entire region.\r\nWith regard to the situation in the Middle East, we \r\ncall for dialogue and a continuation of efforts to find a \r\npeaceful and negotiated solution, respecting the right \r\nof the Palestinian people to decide their own destiny, \r\nin accordance with the fundamental principles of \r\ninternational law.\r\nAlong those same lines, we renew our call for \r\ncontinued efforts to be made to normalize relations \r\nbetween the Republic of Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica so that we can see the trade embargo that has \r\nbeen an obstacle to the progress of that friendly country \r\nfor decades lifted as soon as possible.\r\nUnfortunately, we must once again express our \r\nregret that terrorist acts continue to claim so many \r\nlives around the world. We will always firmly and \r\nvehemently condemn such heinous acts, which show \r\nno respect for human life, will always earn our firmest \r\nand most vehement condemnation. We also want to take \r\nthis opportunity to condemn once again the terrorist \r\nacts of Boko Haram on the territory of our neighbour \r\nand brother the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Their \r\nharmful consequences continue to undermine the \r\ndevelopment and security of the entire Gulf of Guinea \r\nregion. Likewise, we strongly condemn the terrorist \r\nacts that have caused so much suffering to the martyred \r\npeoples of the Sahel region, and in particular those of \r\nMali, the Niger and Burkina Faso. We reaffirm the \r\nstrong commitment of the Democratic Republic of \r\nSao Tome and Principe to actively collaborating with \r\nits regional and international partners in all initiatives \r\naimed at eradicating this problem from our societies. \r\nOnly by acting together can we truly build peaceful, \r\nequitable and sustainable societies, as the theme of this \r\nsession suggests.\r\nThe leadership role of our Organization undoubtedly \r\ngoes hand in hand with actions that bring together \r\nefforts to combat climate change. We are confronted \r\nevery day with the devastating effects of climate change \r\naround the world. Natural disasters are occurring on an \r\nincreasingly broad scale and with growing intensity, \r\nleading to loss of life, especially in the least developed \r\nregions of the world. Global efforts must continue \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 13/38\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, and they must be a \r\nshared responsibility for everyone, because it is up to \r\nall of us to safeguard the future for coming generations.\r\nAt the beginning of my statement, I alluded to the \r\nmost recent tragic example of the effects of climate \r\nchange in Indonesia. It is therefore urgent to implement \r\nthe provisions of the Paris Agreement, so that the \r\nnecessary technical, financial and human resources are \r\nproperly directed towards the immensity of the task at \r\nhand. We therefore hope that the forthcoming twenty-\r\nforth session of the Conference of the Parties, to be \r\nheld in Katowice, Poland, will be very successful and \r\nthat the dialogue there will in fact make it possible to \r\nimplement the Agreement. Sao Tome and Principe will \r\ndo everything in its power to advocate for the crucial \r\nimportance of shared and universal efforts to adopt the \r\nnecessary policies in that regard.\r\nWe also want to underline our support for the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), whose \r\nachievement will truly benefit the whole world. \r\nThe support of all the specialized agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations will be required for formulating and \r\nimplementing the policies necessary for the achievement \r\nof the SDGs. Sao Tome and Principe would like to point \r\nout that we have been putting this type of collaboration \r\ninto practice in our country.\r\nWe also want to highlight and welcome the \r\ncontinued efforts of the African Union to implement \r\nits inclusive Agenda 2063, whose achievement, we \r\nbelieve, will enable African countries to throw off \r\nthe chains of poverty, thereby bringing their peoples a \r\nbetter future. The spirit that has guided us this far must \r\ncontinue to be strengthened, taking into account our \r\nparticular specificities and constantly keeping in mind \r\nwhat unites us, which is the quest for the well-being and \r\ndevelopment of the whole of Africa.\r\nSao Tome and Principe, a small developing island \r\nState, with all the constraints that this condition \r\nentails, is pursuing a policy adapted to its realities \r\nwhile maintaining respect for its multicultural diversity \r\nand human rights. With an economy that is very \r\nvulnerable to external shocks, the current Government \r\nhas designed and is working to achieve an ambitious \r\ntransformation agenda by 2030, closely following the \r\nguidelines of both the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand the African Union’s Agenda 2063.\r\nIt has been a difficult task, but we would like to \r\nput on record the support that we have received from \r\norganizations that have closely collaborated with the \r\nGovernment and our important bilateral partners, \r\nwhose support the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe sincerely acknowledges. Since our task \r\nis still ongoing, we would very much appreciate being \r\nable to continue to count on those contributions.\r\nOn 7 October, Sao Tome and Principe will hold \r\nlegislative, local and regional elections. We invite the \r\ninternational community as independent observers to \r\njoin us once again in witnessing the strength, quality \r\nand maturity of our democracy, which the elections \r\nwill further consolidate.\r\nThe United Nations must assume its role as a \r\nleader in the global efforts to bring development to all \r\npeoples, in the unceasing pursuit of peaceful solutions \r\nto the ongiong conflicts in the world, in combating \r\nclimate change, reducing inequalities, promoting \r\ngender equality and equity, fighting the scourge of \r\nterrorism and hatred based on race, sexual orientation \r\nand religious beliefs, promoting intercultural dialogue \r\namong peoples, and in the uncompromising defence of \r\npeace and human rights. These values, which we are \r\ncertain we all share, must be continually upheld, and \r\nall our efforts must be conducive to their protection and \r\nreinforcement in a spirit of frank and open dialogue \r\nthat benefits all.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe also maintains and reaffirms its unequivocal \r\ncommitment to the ideals of peace and fraternity among \r\npeoples, and will always strive for close collaboration \r\nin our efforts to identify shared responsibilities and \r\nfind common solutions to our common problems, with \r\na view to building more prosperous, peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies, pursuant to the ideals of \r\nthe Organization.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Sidiki Kaba, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nSenegalese Living Abroad of the Republic of Senegal,\r\nMr. Kaba (Senegal) (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof His Excellency Mr. Macky Sall, the President \r\nof the Republic of Senegal, and his Government, I \r\nwould like to express my warm congratulations to the \r\nPresident on her election to lead the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-third session. Beyond Member States’ \r\njudicious choice of her and her country, Ecuador, it \r\nis all women of the world who are honoured. I would \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n14/38 18-30196\r\nlike to convey Senegal’s sustained tribute to them for \r\ntheir invaluable contributions and tireless fight for the \r\nwell-being of humankind. I would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to commend the work of her predecessor, \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák.\r\nI wish Secretary-General António Guterres every \r\nsuccess in the reforms he is undertaking to give our \r\nOrganization the means to better meet the new demands \r\nfor momentum and efficiency of our times. I believe it \r\nis that ongoing concern to reform the United Nations \r\nand devote more tools and resources to it in order to \r\nrespond to the legitimate expectations and aspirations \r\nof peoples that represents the interests and the high \r\nimpact of the theme of this session, entitled “Making the \r\nUnited Nations relevant to all people: global leadership \r\nand shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies”.\r\nThat current and relevant theme gives us an \r\nopportunity to assess our collective action in the light \r\nof the noble ideals of peace, security, stability, respect \r\nfor human rights and sustainable prosperity, nourished \r\nby the founding fathers of the United Nations, in order \r\nto better understand the various challenges of our times \r\nin a troubled world undergoing profound change. These \r\nglobal challenges, including terrorism, extremist, \r\nxenophobic and racist abuses, poverty, migration, \r\nglobal warming and market regulation, require that \r\nwe find comprehensive and inclusive solutions to them \r\nthrough multilateralism.\r\nBy its very nature, the United Nations is the seat \r\nand embodiment of that multilateralism. It remains \r\nthe only forum where concerted solutions of universal \r\nscope can be conceived and developed. In addition, \r\nout of fidelity to the historic and current calling of \r\nthe United Nations, it is more than ever incumbent on \r\nus to deepen our anchor in multilateralism in order to \r\nirreversibly establish the ideal of a better world where \r\nhuman beings remain at the heart of our concerns.\r\nThe world today is marked by growing pessimism \r\nabout the effectiveness of the United Nations, which is \r\nsometimes rightly or wrongly accused of abandoning its \r\ntask and being unable to provide adequate responses to \r\nour peoples’ problems and the acute crises that seriously \r\nthreaten our planet and life on earth. In that context, it \r\nis up to us to prove, if it is still necessary to do so, \r\nthat the United Nations remains an essential platform \r\nin the conduct of world affairs. Its failure is everyone’s \r\nfailure, but its success is also everyone’s success.\r\nTo improve the effectiveness of the Organization, we \r\nmust overcome our ideological and political differences \r\nwith a view to building a stronger United Nations, which \r\nwill guarantee the effectiveness of multilateralism and \r\namong other things enable it to promote human rights, \r\nsustainable development and the advent of a world free \r\nof fear and poverty, an ideal that remains humankind’s \r\nhighest aspiration. The achievement of sustainable \r\ndevelopment in its triple dimensions — economic, social \r\nand environmental — should also guide our collective \r\nactions. That shared goal should continue to drive us \r\nforward, so that we can honour the commitments we \r\nmade in September 2015 to implementing the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nIt is equally important to conclude the Doha \r\nRound of negotiations and agree on fair, democratic \r\nand sustainable trade rules, taking into account the \r\ninterests of developing countries, particularly in Africa. \r\nMutually beneficial trade that protects investment, \r\npays a fair price for raw materials and generates \r\nshared prosperity is more important than ever. We also \r\nneed an instrument to stop the tax evasion and illicit \r\nfinancial f lows that undermine the African continent’s \r\ndevelopment efforts.\r\nFurthermore, we must come to an agreement on \r\nissues related to climate change. In this regard, I would \r\nlike to reiterate my country’s support for the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change, to which it remains \r\ncommitted, as well as to the fight against desertification \r\nand coastal erosion, in particular. As an African and \r\ncoastal country that is particularly vulnerable to \r\nclimate change, Senegal reiterates its call for increasing \r\nthe endowment of the Green Climate Fund, with a \r\nview to giving States such as ours, which contribute \r\nless pollution and are more exposed to climate change, \r\nthe opportunity to undertake appropriate adaptation \r\nand mitigation measures. Similarly, it would be to \r\nthe public good to agree on environmental issues and \r\nwork to strengthen the international legal framework in \r\nthat area through the adoption of a global pact for the \r\nenvironment. The same spirit of consensus should also \r\nprevail in such matters as financing for development, \r\ndisarmament and the fight against terrorism.\r\nTo make the Organization more fit for purpose, we \r\nmust complete the reform processes under way so that \r\nit can adapt to the new global political configurations \r\nand challenges of this world, which is totally different \r\nfrom the one into which the United Nations was born. \r\nThat is why in particular we should show greater \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 15/38\r\npolitical will on finally agreeing on Security Council \r\nreform by correcting the historical injustice suffered \r\nby Africa, which remains the only continent without a \r\npermanent seat on the Council.\r\nWith that same determination, we should also work \r\nharder to realize the right of the Palestinian people to a \r\nviable State with East Jerusalem as its capital, coexisting \r\nin peace with the State of Israel, within secure and \r\ninternationally recognized and guaranteed borders.\r\nFurthermore, we believe that the adoption of \r\na global compact on migration that addresses the \r\nopportunities and challenges in that area is crucial and \r\nwould be beneficial for a migratory population that is \r\nestimated at 3 per cent of the world’s population, or \r\nmore than 200 million people. In short, United Nations \r\naction should be reoriented and its power strengthened \r\non a global scale, or we will never be able to achieve \r\nthe ideals of peace, prosperity, social justice and \r\nfriendship among peoples enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nFor a United Nations that is close to the people \r\nand that serves our nations, we must successfully meet \r\nthe challenge of providing sustainable development. \r\nIn that regard, I want to echo the appeal made by the \r\ninternational community when it met in February in \r\nDakar for the Global Partnership for Education. Senegal \r\nhopes that the pledges made on that occasion to mobilize \r\n$3.1 billion for the strategic sector of education will \r\nbe honoured so that we can lift thousands of children, \r\nespecially girls, out of the darkness of ignorance and \r\ninto the light of knowledge.\r\nMy country accords great priority to improving the \r\nsituation of women and young people. That is why we \r\nare implementing bold social programmes within the \r\nframework of our plan for an emerging Senegal by 2035, \r\nso as to ensure their empowerment and responsibility.\r\nMy country also remains committed to the \r\nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs), particularly SDG 6, on water. In that regard, I \r\nwould like to remind the Assembly that in 2021 Senegal \r\nwill host the ninth World Water Forum. Senegal has \r\nalso been chosen to lead UNESCO’s International \r\nHydrological Programme and to chair the Organization \r\nfor the Development of the Senegal River, which remains \r\na model worldwide and is recognized as an excellent \r\nexample of peaceful cross-border water management.\r\nSenegal was honoured by President Macky Sall’s \r\nappointment to be a prominent member of the High-\r\nlevel Panel on Water, which was set up jointly by \r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations and the \r\nPresident of the World Bank and whose theme will be \r\n“Water, Peace, Security”. That theme was included \r\non the agenda of the Security Council for the first \r\ntime during Senegal’s presidency of the Council in \r\nNovember 2016.I would therefore like to reiterate our \r\ngratitude for the confidence that has been placed in \r\nSenegal within those frameworks, and to solicit the \r\nsupport of all for the success of the ninth World Water \r\nForum. I am also pleased to note that Dakar will host \r\nthe third iteration of the International Conference on \r\nthe Emergence of Africa, on 17 and 18 January 2019. \r\nIt will be a great opportunity to outline innovative \r\neconomic and social development programmes.\r\nIt is also an appropriate time to commend the \r\nsuccessful partnership model between Senegal and the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, especially \r\nin the implementation of the emergency community \r\ndevelopment programme, launched by President Macky \r\nSall, which, in accordance with the principle of leaving \r\nno one behind, will make it possible to transform  our \r\nrural populations’ living conditions. Senegal is willing \r\nto share its experience in that area.\r\nI would like to inform members of Senegal’s wish to \r\nrun for the presidency of the Human Rights Council in \r\n2019. We have already obtained the endorsement of the \r\nAfrican Union and are counting on the valuable support \r\nof those here to help our candidacy for that important \r\npost. I am also pleased to invite members to the fifth \r\niteration of the Dakar International Forum on Peace \r\nand Security in Africa, to be held on 5 and 6 November \r\non the theme of “Peace and security in Africa: the \r\nchallenges of sustainable stability and development”. I \r\nwould like to ask everyone to participate in order to \r\nmake that major event a success.\r\nIn conclusion, let us remember that at its founding, \r\nthe United Nations symbolized humankind’s most \r\nfervent hopes. Today it embodies them more than ever. \r\nIt remains the only global institution whose legitimacy \r\nand competence derive from its universal composition \r\nand its mandate covering the three fundamental pillars \r\nof international peace and security, development and \r\nhuman rights. To take the full measure of our historical \r\nresponsibilities and the hopes placed in the United \r\nNations is therefore to make it an Organization at the \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n16/38 18-30196\r\nexclusive service of Member States, their populations \r\nand humankind in all its diversity.\r\nI would therefore like to share the heartfelt cry of \r\nthe late former Secretary-General Kofi Annan — peace \r\nbe with him — to whom I want to pay a sincere tribute. \r\nHe said,\r\n“But let us not forget why the United Nations \r\nmatters. It matters only to the extent that it can \r\nmake a useful contribution to solving the problems \r\nand accomplishing the tasks I have just outlined ... \r\nIf we lose sight of that point, the United Nations \r\nwill have little or no role to play in the twenty-first \r\ncentury.” (A/54/PV.94, pp. 3-4)\r\nI therefore urge the international community to \r\ncontinue its efforts to ensure the effective realization \r\nof our shared ideal of a better world for all, so that that \r\nterrible but lucid warning of the possible uselessness \r\nof our Organization does not become a cruel and \r\ndestructive reality, frustrating humankind’s most \r\nbeautiful hope.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Kalla Ankourao, Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nCooperation, African Integration and Nigeriens Living \r\nAbroad of the Republic of the Niger.\r\nMr. Ankourao (Niger) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I would like to congratulate the President on her \r\nelection to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session. I would also like to extend my sincere \r\ngreetings to everyone here, as well as to congratulate \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák and his team on \r\ntheir excellent work during the previous session.\r\nI would like to express my country’s gratitude \r\nto Secretary-General António Guterres for his \r\ncommitment to serving the United Nations, and to \r\nreaffirm the Niger’s support for the continuation of the \r\nreforms he has courageously undertaken to adapt our \r\nshared Organization to the demands and challenges \r\nof modern times. The challenges, as we all know, are \r\ncertainly enormous. But thanks to his determination \r\nand his excellent team, we believe that we will be able \r\nto achieve the expected results. In that regard, I would \r\nlike to assure him of my delegation’s full support.\r\nBy giving this session the theme “Making the \r\nUnited Nations relevant to all people: global leadership \r\nand shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies”, we have been both provided with \r\na timely reminder of the profound motives that led to the \r\ncreation of the United Nations and called on to renew \r\nour confidence in it. My delegation can therefore only \r\nwelcome that appropriate choice of theme in a world \r\nfacing multiple challenges, such as terrorism, violent \r\nextremism, climate change, migration and poverty, \r\nall of which require greater international cooperation \r\nand responsible engagement on the part of all of us. In \r\nthat regard, the Niger believes that the United Nations \r\nremains a valuable and irreplaceable organization, not \r\nonly for promoting international peace and security \r\nbut also for responding effectively to the various \r\nchallenges facing our States. In other words, my \r\ncountry prioritizes multilateralism and the unifying \r\nrole of the United Nations. Our combined efforts and \r\nresources for reaching common solutions remain the \r\nbest alternative in our efforts to ensure peace, security \r\nand the harmonious development for humankind.\r\nConcerning the issue of migration, the Niger \r\nwelcomes the finalization of the draft text of the global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration, the \r\nfirst-ever international agreement initiated by the \r\nUnited Nations on managing migration. Combating \r\nirregular migration and other shameful practices \r\nsuch as the illegal smuggling of migrants and human \r\ntrafficking has been the focus of many international \r\nmeetings in recent years. During those meetings, many \r\ncommitments were made to eradicating those scourges. \r\nIn 2016, in order to implement those commitments, the \r\nNiger outlined and implemented an operational doctrine \r\nbased on balanced legislation and commensurate \r\nregulatory measures, which have enabled us to deliver \r\nconcrete results. For example, between October 2016 \r\nand January of this year we reduced by 90 per cent the \r\nmonthly total of potential migrants entering the city of \r\nAgadez, the main point of entry and exit for migrants in \r\nthe Niger. In 2017, 268 traffickers were referred to the \r\ncourts, and 140 of their vehicles were impounded. Those \r\nresults, which have been unanimously acknowledged \r\nand commended by the international community, are \r\nthe product of the commitment and political will of \r\nPresident Mahamadou Issoufou to combating irregular \r\nmigration and trafficking in persons and helping to \r\neradicate the inhuman and degrading treatment of \r\nmigrants beyond Agadez.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to welcome \r\nthe cooperation between the Niger and the United \r\nNations through the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees and the International \r\nOrganization for Migration, which contribute \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 17/38\r\nsignificantly to managing migration f lows in my \r\ncountry. The Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt \r\nthe Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular \r\nMigration, to be held in Marrakech in December, will \r\nresult in the adoption of the global compact and will \r\ncertainly be a defining moment. The Niger, as a perfect \r\nexample of a transit country, will attend the Conference \r\nin Marrakech in order to support the initiative as a \r\nstarting point for structured international cooperation \r\non migration.\r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals remain \r\none of the major preoccupations of the international \r\ncommunity in general, and of developing countries \r\nin particular. Three years after their adoption, my \r\ncountry has just presented its first voluntary national \r\nreview of its implementation of the Goals at the High-\r\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development held \r\nhere in New York in July. The Forum, under the theme \r\n“Transformation towards sustainable and resilient \r\nsocieties”, provided the Niger with an opportunity \r\nto share with other members of the international \r\ncommunity our progress, especially in the areas of \r\nenergy access, education and health services, as well \r\nas security. In pursuing development, my country has \r\nadopted a 2035 strategy for sustainable development \r\nand inclusive growth, incorporated into its 2017-\r\n2021 economic and social development plan, which \r\nconstitutes the national framework for implementing \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The \r\nstrategy is also linked to the African Union’s Agenda \r\n2063 for the development of the continent, one of the \r\nkey implementation instruments of which is the African \r\nFree Continental Trade Area, adopted in Rwanda in \r\nMarch at the tenth extraordinary summit of the African \r\nUnion, convened for that purpose.\r\nThe Free Trade Area is aimed specifically at \r\novercoming dependence on commodity exports and \r\nat promoting social and economic transformation so \r\nas to achieve inclusive growth, industrialization and \r\nsustainable development throughout the continent. \r\nConsiderable efforts to mobilize domestic resources are \r\nbeing pursued diligently in line with the spirit of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis \r\nAbaba Action Agenda on Financing for Development. It \r\nis nonetheless clear that many challenges remain and \r\nmust be overcome if we are to meet the goals of those \r\nvarious programmes. Hence the need for the effective \r\nimplementation of a more proactive and equitable \r\nglobal partnership in accordance with the commitments \r\nmade by developed countries with regard to official \r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nIn addition, as a country of the Sahel with two \r\nthirds of its land area in the desert, the Niger is being hit \r\nhard by the effects of climate change, whose economic \r\nconsequences are on the verge of making people’s lives \r\nintolerable. The 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange represents a unique opportunity to save our \r\nplanet. The Niger has taken pride in implementing \r\nthe measures set out in the Agreement’s road map. \r\nAccordingly, in November, at President Mahamadou \r\nIssoufou’s initiative as Chair of the Sahel climate \r\ncommission, my country will host a round table for \r\ntechnical and financial partners to identify guidelines \r\nfor the implementation of the Sahel region climate \r\ninvestment plan. I therefore call on the international \r\ncommunity, as well as our various partners, to \r\nparticipate in that endeavour. Financing the plan will \r\nenable the Sahel countries to manage the impact of \r\nclimate change on populations and ecosystems more \r\neffectively.\r\nThe demographic challenge is another priority area \r\nfor my country, which is dealing with a population \r\ngrowth rate of 4.2 per cent, the highest in the world, \r\naccording to our 2012 general census of the population. \r\nAware of the impasse that the country could face if \r\nnothing is done to reduce that rate, the Government \r\nhas redoubled its efforts by engaging the people and \r\ntheir traditional and religious leaders and partners in \r\na significant effort to reverse the trend. Since then we \r\nhave noted a drop in the overall national average birth \r\nrate from 7.6 children per woman in 2012 to 6 per woman \r\nin 2017. If that trend continues, within several years \r\nwe hope to achieve manageable population growth in \r\nrelation to our gross national product. For that we need \r\nthe robust support of the international community. At \r\nthe same time, the Government will pursue efforts to \r\nenrol girls in school and ensure that they stay in school \r\nup to the compulsory age of 16, as the two problems are \r\nclosely linked.\r\nI mentioned earlier the major challenges facing \r\nthe Sahel region in general and the Niger in particular. \r\nThey involve terrorism, cross-border crime, extreme \r\npoverty and climate and environmental shocks, all \r\nof which have disrupted our agro-pastoral economy \r\nand increased the vulnerability of the peoples of the \r\nSahel. In order to tackle our security challenges, the \r\nHeads of State and Government of the region have \r\ntaken initiatives, including by pooling their resources \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n18/38 18-30196\r\nthrough the establishment of the Multinational Joint \r\nTask Force of the Lake Chad basin countries and of \r\nthe Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 \r\nSahel), in order to mitigate the Malian crisis and its \r\nspillover into neighbouring countries.\r\nWith regard to the situation in the Lake Chad \r\nbasin region, the 2014 deployment of the Multinational \r\nJoint Force made up of troops from Cameroon, Chad, \r\nNigeria and the Niger has enabled us to weaken the \r\noperational capacity of the terrorist group Boko \r\nHaram, thereby contributing to the gradual return of \r\npeace and stability to the subregion. The challenge \r\nfacing the region today is therefore becoming markedly \r\nmore socioeconomic rather than security-related. It \r\nis now a matter of gradually ensuring the welfare of \r\na population reeling from the disasters created by the \r\nyears of violent conflict that have resulted in hundreds \r\nof thousands of refugees and displaced persons. It is \r\nalso a matter of rebuilding the region’s economy, while \r\nprioritizing youth employment and rebuilding the Lake \r\nChad region. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nthank all partners currently involved in dealing with \r\nthe humanitarian consequences of that conflict.\r\nWithin the framework of the G-5 Sahel, the \r\nJoint Force for that region was established in 2017 to \r\ncombat terrorism and cross-border crime within the \r\nfive member countries more effectively, as well as to \r\nsecure the region and thereby create the conditions \r\nnecessary for implementing development programmes. \r\nThe process of making the Joint Force operational has \r\nnot been as rapid as the countries concerned would \r\nhave liked. However, with the impetus provided by the \r\nAfrican Heads of State and Government at the thirty-\r\nfirst African Union Summit in Nouakchott in July, \r\nthe process seems to be gaining momentum. The four \r\noperations undertaken with the support of Operation \r\nBarkhane, led by France, have been successful. The \r\nJoint Force’s primary concern involves obtaining, in a \r\nsustainable way, the resources needed to carry out its \r\nwork. The international high-level conference on the \r\nSahel held in Brussels in February made it possible \r\nto secure the financing required for the first year. We \r\nwelcome that accomplishment, thank those partners \r\nthat pledged to support our efforts financially, and \r\nurgently appeal for the completion of the process \r\nneeded to make the pledged funds available. Beyond the \r\nfirst year’s scope of work, however, the outlook is not \r\nreassuring with regard to ensuring that the Joint Force \r\nhas the necessary funding to complete its mission. In \r\norder to ensure sustained funding and resources for it, \r\nwe continue to believe that the best-advised solution \r\nwould be to give it a mandate under Chapter VII of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. It is a matter of peace \r\nand security in the region, and even the world. We \r\nfind it difficult to understand the hesitation shown by \r\ncertain countries when faced with the obvious.\r\nThe challenges facing us are not only security-\r\nrelated. They are above all economic. The Sahel \r\nneeds meaningful investments for its development. \r\nWe welcome the ubiquitous initiatives to that end, \r\nincluding those of the United Nations, the African \r\nUnion, the European Union and other bilateral \r\npartners, but we must act fast in coordinating their \r\nimplementation. The upcoming meeting in Nouakchott \r\non 6 December dedicated to the G-5 Sahel priority \r\ninvestment programme will be a major test for efforts \r\nto deal resolutely with the issue of development, which, \r\nin my opinion, is the best defence against terrorism.\r\nConcerning other conflicts in Africa, my country \r\nwelcomes the de-escalation in the Horn of Africa over \r\nthe past three months and the peace agreement signed \r\nby the warring parties in South Sudan. Those are two \r\npieces of good news, and we can only be grateful for \r\nthe wisdom that led to them. With regard to the Middle \r\nEast, our meeting here is taking place in an environment \r\nin which international solidarity with the Palestinian \r\ncause is undergoing a noticeable decline in terms of \r\npolitical and financial support, resulting in budget \r\ncuts and the recognition of Al-Quds Al-Sharif as the \r\ncapital of Israel by certain members of the international \r\ncommunity. The Niger reaffirms its support for the \r\naspirations of the Palestinian people to realize their \r\nright to establish their own independent and sovereign \r\nState within the June 1967 borders and with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital. With regard to Yemen, we \r\nexpress our commitment to that country’s sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity. The Niger rejects all forms of \r\ninterference in its internal affairs and supports it in \r\nits search for a peaceful solution to the current bloody \r\nconflict and efforts to achieve comprehensive and \r\nharmonious development.\r\nSince the 2005 World Summit, we at the United \r\nNations have been working on comprehensive reform \r\nof the United Nations system, aimed at enabling the \r\nOrganization to play its unifying and leading role in \r\nrealizing solidarity and friendship among peoples. In \r\nour view, the new global partnership for development \r\nmust mean a decrease in intra- and inter-State \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 19/38\r\ninequalities and the collaboration of every State — large \r\nor small, rich or poor — in the decision-making process \r\nin overseeing world affairs. That is how we will ensure \r\nbalanced governance at the United Nations. With regard \r\nto reform of the Security Council, the Niger remains \r\ncommitted to the African Common Position eshrined \r\nin the Ezulwini Consensus. We strongly encourage \r\nMember States to step up that process and demonstrate \r\ngreater resolve in their efforts to adapt the Security \r\nCouncil to the realities of today’s world.\r\nIn conclusion, on behalf of peacekeeping \r\noperations, I stress the fact that new forms of conflict, \r\nparticularly asymmetrical wars, impose demands on us \r\nto which we would like to see a response in the form of \r\na radical transformation of the current United Nations \r\npeacekeeping system. That will require strengthening \r\ncooperation among the United Nations, regional \r\norganizations and the troop-contributing countries and \r\nproviding missions with conflict-specific mandates.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Francine Baron, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nCaribbean Community Affairs of the Commonwealth \r\nof Dominica.\r\nMs. Baron (Dominica): I congratulate the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly on her election to the \r\npresidency, and my delegation wishes her every success \r\nin a productive tenure as we seek to direct the affairs of \r\nthis important institution in the interests of humankind.\r\nI would like to express my condolences to the \r\npeople of Indonesia, who are struggling to cope with \r\nthe effects of the tsunami that struck them yesterday. \r\nWe know all too well how challenging this time must be \r\nfor them, and we off them our solidarity.\r\nThere are few moments in the history of a nation \r\nthat capture the resilience, fortitude and strength of \r\nits people. For us that moment came on 18 September \r\n2017, when Hurricane Maria unleashed its fury of \r\n180-mile-per-hour winds on us, bringing Dominica \r\nto its knees. Immediately after the raging winds and \r\ntorrential downpours subsided, our people raised their \r\nbattered and wounded selves and began the daunting \r\ntask of search-and-rescue and clearing roadways, and \r\nthereafter quickly moved into rebuilding mode.\r\nI am proud to stand here, one year later, representing \r\na people who have fought against adversity since that \r\nday to attain some form of normalcy in their lives. I \r\nam proud to be representing students who spent months \r\naway from classrooms and endured the inconvenience \r\nof no electricity, no Internet and the disruption of \r\nliving in shelters, but who attained some of the \r\nhighest scores on the recently concluded Caribbean \r\nsecondary-school examinations. I am proud to stand \r\nhere representing the farmers who have gone back to \r\ntheir fields and are now harvesting fresh produce to \r\nfeed our people and to export. I applaud Dominicans \r\nfar and wide for being part of the relief efforts and the \r\nrebuilding process, but I salute in particular those at \r\nhome who have walked for miles every day up, down \r\nand across the island to be of service, and worked \r\ncountless hours to save lives, provide essential services \r\nand deliver vital supplies to those in need. Hurricane \r\nMaria wreaked havoc on Dominica, but the world must \r\nbe told of the strength of Dominicans, our tenacity and \r\nour determination as a people.\r\nThe efforts of our people were keenly matched \r\nby the outpouring of support that we received from \r\nmembers of the United Nations family — from our \r\nbrothers and sisters in the Caribbean region to our \r\ninternational partners and friends, ordinary men and \r\nwomen across the globe reached out to us to lend a \r\nhelping hand. As we speak, scores of volunteers are \r\non the ground helping with the rebuilding efforts. We \r\nhave also received tremendous support from regional \r\nresponse agencies and international organizations, both \r\nwithin and outside the United Nations system, and from \r\ninstitutions such as the World Bank. All of their efforts \r\nhave contributed significantly to the progress that we \r\nhave made thus far. We cannot on this occasion single \r\nout those many persons, countries and organizations \r\nthat have reached out to us, but the people of Dominica \r\nare eternally grateful to all of them for standing with us \r\nin our darkest hour. I thank them all.\r\nA few days after the passage of Hurricane Maria, \r\nPrime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit of Dominica stood \r\nbefore this body and sounded a call for action (see A/72/\r\nPV.19). He called for the world to wake up and take note \r\nthat the war of climate change had come to our shores. \r\nHe sent out a call to all countries — big and small, \r\ndeveloped and developing — to come together to save \r\nour planet. One year later, what have we done? Where \r\nare we? What have we achieved? Among and around us \r\nare many who continue to deny the reality of climate \r\nchange. We have not, as a global community, agreed \r\non a plan for the implementation of the commitments \r\nmade at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n20/38 18-30196\r\nChange in Paris. Nor have we mobilized the resources \r\nto capitalize the $100 billion dollars per year pledged to \r\nassist the most vulnerable and to adapt to and mitigate \r\nthe harmful effects of climate change. While we have \r\nbeen failing to live up to those commitments, Arctic \r\nice shelves have continued to melt at an alarming rate, \r\nthe oceans continue to get warmer, hurricanes and \r\nstorms continue to develop and threaten our countries, \r\nand droughts are becoming more severe and f looding \r\nmore pronounced. Climate change is therefore the \r\nglobal responsibility of our time. I do not even for a \r\nbrief moment say that lightly. How could I say anything \r\nlightly, standing here in this forum that appeals to our \r\nuniversal humanity?\r\nWe live in a world in which too many children go \r\nhungry night after night; light arms and small weapons \r\ncontinue to infiltrate our most vulnerable societies; \r\nand non-communicable diseases account for many \r\npreventable deaths. Yes, I agree that poverty, inequality \r\nand violence are shared responsibilities too, but their \r\nmodern-day manifestations are wrapped up in climate \r\nchange. Climate change arises from activities that \r\nsupport and reflect inequalities, and it is always the \r\npoor who suffer the most. It is the poor whose lands are \r\nimpacted by severe droughts and f looding and whose \r\nhomes are destroyed and whose loved ones perish. It \r\nis the poor who have the least capacity to escape the \r\nheavy burdens of poverty, disease and death.\r\nMuch violence f lows directly from the climate \r\nchange-induced scarcity of things like water and \r\nproductive lands. Climate change is the main symptom \r\nof our world’s broken economy, society and humanity. \r\nThose are precisely the issues for which the United \r\nNations was created. Let this not be just another \r\nmoment to simply sharpen the rhetoric or to speak \r\nmerely of redoubling current efforts. We have done \r\nthat too many times before, and have nevertheless \r\nwatched climate change continue its ravages. While we \r\npontificate and engage in a perpetual debate, climate \r\nchange will march on, laying waste to our forests \r\nand fields, whipping up the fury of angry winds and \r\npunishing rains and wrecking lives and livelihoods. \r\nIt is no secret that some countries’ lack of motivation \r\nto take the necessary action is rooted in the economic \r\ntruth that those who gain most from the activities that \r\ncreate climate change remain the most removed from \r\nits dire consequences. Since climate change is the \r\nresult of an economic calculus that will keep pushing \r\nglobal destruction further and further along, it must be \r\naccepted as the responsibility of our time, one we must \r\nput our collective efforts behind to arrest.\r\nIt was only after Prime Minister Skeritt left this \r\nHall last year that international experts completed the \r\npost-disaster needs assessment for Dominica. Their \r\nconclusions disclosed that a single hurricane had in a \r\nfew hours caused loss and damage equivalent to 226 per \r\ncent of our country’s gross domestic product (GDP). A \r\nmere two years earlier, a tropical storm had wiped out \r\nthe equivalent of 90 per cent of our GDP. The cost of \r\nrebuilding a better and more resilient nation comes with \r\na price tag far in excess of what small developing States \r\nlike Dominica are able to meet single-handedly. That is \r\nexacerbated by the debilitating impact that those events \r\nhave on economic activities. It deprives the country \r\nof much-needed revenue at a critical time. As I speak \r\nbefore the Assembly at this very moment, dangerous \r\nstorms are gathering in the Western Atlantic. As climate \r\nchange warms the oceans and feeds the rainstorms, \r\nthe risk of future loss and damage increases. Yet the \r\nprice of the production and consumption of goods \r\nthat contribute to climate change has not been set to \r\ncompensate us for our losses and damages resulting \r\nfrom that change.\r\nFrom the perspective of our shared destiny, those \r\ngoods are being over-produced and over-consumed. \r\nClimate change is not a freak of nature. It is as man-\r\nmade as power and greed. The “polluter pays” principle \r\nis an accepted principle — a golden nexus of morality, \r\neconomics and environmental policy. The “polluter \r\npays” principle is being tried and tested at the national \r\nlevel, but at the international level, alas, it is the \r\nvictim who pays. Let us consider the insurance model \r\nchampioned by many industrialized countries and \r\ninternational agencies as the solution to climate change. \r\nIsland States on the front line are being asked to take out \r\nadditional insurance against the losses and damage that \r\nare the direct results of a change in climate caused by \r\nothers. That is asking the victim to pay by instalment. \r\nThe insane equivalent would be for the arsonist to tell a \r\nhouse-owner to take out fire insurance instead of trying \r\nto stop him setting fire to the house. If our principal \r\nresponse to man-made climate change is to make it \r\neasier for the victims to foot the bill, then the march of \r\nclimate change will press on unimpeded. It is therefore \r\nuntenable, indefensible and downright unacceptable.\r\nThe game-changer would be to establish a different \r\nkind of insurance that pays out quickly to the victims \r\nof climate disasters, especially for vulnerable and at-\r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 21/38\r\nrisk countries like ours. Fairness requires that that \r\ninsurance mechanism must be funded by those that \r\nhave contributed most to climate change. Additionally, \r\nit needs to be scaled up as a matter of urgency. The \r\nCaribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility paid out \r\nfunds for the immediate relief efforts, but it does not \r\nhave the capacity to insure against loss and damage. \r\nToday I want to propose that the United Nations oversee \r\na climate loss-and-damage insurance fund, whereby \r\npremiums are paid by those who have contributed \r\nmost and continue to contribute to climate change, \r\nand whereby payouts go quickly to those who suffer \r\nthe direct consequences of climate disasters, once they \r\nhave been independently declared as such.\r\nEnding the inequality that separates those who \r\ngain and those who lose would remove the fuel lines \r\nof climate change. That is what the international \r\ncommunity must do, if it is serious about halting \r\nclimate change. We urge the Assembly to do that, and \r\nwe hope its feet are swift because we can no longer \r\nafford to wait. Our people needed sanctuary and safety \r\nyesterday, not tomorrow. In the past 12 months, while \r\ncontending with the sheer hard task of relief and early \r\nrecovery efforts, housing the vulnerable and restoring \r\nessential services, Dominica has instituted a plan to \r\nmake it the first climate-resilient nation in the world. \r\nWe have drafted legislation to establish the Climate \r\nResilience Execution Agency of Dominica, which will \r\ndeliver the projects that will achieve that goal. We \r\nhave recruited its leadership and identified $1 billion \r\nworth of critical projects to complement the plan. We \r\nhave rolled up our sleeves and started work. Our plan \r\nis based on designing extremely resilient networks, \r\nwaterproofing our economy and building resilient \r\ncommunities. As we have critically examined the core \r\nof what it takes to be resilient, we have found that \r\nwhat looked insurmountable from a distance is not so \r\ndaunting up close.\r\nThat realization has buoyed our confidence and \r\nre-energized every Dominican. By the grace of God, \r\ntherefore, and with the continued support of our \r\npartners in the global community, we will become the \r\nfirst climate-resilient nation in the world. We encourage \r\nother vulnerable small island States to embark on \r\nbuilding resilience to climate change as well. The \r\ncosts, however, are above and beyond the capacity \r\nof small States. Support is critical from international \r\norganizations and their member States with the requisite \r\ntechnical expertise and financial resources.\r\nThe role of the United Nations is therefore central \r\nin coordinating and mobilizing resources. The creation \r\nof a special international climate-change resilience \r\nfacility to provide technical and financial resources \r\nshould be given the most urgent attention possible. The \r\nexisting global, economic and development architecture \r\nmust facilitate that new development paradigm. Official \r\ndevelopment assistance must be re-engineered to take \r\ninto account the vulnerability of small island States and \r\nthe imperative of building resilience to climate change. \r\nThe international financial institutions must rethink \r\nthe classification of debt. They must also rethink the \r\nessential services and vital infrastructure.\r\nAs we battle the effects of climate change, we \r\nare supremely conscious that there are many other \r\nchallenges confronting our region and the wider world. \r\nTwo emerging global problems brought on by climate \r\nchange are those of climate-induced migration and \r\ndisaster refugees. Although those problems are not yet \r\nfull-blown, some countries that act as safe havens have \r\nbegun to feel the pressures. That further underscores \r\nthe fact that the emerging problems brought on by \r\nthe effects of climate change require urgent global \r\nattention. Dominica calls on the United Nations to \r\nbegin the discourse on both climate migration and \r\ndisaster refugees while it is still early.\r\nWe champion our region as a zone of peace. We \r\nremain extremely concerned about the situation in our \r\nsister countries of Venezuela and Nicaragua. We call \r\nfor support for a process of dialogue in order to achieve \r\na peaceful resolution that can benefit of the citizens \r\nof those nations, while respecting and observing the \r\ntime-honoured international norms of respect for \r\nsovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof other nations.\r\nOver many years, this body has debated resolutions \r\non ending the economic and financial blockade of our \r\nsister country Cuba. We have long established the fact \r\nthat maintaining that trade embargo can have only a \r\nnegative impact on our brothers and sisters in Cuba. \r\nNotwithstanding the constraints it faces, the Republic of \r\nCuba has come to the aid of so many around the world, \r\nparticularly in the areas of health care and education, \r\nand sometimes in the most trying of circumstances. We \r\nonce again add our voice to the chorus of voices calling \r\nfor an end to that blockade.\r\nDominica supports a United Nations where \r\nyoung people, who account for more than 40 per \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n22/38 18-30196\r\ncent of the world’s population, can pursue a global \r\nyouth agenda with opportunities for dialogue on key \r\nissues that affect their development. Similarly, we \r\ncongratulate the stakeholder groups of persons with \r\ndisabilities and other non-State actors for their efforts \r\nto advance opportunities for persons with disabilities \r\nin order to ensure that they remain part of the United \r\nNations agenda.\r\nIf we keep looking down at our feet, we will die \r\nof sorrow. We choose to look up. We move forward, \r\nknowing that we are not alone on this challenging \r\njourney. Only 12 months ago, the international \r\ncommunity heard our cry and stood with us. That has \r\nmade us stronger and more motivated. To those who \r\ncame to our aid, we thank them and urge them to stay the \r\ncourse over the next few years. Let us set the example \r\nof a better future for all humankind. Let history record \r\nwhat we did, not what we said, and the efforts we made \r\nto end the march of climate change globally and reduce \r\nour vulnerabilities locally. We must grasp this moment \r\ntogether.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Jean-Claude Gakosso, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Cooperation of Congolese Living Abroad of the \r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Gakosso (Republic of the Congo) (spoke in \r\nFrench): It is my happy duty to address the General \r\nAssembly in this mythic and historic place, dedicated to \r\npeace around the world, on behalf of Mr. Denis Sassou \r\nNguesso, President of the Republic of the Congo, and \r\nhis Government. We can never say it enough — there is \r\nno alternative to peace. It is our firm belief that peace is \r\none of the most precious assets bestowed on us by God \r\nand our human intelligence. It is an invaluable treasure \r\nshared by all nations of the world, all peoples of the \r\nEarth and the entire community of States. We must \r\nnever forget that it is peace that is the raison d’être of \r\nthis wonderful institution that is the United Nations. It \r\nis peace that is the essential motive for our regular and \r\ndiligent meetings here.\r\nYet what do we see today when we take a panoramic \r\nlook at our world and the new ideologies emerging in \r\nit? We see persistent and worsening tensions between \r\nStates; a resurgence of nationalisms that we believed \r\noutdated; a normalization of sectarian discourse based \r\non a fetishistic glorification of identity; the xenophobic \r\ncontamination of certain social strata, ethnic and even \r\nracial intolerance and rejection of others, sometimes \r\naffecting entire populations; a questioning of the \r\ntremendous diversity of cultural expression that is \r\ncanonized here at the United Nations and that constitutes \r\nthe wealth of our world; the calling into question of \r\nmultilateralism, despite the fact that it continues to \r\nprovide a source of balance in international relations; \r\nand multiplying signs of rupture, particularly through \r\nthe undermining of the founding and inalienable \r\npremise of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of which we celebrate \r\nthis year.\r\nAt the same time, we see conflicts proliferating in \r\nvarious parts of the world, while senseless terrorism \r\nand violent extremism, often fuelled by religious \r\nproselytizing,  have almost taken hostage vast \r\nterritories that are then transformed into lawless areas, \r\nencouraged by the irrepressible vanity of individuals’ \r\nselfish geostrategic calculations. As we can see, our \r\nworld has entered a new period of uncertainty, perhaps \r\neven depravity. In some ways it brings back memories of \r\nthe gloomy decade of the 1930s in the previous century. \r\nThe proof is that the terrifying notion of wars between \r\nStates based on identity has violently resurfaced in our \r\nvocabulary, even if it is masked for the time being by \r\nthe euphemism of a trade war. That is all happening \r\nbefore our eyes, despite the fact that we all belong, \r\nwithout exception, to this divine and unique human \r\nrace, despite the fact that we are all inhabitants with \r\nequal rights and an equal part to play on this shared and \r\ntherefore crucial abode that is our planet.\r\nWhat can we say about the migration crisis and \r\nthe horrifying toll of thousands of lives, often young \r\nlives, that have been claimed by the deep abyss of the \r\nMediterranean Sea? How can we, the United Nations, \r\ngathered here in this peaceful and fraternal forum, \r\npeoples united in a community of destiny, stand idly \r\nby as our youth bleeds away on a scale unprecedented \r\nin history? How can we stand idle in the face of the \r\ntragic fate of a continent whose youth is being drained \r\naway before our eyes, depriving it of the vital forces of \r\nits valiant young people and the willing hands that are \r\nneeded to build the future of its countries? How can \r\nwe remain indifferent to such an enormous catastrophe, \r\nwhose long-term consequences will one day catch up \r\nwith us? How can we remain indifferent to so much \r\nsuffering and grief? It is clear that we must act, and \r\nwe must act together, resolutely and quickly, working \r\nto develop a United Nations that is relevant to all \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 23/38\r\npeoples, as the theme of the seventy-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly states.\r\nIndividually and collectively, we must all work to \r\nbuild and preserve peace in the world, because conflicts \r\neverywhere, regardless of their nature, have the same \r\nconsequences of destruction, frustration, injury and \r\nbruising. Conflicts are the result of public misery, and \r\nwe must therefore work to resolve them. That is a moral \r\nrequirement. It is precisely that moral requirement that \r\nhas for years inspired President Denis Sassou Nguesso \r\nof the Republic of the Congo, on whose behalf I have the \r\nhonour to speak today, in his tireless efforts for peace.\r\nIn seeking solutions to the serious crises that roil \r\nthe heart of Africa, my country — which since last \r\nyear has held the dual presidency of the International \r\nConference on the Great Lakes Region and the \r\nRegional Oversight Mechanism of the Peace, Security \r\nand Cooperation Framework for the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and the region — has therefore \r\nin a way become the seat of the African debate, the \r\nplace where summits of Heads of State and ministerial \r\nconferences, negotiations and consultations take place \r\nwith a view to ensuring peace in the region and beyond. \r\nWe issue strong recommendations to stakeholders and \r\nGovernments to shoulder more responsibility so that \r\nthe region can be permanently rid of armed violence \r\nand can focus on its own development.\r\nWith regard to the Central African region, the \r\nRepublic of Congo would like to commend the latest \r\npolitical developments in our neighbour the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, which will choose new leaders at \r\nthe end of this year. We once again applaud the effective \r\nimplementation of the electoral process in that country \r\nand call on all stakeholders in the process to prioritize \r\ndialogue, strengthen interaction and work to develop an \r\nappropriate balance so that all the elections can take \r\nplace in peace. We are also deeply concerned about \r\nthe upsurge in armed violence in the Central African \r\nRepublic. We appeal to the rebel groups that remain \r\nreluctant to join the peace process being courageously \r\nled by President Touadera to engage resolutely and in \r\ngood faith, while relying on the support of the panel \r\nof facilitators for the African Initiative for Peace and \r\nReconciliation and other facilitating entities.\r\nWith regard to the crisis in Libya, in connection \r\nwith which my country has received mandates from the \r\nAfrican Union Ad Hoc High-level Committee on Libya \r\nto seek solutions, the Republic of the Congo encourages \r\ninitiatives that can contribute to the speedy restoration \r\nof peace in Libya and throughout the continent. We \r\nsupport the idea of holding elections in Libya as soon \r\nas possible — general, inclusive, free, transparent and \r\ncredible elections — while we also consider it essential \r\nto create a context conducive to peacebuilding, \r\nincluding by organizing meetings for reconciliation and \r\nthe disarmament of militias, so that the elections do not \r\nadd further violence to violence.\r\nIn the Republic of the Congo itself, the Pool \r\ndepartment, in the country’s southern region, which \r\nuntil recently was gripped by a residual rebellion, has \r\nfinally found the joy of peace. Thanks to the combined \r\nefforts of the State authorities at the highest level and \r\ninternational partners, a ceasefire and cessation of \r\nhostilities agreement was reached on 23 December \r\n2017 and has gradually come into force. This is also \r\nthe appropriate forum in which to commend the \r\nsupport of the United Nations, particularly because the \r\nOrganization was able to quickly establish funding for \r\nour programmes for the disarmament, demobilization \r\nand reintegration of ex-combatants.\r\nFor the Republic of the Congo, the pursuit of the \r\nideals of peace and the achievement of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals for the benefit of humankind \r\nare essential commitments, including to improving \r\nthe integration of women and young people into \r\ndecision-making processes and implementing actions \r\naimed primarily at eradicating poverty in all its forms. \r\nIt is obvious that we cannot hope to build prosperous \r\nand peaceful societies if women, who make up half of \r\nhumankind, and young people, who are the builders of \r\ntomorrow’s world, do not fully enjoy their legitimate \r\nrights. That is why today my Government is prioritizing \r\nthose two sectors of the population, given that their \r\ndynamism constitutes one of the main drivers of our \r\ncountry’s economic growth.\r\nA few days ago, from this very rostrum, the \r\nSecretary-General of our Organization, Mr. António \r\nGuterres, called on the leaders of the world to delay \r\nno longer in protecting our planet from the disastrous \r\nconsequences of climate change. That call has \r\nparticular resonance in my country, which, as the \r\nAssembly is aware, is located in the heart of the Congo \r\nbasin forest. Our Government has been working for \r\nyears to preserve the invaluable heritage of Central \r\nAfrica’s huge equatorial forests and the extraordinary \r\nbiodiversity they contain.\r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n24/38 18-30196\r\nMr. Gata Mavita Wa Lufuta (Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo), Vice-President, took the Chair. From \r\nthis rostrum, I would also like to invite sponsors, \r\ndonors, philanthropists, nature lovers, those brothers \r\nand sisters who have been favoured by fortune, all \r\npeople of goodwill and all nations to join the peoples of \r\nthe world and the Governments of the Central African \r\ncountries in protecting the forests of the Congo basin in \r\norder to ensure clean and healthy air for our children, \r\nour descendants, all humankind and its offspring.\r\nFrom this rostrum and on behalf of my President, \r\nI solemnly call on the conscience of the world and \r\nall in this Assembly to join in a sacred union, under \r\nthe leadership of the United Nations, to give strength \r\nand vigour to the valuable instruments that we put \r\nin place following the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange — the Congo Basin Climate Commission \r\nand the Blue Fund for the Congo Basin, which are \r\ndesigned to improve the preservation of the Congo \r\nbasin forest, the world’s second-largest lung, whose \r\nimmense territory and exuberance are matched only by \r\nthose of the Amazon. Those instruments are awaiting \r\nour generous contributions, which will serve the cause \r\nof humankind by protecting life on this beautiful and \r\nirreplaceable blue planet.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. C. Peter David, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Labour of Grenada.\r\nMr. David (Grenada): I am pleased to extend the \r\nusual warm greetings from the Government and the \r\npeople of Grenada, on whose behalf I am privileged to \r\naddress this noble Organization and its Members.\r\nI join previous speakers in congratulating the \r\nPresident on her election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session. I am confident \r\nof her stewardship and assure her of my delegation’s \r\ncooperation and support. I am also pleased to join \r\nmy colleagues in thanking the outgoing President \r\nof the Assembly at its seventy-second session, \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák, for his able and focused \r\nleadership. I must also congratulate and thank \r\nSecretary-General António Guterres for his leadership \r\nof the United Nations, and express our deep gratitude, \r\nespecially for the keen interest he has shown in dealing \r\nwith the development challenges facing small island \r\ndeveloping States.\r\nThe Government and people of Grenada join others \r\naround the world in mourning the passing of the late \r\nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Mr. Annan, \r\nwho served the United Nations with distinction, was \r\na consummate diplomat and international statesman \r\nwho resolutely defended the ideals of international \r\npeace and security. The former Secretary-General \r\nwas a humanitarian who worked tirelessly to ensure \r\nthat disadvantaged persons around the world were \r\nafforded their human rights. His wise and courageous \r\nleadership helped place the issue of sustainable \r\ndevelopment on the international agenda through the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs \r\nhave since evolved into the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, another globally agreed framework designed to \r\nadvance the international development agenda.\r\nWe are acutely aware of how critical development \r\nissues are for small island developing States like Grenada, \r\nand we are indebted to Kofi Annan for initiating and \r\nspearheading that historic global movement. Today, as \r\nwe mourn his loss, we are comforted by the fact that his \r\nlegacy will continue to inspire generations of leaders \r\naround the world. There is one particular quote from \r\nour brother Kofi that resonates deeply and is very \r\nrelevant to the theme of this year’s session. He said,\r\n“To live is to choose. But to choose well, \r\nyou must know who you are and what you stand \r\nfor, where you want to go and why you want to \r\nget there.”\r\nAs States Members of this noble Organization, we \r\nmust deliberately choose to make the United Nations \r\nrelevant to all peoples. We must also choose a deliberate \r\npath to global leadership that promotes shared \r\nresponsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties. Grenada also joins the rest of the United \r\nNations community in honouring the late South African \r\nhero and international statesman, Nelson Mandela, on \r\nthe centenary of his birth. This tribute comes at a time \r\nwhen the international community is looking to leaders \r\nwho understand the necessity of fostering international \r\nsolidarity and cooperation, leaders who bring people \r\ntogether and make sacrifices for the greater good. \r\nThe global community has no better example of that \r\nthan the late great Madiba. It is our hope that leaders \r\neverywhere will work diligently to uphold his staunch \r\nlegacy of promoting peace, equality and human dignity.\r\nThis session of the Assembly is taking place \r\nin a global context characterized by changing \r\npolitical, ideological and religious tensions, social \r\nrevolution and an increasing anxiety about economic, \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 25/38\r\nsocial and political inequality and marginalization. \r\nThose global changes are magnified, especially \r\nfor developing States, in the face of challenging \r\nphenomena such as climate change, natural disasters \r\nand non-communicable diseases. With limited access \r\nto development financing, those challenges are further \r\nexacerbated. Pursuing policies and strategies for \r\nconfronting those challenges, with the corresponding \r\nextraordinary solutions, is the path we must follow in \r\norder to secure more sustainable societies.\r\nWe are well into the 2018 hurricane season and yet \r\nthe Caribbean is still recovering from that of 2017, one \r\nof the most devastating hurricane seasons the world has \r\nseen. We have been holding our breath as this year’s \r\nvarious tropical systems — Beryl, Isaac and just this \r\nweek, Kirk — take aim at our region. Such weather \r\nsystems are yet another reminder of the vulnerability of \r\nour region and the realities of climate change, capable \r\nof eviscerating entire industries in a matter of hours. \r\nThat is especially evident in our region, which is heavily \r\ndependent on agriculture and tourism, and where any \r\ndamage to property or infrastructure is significant.\r\nYet there is hope. Too often we talk about \r\nthe disadvantages of small nations. The global \r\nclimate-change challenge offers us an opportunity not \r\nonly to highlight our vulnerability but also to focus \r\non the distinct advantages of being small States. The \r\nCaribbean and other small island developing States \r\ncan serve as proving grounds for the nationwide \r\nimplementation of climate-related technologies and \r\nadvances. We also represent some of the most globally \r\ncompelling business cases for sustainable and renewable \r\nenergy investment.\r\nBeing climate-smart goes beyond policies. It \r\ngoes beyond resilient housing, infrastructure and \r\nagriculture. It means that the region can also serve \r\nas a global beacon for renewable energy and energy \r\nefficiency. We aim to be resilient, and with our \r\nregion’s tremendous potential in hydroelectricity and \r\ngeothermal energy, we could also be climate-smart. \r\nIn understanding the need to rethink our adaptation \r\nto climate change, the Government of Grenada has \r\nestablished a new, overarching Ministry of Climate \r\nResilience, the Environment, Forestry, Fisheries, \r\nDisaster Management and Information. Its mandate \r\nis to work speedily to ensure that engrained in every \r\naspect of our country’s development is the question of \r\naddressing climate change and climate resilience.\r\nGrenada is also currently shifting some of its \r\nmacroeconomic focus so as to ensure that attention \r\nis paid to the development of our green and blue \r\neconomies, thereby tying economic development and \r\nenvironmental sustainability together. The road to \r\nclimate-smart sustainability is long and arduous, but it \r\nis not insurmountable, and we must ensure that we are \r\nstrategic on that journey. In building climate-smart and \r\nsustainable societies, we cannot overlook the inherent \r\nneed to improve the health of our citizens and the \r\nconditions needed to foster good health.\r\nUnfortunately, like many Caribbean Community \r\nStates and other developing nations, Grenada struggles \r\nwith the scourge of non-communicable diseases. In order \r\nto avoid repeating some of the alarming health statistics \r\nthat confront and challenge us developmentally, I wish \r\nonly to emphasize that our Government calls for global \r\nleadership and looks forward to international solutions \r\nthat can preserve the health of our people, promote \r\nlongevity and sustain our future. Indeed, the successful \r\ncompletion of this week’s high-level meetings on \r\nnon-communicable diseases and tuberculosis is \r\nencouraging, particularly in the commitments set \r\nforth in the political declarations laudably adopted by \r\nconsensus. Now is the time to scale up our efforts to \r\nensure that we honour those commitments.\r\nAs we attempt to create sustainable societies, we \r\nare confronted with certain global financial policies \r\nand actions that pose significant threats to our \r\nregion’s sustainable development. Measures such as \r\nthe withdrawal of correspondent banking services, \r\nalong with de-risking, blacklisting and graduation to \r\nmiddle-income status, negatively affect Caribbean \r\neconomies. The unilateral and premature graduation of \r\nmany small island developing States to middle-income \r\nstatus, without consideration of our region’s specific \r\nvulnerabilities, has resulted in significant budgetary \r\nshortfalls that adversely affect our economic and \r\nsocial development. Our region has inherent structural \r\neconomic challenges that already restrict the pace of \r\nour development. We ask that those impediments to \r\ngrowth be taken into account when our cases come up \r\nfor consideration.\r\nThe Caribbean Development Bank has pioneered \r\nthe use of vulnerability indices when setting the terms \r\nfor its financing. We also urge international partners \r\nto work towards an acceptable vulnerability index \r\nthat holistically assesses our countries’ development \r\nrisks. On top of that, the withdrawal of correspondent \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n26/38 18-30196\r\nbanking services from Caribbean Community \r\nmember States can be seen as an economic assault \r\nthat will destabilize the financial sector of our already \r\nvulnerable economies. Remittances contribute in real \r\nand significant terms to the gross domestic product \r\nof small States. In fact, the World Bank has said that \r\nany sudden halt to remittances in economies that rely \r\non those f lows could pose a significant threat to their \r\nsocioeconomic stability.\r\nIn addition to the threat of lost correspondent \r\nbanking relationships, we must also contend with the \r\nunilateral and often unfounded blacklisting of our \r\ninstitutions as money-launderers and our countries as \r\ntax havens. It pains us as policymakers when we expend \r\nour limited resources to comply with international rules, \r\nonly to face arbitrary punishments when we are quite \r\nevidently doing our best. There are no easy answers to \r\nthose challenges, but I urge our partners to desist from \r\ndraconian approaches to those matters when dealing \r\nwith vulnerable developing nations.\r\nGrenada continues to work with our international \r\npartners to advance international peace and security. \r\nGrenada’s position on the development of nuclear \r\nweapons is clear. It is inherently destructive and \r\ntherefore serves no good purpose for humankind. \r\nDeterrence makes sense only where there is the \r\npossibility of deployment. The mere existence of those \r\nweapons anywhere is unacceptable. Grenada therefore \r\nurges its friends to desist from the development and \r\ntesting of such weapons. Imagine what we could \r\nachieve instead if we put our brilliant scientists to work \r\non climate change and building climate-smart resilient \r\nand sustainable societies.\r\nAs we strive to maintain the Caribbean region as a \r\nzone of peace, some of us continue to be affected by the \r\ntraffic in small arms from countries that manufacture \r\nand sell them freely. In some of our islands, states \r\nof emergency have been declared at various times to \r\ncontrol criminal activity resulting from the increasing \r\navailability and use of small arms. Small arms and gun \r\nviolence undermine the rule of law and are often major \r\nfactors behind the displacement of civilians and the \r\nviolation of human rights. We cannot build sustainable \r\nsocieties if our public security is incessantly threatened \r\nby that scourge.\r\nThe main purpose of the United Nations is to \r\nmaintain international peace and security and prevent \r\nviolence and war. The Charter of the United Nations \r\nactually makes only five references to war, while there \r\nare 47 references to peace. That is extremely instructive \r\nand it is therefore imperative to ensure that the global \r\nleadership takes decisive action. Indeed, as we strive to \r\ncreate sustainable societies, the people of Cuba continue \r\nto suffer under the decades-old unjust embargo imposed \r\non them by the United States of America. Grenada \r\ncontinues to call for the immediate lifting of the unfair \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba, \r\nand strongly supports resolution 70/5, which calls for \r\nan end to the dreadful embargo.\r\nSome of our neighbours in Latin America are \r\ncurrently experiencing political and economic \r\nchallenges that threaten the peaceful existence, \r\nsustainable development and by extension the stability \r\nof the region. Grenada calls for dialogue and asks that \r\ngood sense and wisdom prevail in all attempts aimed at \r\nresolving those conflicts. We also call for respect for \r\nthe political integrity and sovereignty of those States. \r\nThe Government of Grenada continues to offer its hand \r\nin good faith to facilitate dialogue aimed at settling \r\nthose disputes.\r\nIn conclusion, I implore Members to work \r\nrelentlessly in our pursuit of the purposes of the \r\nOrganization. Our quest must be for the pursuit of \r\neconomic opportunities as we strive to achieve peaceful, \r\nequitable and sustainable societies for all. Those ideals \r\nwill be beyond our reach if we do not promote, encourage \r\nand insist on resolute global leadership in solving our \r\ndevelopment challenges, which transcend boundaries.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Ahmed Awad Isse, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Somalia.\r\nMr. Isse (Somalia): I would like to begin by \r\ncongratulating the President and her country of \r\nEcuador on her election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly this year. Let me also thank the President’s \r\npredecessor for steering the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session with admirable skill. On behalf \r\nof my Government and the people of Somalia, our \r\nsympathies and condolences go to the Government and \r\nthe people of Indonesia, who have suffered as a result \r\nof the recent deadly tsunami that has claimed hundreds \r\nof human lives.\r\nIt is a profound honour for me to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on behalf of the President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Somalia. Our Administration has \r\nnow completed one and a half years in office, and I am \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 27/38\r\nglad to say that we have made huge strides in security-\r\nsector reform and in our political and economic \r\ntransformation. We are, however, mindful of the \r\nenormous challenges that we face in fixing Somalia, \r\nand especially in overcoming the threats of terrorism.\r\nI am equally mindful of the huge expectations \r\nthat our people have for our President’s leadership and \r\nhis ability to provide lasting solutions to our security \r\nchallenges. It is for that reason that our President, His \r\nExcellency Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed Farmajo, \r\nrecently spent six weeks at our defence headquarters \r\nand time at various defence positions, giving directions \r\nand providing on-the-ground approvals at forward \r\noperating bases.\r\nWe have initiated a new round of operations that \r\nhave successfully opened up road networks and supply \r\nroutes and thereby have liberated towns and villages \r\nfrom occupation by Al-Shabaab terrorists. We recognize \r\nthat providing lasting solutions to the challenge of \r\nsecurity is an immense undertaking that needs a \r\nmultifaceted approach. While we and our partners are \r\ntaking out and dismantling all the terrorists’ hideouts \r\nby military means, we are also engaging our religious \r\nleaders, elders, young people, women and civil-society \r\ngroups so that we can turn the tide against the twisted \r\nideology of hate and religious intolerance.\r\nThe silver lining is that young men and women are \r\nnot voluntarily joining Al-Shabaab. That ideology is no \r\nlonger popular, and Al-Shabaab and Al-Qaida no longer \r\nhave a ready stream of new and volunteer recruits in \r\nSomalia. It is also important to note that some within \r\ntheir ranks, mostly young men and women, have heeded \r\nour amnesty offer, renounced violence and peacefully \r\nsurrendered. Senior commanders, former sector heads \r\nand infantrymen have unconditionally surrendered \r\nas well, bringing with them their arsenals and their \r\nnon-standard tactical vehicles, known in military terms \r\nas “technicals”. The combination of those factors has \r\nfurther weakened the terror network’s logistical and \r\nplanning capabilities.\r\nAl-Shabaab now largely exists as an amorphous \r\nnetwork operating as an irregular outfit that plans terror \r\nattacks from the shadows, but not as a strong insurgent \r\nforce that can sustain resistance. We are now engaged \r\nin creating civil networks aimed at encouraging a \r\nhealthy partnership between law enforcement and \r\ncommunities that can f lush out terrorist remnants. \r\nOur people acknowledge that sustaining security is a \r\ncollective responsibility, and in turn that awareness \r\nhas helped us establish effective policing models that \r\ninvolve the public.\r\nOur quest for a peaceful and stable Somalia will \r\nnot end when Al-Shabaab is defeated, but that is the \r\nfirst step. Our comprehensive security-sector reform \r\nis our basis for developing capacity, streamlining, \r\nstrategizing and implementing a practical transition \r\nthat envisions an effective security force and stable \r\nsecurity institutions.\r\nWe recognize that promoting justice, respecting \r\nthe rule of law and protecting peoples’ rights are key \r\ncomponents in peace-building. That quest includes \r\nan organized, gradual and systematic transfer of \r\nsecurity tasks to appropriate forces, as agreed in \r\nour national security architecture, while at the same \r\ntime establishing political and economic measures to \r\nsupport and sustain the transition at the federal, state \r\nand community levels.\r\nOn behalf of the people of Somalia, I want to say \r\nunequivocally that we are truly grateful to the brave \r\nmen and women who have served and continue to serve \r\nin the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). \r\nThey have made huge sacrifices to keep our people \r\nsafe, and that will never be forgotten. We remain in \r\ntheir debt.\r\nIn order to consolidate our collective security gains \r\nand further support our Somali security institutions \r\nso that we can take over from AMISOM, I call on the \r\nUnited Nations to lift the long-standing arms embargo \r\non Somalia, which is now preventing us from levelling \r\nthe field in our battle with terrorist groups. When our \r\nfighting arsenal is only equal to the enemy’s, the odds \r\nare split. A stronger fighting capacity would give us \r\nthe upper hand and enable us to entirely dismantle the \r\nterrorists, and possibly in a shorter time.\r\nOur Administration’s foremost objective is \r\nexpanding the democratic space available to our people. \r\nIt should be considered sacrosanct that every Somali \r\nshould enjoy the inalienable rights to life, freedom and \r\nprotection enshrined in our provisional Constitution, \r\nincluding freedom of the press, freedom of association \r\nand even the freedom to petition the Government for \r\nthe redress of grievances. That is why we are winning \r\nthe fight against terrorists. Our people have been \r\nsuppressed and subjugated for a long time by terrorist \r\nnetworks, and those freedoms and protections mean a \r\nlot to them. Individually and collectively, our people \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n28/38 18-30196\r\nand communities recognize that it is the responsibility \r\nof their Government to protect their liberties. Our \r\npeople also appreciate the fact that for the Government \r\nto do so, we must all operate within the terms of \r\nour Constitution.\r\nOne of our core values is protecting, supporting \r\nand providing a platform for minority groups and \r\ncommunities and those with special needs. Our people \r\nacknowledge that for our system of governance to be \r\neffective, the rule of law must reign supreme. Only \r\nthen can we attain the vision of a prosperous Somalia. \r\nAs we mark 18 years since the rebirth of our Republic \r\nin Arta, Djibouti, our quest for an inclusive, reformed \r\npolitical system is now on the right track. We have an \r\nagreed election model, adopted jointly by the central \r\nGovernment and the federal member states in Baidoa \r\nin June and endorsed by the international community \r\nin Brussels during the Somalia Partnership Forum in \r\nJuly. We note that it is the election period for some \r\nof the federal member states. Our role, as the central \r\nGovernment, will be to promote transparent, free and \r\nfair processes.\r\nWe have set specific goals with regard to economic \r\ndevelopment and have established frameworks for \r\nkey deliverables in attaining our goals for sustainable \r\nproductivity in the areas of agriculture, fisheries \r\nand livestock. Somalia enjoys the double blessing of \r\na strategic location in the Horn of Africa and a vast \r\nwealth of natural resources. Significant oil reserves, \r\nnatural gas, iron ore and arable and productive land, \r\nas well as Africa’s second-longest coastline after the \r\nisland of Madagascar, provide enormous opportunities \r\nfor sustainable output.\r\nMy Government’s objective is to tap into those \r\nopportunities, transform our economy, streamline our \r\ntrade and investment policies, and open up new trade \r\nroutes and horizons for our people. In that regard, we are \r\nseeking to strengthen alliances with our core partners \r\nso as to promote trade and investment opportunities, \r\neven as we widen our scope in our quest for broader, \r\nfar-reaching economic cooperation. We seek to \r\nstrengthen strategic partnerships with our neighbours, \r\nthe continent and the world, where we share mutual \r\ninterests in economic development, security and \r\nsocial cooperation.\r\nOne of our Government’s key priorities is \r\npromoting sustainable fiscal policies aimed at growing \r\nour economy and instilling the discipline required \r\nto maintain it. Somalia is committed to working \r\npurposefully for financial self-sufficiency and the \r\nachievement of the crucial Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. Through the International Monetary Fund’s \r\nstaff-monitored programme, we have raised domestic \r\nrevenue to unprecedented levels, and we are in the \r\nprocess of normalizing relations with international \r\nfinancial institutions through continuing dialogue and \r\nmeaningful engagement. Those efforts are edging us \r\ncloser to debt relief.\r\nSomalia is committed to boosting economic \r\nintegration and free trade f lows across the region. The \r\nHorn of Africa is undergoing a remarkable political \r\nand economic transformation. Somalia is proud to \r\nbe playing a leading role in the quest for the region’s \r\neconomic integration and to be serving as a mediator \r\nin the effort to end the decades-long conflicts that have \r\ndogged the region. We are pleased to be contributing \r\ntowards realizing the African Union’s goal of silencing \r\nthe guns by 2020.\r\nA new dawn of leadership is at hand in the Horn \r\nof Africa. A stronger desire to bolster historical ties \r\nfor shared interests represents a means for effective \r\ncooperation among the countries of the region. In order \r\nto achieve our common goal of economic progress \r\nand prosperity for the Horn of Africa, I humbly call \r\non the United Nations to lift all economic sanctions on \r\nour neighbour, Eritrea. Such a move would improve \r\nthe f low of imports and exports and the movement of \r\npeople and businesses, and it would fulfil our vision for \r\nthe successful economic integration of the region.\r\nThere is evidence everywhere that Africa is \r\nmoving towards greater connectivity and prosperity. \r\nEast Africa is becoming the continent’s fastest-growing \r\nregion as Africa becomes the world’s largest free \r\ntrade area. It is time for us to focus on and encourage \r\nintra-African investment. Somalia, with its resource \r\npotential, is committed to moving with the continent. \r\nWe have recently joined the Common Market for \r\nEastern and Southern Africa trade bloc, and we have \r\nalso applied for membership in a number of other trade \r\nand economic blocs.\r\nIt is only by expanding the prospects for open \r\nmarkets, free trade, investments and policies that ease \r\nthe movement of people and businesses between the \r\ncountries of Africa that we can bring about solutions \r\nto the domestic, economic and social challenges that \r\nwe face, as we work towards realizing the African \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 29/38\r\nUnion’s Agenda 2063. We need to formulate joint \r\npolicies that provide lasting solutions to the problem \r\nof illegal immigration and that expand our scope and \r\nvision for economic and social progress, which in turn \r\nwill help to create jobs and opportunities for our young \r\npeople, provide meaningful employment and improve \r\nthe quality of education. It can no longer be business \r\nas usual when, year in and year out, we are losing \r\nhundreds of productive young men and women to the \r\nMediterranean, ostensibly in search of better living \r\nprospects. It is ironic that this is happening as the \r\nworld is focusing on Africa for its resources, markets \r\nand labour.\r\nI am hopeful that better days and better prospects \r\nlie ahead for all of us. For Somalia, it is the beginning \r\nof a transformation. We have risen anew and afresh. \r\nWe are not only optimistic but also motivated, as our \r\nsecurity is improving, our economy is on an upward \r\ntrend and our foreign policy has already received \r\naccolades in the region and beyond. We are focused \r\non keeping pace with the ever-changing economic and \r\ntechnological dynamics of today, and we are embracing \r\nnew ideas. As such, we are open to all investments, and \r\nwe are ready to do business.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Alpha Barry, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Burkina Faso.\r\nMr. Barry (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): In the \r\n73 years since our Organization was created, Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés is the fourth woman to be \r\nelected President of the General Assembly, and only the \r\nsecond in half a century. Her election deserves to be \r\nparticularly welcomed and that is why, on behalf of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, President \r\nof Burkina Faso, whom I have the honour to represent \r\nhere, as well as on behalf of my delegation, I offer her \r\nmy warmest and most sincere congratulations. Burkina \r\nFaso, a Vice-President of the General Assembly at this \r\nsession, will spare no effort to ensure the success of \r\nour work.\r\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, \r\nwhose actions since he took office have not gone \r\nunnoticed, I reaffirm Burkina Faso’s full support for \r\nhis commitment and determination to bring about \r\nimportant and ambitious reforms to make the United \r\nNations more effective.\r\nBefore continuing, I want to spare a thought for \r\nthe brotherly and friendly people of Indonesia, who \r\nhave been severely tested today by an earthquake and \r\na tsunami. On behalf of President Kaboré, I extend \r\nour sincere condolences and deepest sympathies to the \r\nGovernment and the people of Indonesia and to the \r\nfamilies of the victims. We also wish the many injured \r\na swift recovery.\r\nBurkina Faso has been tirelessly pursuing its efforts \r\nto strengthen democracy and consolidate the rule of \r\nlaw through many measures, including finalizing the \r\npreliminary draft of our new Constitution and, on 30 July, \r\nrevising the law on the electoral code. Referendum \r\nconsultations are scheduled for 2019. Our future \r\nConstitution, drafted in a consultative framework, aims \r\nto strengthen human rights and civil liberties, taking \r\ninto account other new provisions, such as access to \r\nland for all, the right to clean drinking water, the right \r\nto employment and the abolition of the death penalty. \r\nFurther provisions are planned to introduce balance \r\ninto the distribution of power. In addition, the process \r\nof revising the electoral code will pave the way for \r\nBurkina Faso citizens overseas to vote, allowing them \r\nto participate in the presidential elections in 2020 for \r\nthe first time in our country’s history.\r\nMeanwhile, many other reforms have been launched \r\nto improve political and economic governance, \r\nmodernize the Administration, consolidate public \r\nfinances and strengthen the independence of the \r\njudiciary, as well as human rights. On the economic \r\nfront, despite a difficult security and social context, \r\nBurkina Faso has attained a growth rate of 6.7 per \r\ncent thanks to the consolidation of public finances, the \r\ninitiation of reforms to improve tax revenues and the \r\nstructuring of projects launched within the framework \r\nof the national economic and social development plan. \r\nThe fruits of that growth have been redistributed by \r\nbuilding infrastructure and adopting social measures in \r\nfavour of our most underprivileged citizens, particularly \r\nwomen and girls. Our free health-care policy has \r\nsignificantly improved care for pregnant women and \r\nchildren under the age of five and will continue with \r\nthe operationalization of a universal health-insurance \r\nsystem that will gradually enable health-care coverage \r\nto be extended to all Burkina Faso citizens.\r\nIn terms of public health and access to drinking \r\nwater, substantial efforts have been made to benefit \r\nrural and urban areas. Likewise, our special job-\r\ncreation programme for young people and women \r\naims to promote their access to jobs and acquisition \r\nof vocational skills, with a view to opening up \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n30/38 18-30196\r\nopportunities for their sustainable integration into \r\nthe labour market. In addition, an integrated women’s \r\nempowerment programme aims to strengthen their \r\nproductive capacities and their participation in Burkina \r\nFaso’s economic and social development by 2020.\r\nBurkina Faso remains very concerned about \r\nthe insecurity and terrorist attacks that it has been \r\nsubjected to for the past three years. Once limited to \r\nour northern regions, the terrorist threat has gradually \r\nspread to other areas, especially the south-west and \r\nthe east, which border on Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana and \r\nthe Niger, Benin and Togo respectively. In the space of \r\nthree years, 229 civilians and military or paramilitary \r\ntroops have been killed by armed terrorist groups.\r\nIn order to tackle that worrying situation, my \r\nGovernment is mobilizing all its human, financial, \r\nmilitary, non-military and material resources to combat \r\nthis terrible threat and ensure the people’s security. \r\nUnfortunately, our unconscionable and faithless enemies \r\nwill stop at nothing to sow their seeds of terror. Their \r\nnew modus operandi is the use of improvised explosive \r\ndevices. To provide some context, they have blown up \r\ntwo vehicles this week alone using such fatal devices, \r\nkilling 14 members of our defence and security forces \r\nparticipating in security operations within our borders.\r\nBesides attacking our defence and security forces, \r\nsymbols of the State, the terrorists have been targeting \r\ncivilians, students and teachers. More than 520 schools \r\nhave closed, depriving nearly 56,000 students of their \r\nright to an education owing to the terrorist threat. \r\nBy targeting schools, armed terrorist groups are \r\nattacking the education system generally, and thereby \r\neducated people — people who would try to thwart the \r\ndissemination of the terrorists’ ideas and way of life. \r\nThe terrorists know that an educated and enlightened \r\nperson is more difficult to manipulate than one \r\nwithout education. Far from causing us to lose heart, \r\nthose attacks have reinforced our unity, solidarity \r\nand determination to defend the values that underpin \r\nBurkina Faso — our republican form of Government, \r\ndemocracy, secularism and social cohesion.\r\nIn the fight against terrorism, one thing is \r\nunanimously acknowledged, which is that no one \r\ncountry can combat that threat alone. Even by coming \r\ntogether, as the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) \r\ncountries have done in order to pool their efforts, the fact \r\nremains that our countries absolutely need the support \r\nof the international community to render the G-5 Sahel \r\nJoint Force operational. Beyond the countries directly \r\naffected by the terrible phenomenon of terrorism, the \r\nfight against terrorism is directly related to our broader \r\nneed for international peace and security.\r\nIndeed, in its resolution 72/165 of 19 December \r\n2017, proclaiming 21 August the International Day \r\nof Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of \r\nTerrorism, the General Assembly reaffirmed its \r\nunwavering commitment to strengthening international \r\ncooperation to prevent and fight terrorism in all its \r\nforms and manifestations. In that regard, Burkina \r\nFaso appeals to the Security Council to place the \r\nG-5 Sahel Joint Force under a mandate deriving from \r\nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, with \r\na view to ensuring that it receives sustainable and \r\nmultilateral financing.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to recall \r\nthat the Security Council, by its resolutions 2320 (2016) \r\nand 2378 (2017), has already expressed its intention to \r\ntake concrete steps to establish the principles under \r\nwhich African Union peace operations authorized by \r\nthe Security Council should be funded through United \r\nNations assessed contributions, with decisions on \r\nfunding specific missions to be taken on a case-by-case \r\nbasis. At the seventy-second session, President Lajčák \r\nreminded us that\r\n“peace and prevention should be at the centre of \r\neverything the United Nations does, because when \r\nwe read the Charter of the United Nations, there \r\nare only five references to war. The word ‘peace’, \r\nhowever, appears 47 times” (A/72/PV.3, p.5).\r\nTherefore, pursuant to General Assembly \r\nresolution 70/262 and Security Council resolution 2282 \r\n(2016), both adopted on 27 April 2016, the high-level \r\nmeeting on peacebuilding and sustaining peace (see \r\nA/72/PV.83 et seq.) held from 24 to 25 April placed \r\nparticular emphasis on prevention. Indeed, prevention \r\nis at the heart of building and sustaining peace and must \r\ntherefore be a primary objective for both States and the \r\nUnited Nations. It is also the primary responsibility \r\nof national Governments to determine the necessary \r\npriorities and strategies by involving every stratum \r\nof society. In order to consolidate peace, we must \r\naddress the root causes of conflict, such as poverty, \r\nexclusion, discrimination — and, indeed, the effects of \r\nclimate change.\r\nIt is for that reason that the Government of Burkina \r\nFaso launched an emergency programme for the Sahel \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 31/38\r\nfor the period from 2017 to 2020 as a holistic response \r\nto the region’s dual socioeconomic and security \r\nchallenges, through the realization of socioeconomic \r\ninfrastructure projects and the establishment of basic \r\nsocial services, as well as the promotion of production \r\nand processing activities as sources of income for the \r\npeople in the northern areas of our country. Initiatives \r\nfor building and sustaining peace can succeed only if \r\nthey receive sufficient, predictable, sustainable and \r\ncoherent funding by involving multilateral and bilateral \r\npartners, as well as the private sector. Burkina Faso \r\nwelcomes and applauds the support that it enjoys from \r\nthe United Nations system and from the European Union \r\nin the implementation of that emergency programme.\r\nThe purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations are aimed at achieving a world of \r\npeace, justice, solidarity and social well-being for all, \r\non a planet that is not threatened by climate change. \r\nThe support that many countries like Burkina Faso \r\nreceive from the United Nations system for their \r\nefforts to achieve development, and thereby the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, is highly appreciated. \r\nThat is why we welcome the unanimous adoption of \r\nresolution 72/279, on repositioning the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system, which provides for a revitalization \r\nof the role of the resident coordinator system.\r\nBurkina Faso welcomes the support given to the \r\nSahel countries through the United Nations Support \r\nPlan for the Sahel. The Plan, which covers the period \r\nfrom 2018 to 2030, will improve coordination and \r\nstrengthen collaboration among the partners in the \r\nregion. In addition, it will help to implement the \r\npriorities identified for the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the African \r\nUnion’s Agenda 2063.\r\nIt is now more necessary than ever that we defend \r\nand encourage multilateralism. That is the belief of \r\nBurkina Faso, and it must be a vision shared by all if we \r\nare to create a more open and more inclusive world. It \r\nis in the name of international solidarity that Burkina \r\nFaso is now engaged in six peacekeeping operations \r\nwith more than 2,000 personnel, making our country a \r\nmajor actor in United Nations peacekeeping operations. \r\nWe are also one of the few countries — one of only \r\nthree, in fact — that maintain a military contingent \r\nin Guinea-Bissau responsible for the security of its \r\nrepublican institutions. Burkina Faso is the largest \r\ntroop-contributing country to the United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in \r\nMali and the largest contributor of correctional officers \r\nto the United Nations. In that capacity, we will succeed \r\nCanada as Chair of the Group of Friends of Corrections \r\nin Peace Operations for a one-year term.\r\nBecause the credibility and effectiveness of the \r\nUnited Nations also depend on its ability to prevent \r\nand manage crises and to promote international peace \r\nand security, Burkina Faso welcomes the reforms of \r\nmanagement and of the peace and security pillar, which \r\nshould improve the ability of the United Nations to \r\neffectively carry out its mission of sustainable peace \r\nand social progress for citizens around the world. \r\nBurkina Faso commends the Secretary-General’s \r\nAction for Peacekeeping initiative and the holding of a \r\nhigh-level meeting on that initiative at this session. The \r\nadoption of the Declaration of Shared Commitments on \r\nUnited Nations Peacekeeping Operations highlights the \r\nachievements of peacekeeping operations and enables \r\nus to reaffirm our shared commitment to addressing the \r\nmost pressing challenges.\r\nAs peace, security, democracy, respect for human \r\nrights and development are intrinsically linked, we \r\nmust work to ensure that all countries in crisis find \r\npeace. That is why Burkina Faso congratulates the \r\nGovernment and the people of Mali on their successful \r\nholding of presidential elections, despite the context \r\nthere of terrorist threats, and calls on the Malian political \r\nclass to stand together in making every possible effort \r\nto overcome that enemy. The peace agreement between \r\nthe political leaders of South Sudan also merits high \r\npraise. On the subject of Western Sahara, Burkina \r\nFaso welcomes the announcement of the resumption of \r\nnegotiations before the end of the year.\r\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to be of \r\nreal concern, and Burkina Faso remains convinced that \r\na solution must be political, peaceful, just and equitable, \r\nbased on the existence of two States living side by side \r\nwithin secure and recognized borders. In Asia, the \r\ncommencement of dialogue between the two Koreas is \r\na good sign and should be encouraged and supported \r\nby the international community. Burkina Faso strongly \r\nendorses their dialogue. With regard to the economic, \r\nfinancial and commercial embargo against Cuba, \r\nBurkina Faso calls for it to be completely lifted.\r\nThe proliferation of small arms and light weapons \r\nposes a threat to peace and security in various parts \r\nof the world and is an obstacle to achieving the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. That is why my \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n32/38 18-30196\r\ncountry welcomes the inclusion of ammunition in the \r\nfinal document (A/CONF.192/2018/RC/3) of the Third \r\nUnited Nations Conference to Review Progress Made \r\nin the Implementation of the Programme of Action \r\nto Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in \r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects.\r\nWith regard to weapons of mass destruction, we \r\ncondemn the resurgence of the use of chemical weapons \r\nin recent years and call for general and complete \r\ndisarmament where all weapons of mass destruction \r\nconcerned.\r\nHumanitarian issues are of paramount importance \r\nin view of the growing number of refugees and migrants \r\naround the world. Burkina Faso therefore welcomes the \r\ninclusive negotiation process that has resulted in the \r\ndrafting of consensus-based texts for a global compact \r\nfor safe, orderly and regular migration, scheduled \r\nto be adopted at the Intergovernmental Conference \r\non the Global Compact for Migration, to be held on \r\nAfrican soil in Marrakech on 10 and 11 December. As \r\na migration country, with at least 4 million citizens \r\nliving abroad and nearly 25,000 refugees on its \r\nterritory, Burkina Faso intends to play an active role in \r\nthe adoption of the two global compacts on migration \r\nand on refugees. They should help not only to establish \r\neffective migration management around the world but \r\nalso to better protect refugees and migrants.\r\nBurkina Faso also welcomes the organization \r\non the margins of the seventy-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly of high-level events on topics such \r\nas tuberculosis and non-communicable diseases. There \r\nis no doubt that the recommendations resulting from \r\nthose two events will contribute to improving the \r\nmanagement of those diseases, which have a negative \r\nimpact on people’s lives.\r\nIntergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform have been going on for more than 20 years, with \r\n13 rounds of negotiations, but no comprehensive and \r\nsatisfactory solution has emerged, even though the \r\nvast majority of Member States agree in principle on \r\nhaving a Security Council that is more representative, \r\nbetter adapted to contemporary realities and better \r\nable to quickly respond to crises. With the support of \r\nthe majority of Member States, we must now move \r\ntowards text-based negotiations, which is the only way \r\nto advance towards a genuine and consensual solution. \r\nWe sincerely hope that we can achieve reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, as it would redress the injustice done \r\nto Africa, which deserves a permanent place on the \r\nSecurity Council, and should have one.\r\nWhile all of the themes of the sessions of the General \r\nAssembly command our attention, this year’s theme, \r\n“Making the United Nations relevant to all people: global \r\nleadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, \r\nequitable and sustainable societies”, challenges us \r\neven more. Its implementation also requires adequate \r\nrepresentation for all Member States in the bodies of our \r\nOrganization. In that connection, Burkina Faso calls \r\nfor universal support for the candidacy of Mr. Brahima \r\nSanou for the post of Deputy Secretary-General of \r\nthe International Telecommunications Union, in the \r\nelections scheduled for the Union’s plenipotentiary \r\nconference, to be held from 29 October to 16 November \r\nin the United Arab Emirates.\r\nDespite its 73 years of existence, our Organization \r\nmust continue to work to strengthen itself and to \r\nassure people of its relevance and importance. \r\nBuilding an equitable world in a peaceful and healthy \r\nenvironment is a shared and long-term undertaking \r\nand a responsibility that we all share. Let us therefore \r\ntrust our Organization, the only framework that \r\nenables us to remain united in strong action and that \r\ncreates greater hopes for the peoples of the world. \r\nTo that end, I want to pay a well-deserved tribute to \r\na great man and a worthy son of Africa who stood at \r\nthe helm of our shared Organization. I am referring, of \r\ncourse, to the late Mr. Kofi Annan.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate for \r\nthis meeting.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in exercise of \r\nthe right of reply, I would like to remind members that \r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are limited \r\nto 10 minutes for the first intervention and 5 minutes \r\nfor the second, and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Al-Kuwari (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ncountry’s delegation would like to exercise its right \r\nof reply in response to the false accusations in the \r\nstatements of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain \r\n(see A/73/PV.14).\r\nThe international community realizes full well that \r\nthe State of Qatar is innocent of all of the accusations \r\nthat have been made against it, and that it is active \r\nat the regional level in combating terrorism and \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 33/38\r\nextremism while promoting peace. We have heard \r\nsuch fake allegations only from the representatives \r\nof the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. They have \r\nnever been made by any credible international party, \r\nbut only by States whose record is full of violations of \r\ninternational law, international humanitarian law and \r\ninternational human rights law at the national, regional \r\nand international levels.\r\nSurprisingly, the States making such allegations \r\nagainst us do not practice what they preach. The \r\nEmirates and Bahrain talk about fighting terrorism \r\nand respecting the sovereignty of States and \r\nnon-interference in their affairs, while in fact they \r\nterrorize and suppress civilians, violate human rights \r\nand interfere in the internal affairs of other States in a \r\nway that undermines international and regional peace \r\nand security. That has become evident in their repeated \r\nattempts to destabilize security and stability in Qatar. \r\nThey plotted, financed and supported an unsuccessful \r\n1996 coup in Qatar, and they are currently imposing a \r\nblockade on ut. In addition, they continue to terrorize \r\ntheir citizens and keep spreading lies and expecting \r\npeople to believe them. They are also using modern \r\ntechnology in their attempts to deceive.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates was used as a platform \r\nfor financing the greatest act of terrorism in modern \r\nhistory. It allowed most of the terrorists who perpetrated \r\nthat act to escape through its territories, as was stated \r\nin the official report issued by the Commission on the \r\n11 September events that led to that terrorist attack. \r\nWhile those States claim that they are combating \r\nterrorism, we all know that it was their reckless and \r\nirresponsible policies that helped to launch terrorism. It \r\nis deplorable that our region has witnessed that kind of \r\npolitical gambling.\r\nWith regard to the allegations made about my \r\ncountry by the representative of Bahrain, I want to say \r\nthat its interference in the internal affairs of the State \r\nof Qatar reveals a real crisis of leadership in Bahrain. \r\nInstead of resolving their internal issues, it seeks to \r\nfalsify history through lies in the media. Bahrain’s \r\nrecord is full of violations and policies of suppression, \r\nfor which its citizens are paying the price. That makes \r\nit ineligible to talk about fighting terrorism and \r\nextremism or about human rights. Bahrain would do \r\nbetter to uphold international conventions and respect \r\nhuman rights. It must know for certain that it cannot \r\nsolve its domestic problems by making fake allegations \r\nabout other States.\r\nBahrain should comply with the international calls \r\nto it to stop discriminating against and marginalizing \r\nits citizens. That leads to the creation of fertile \r\nenvironments enabling extremism and terrorism to \r\nspread and causing suffering in the region. The illegal \r\nand unilateral measures taken by Bahrain against my \r\ncountry serve only to undermine regional cooperation, \r\nwhich is one of the most important pillars in our efforts \r\nto achieve stability and security and combat terrorism \r\nand extremism.\r\nIt is ironic that the United Arab Emirates is trying \r\nto market itself as a factor for stability in the region. It \r\nis no secret that the United Arab Emirates has adopted \r\nirresponsible policies aimed at undermining its sister \r\nStates and peoples while destabilizing important \r\nregional bodies such as the Gulf Cooperation Council, \r\nand disregarding international law as well as the \r\nprinciples of the Charter and of good neighbourliness.\r\nAccording to United Nations and international \r\nreports, the financial sector of the United Arab \r\nEmirates has become a safe haven for those seeking \r\nto evade financial sanctions imposed by the Security \r\nCouncil, as well as for money-laundering benefiting \r\nterrorist organizations. It is known that the United \r\nArab Emirates relies on private mercenary companies \r\nto implement its destructive agenda in the region and \r\non espionage companies to terrorize its citizens and \r\nintervene in the internal affairs of other States. It has \r\nalso become known that the United Arab Emirates \r\nviolates Security Council sanctions, as is evident in \r\nthe recent reports of the Panels of Experts established \r\npursuant to Security Council resolutions 1973 (2011), \r\nand 2140 (2014). That is the record of the United Arab \r\nEmirates at the regional and international levels.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates disregards its \r\ninternational commitments. It is spearheading efforts \r\nto destabilize security and stability in the Middle \r\nEast, Africa and beyond and has become a leader in \r\ndestabilization and destruction activities. Surprisingly, \r\nit claims that it sponsors democracy while it punishes \r\nits citizens who exercise their freedom of expression \r\nwith 15 years in prison.\r\nInternational reports have cited serious human \r\nrights violations committed by the Government of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates. The report of the Group of \r\nRegional and International Eminent Experts on Yemen \r\nhas substantiated appalling and shameful human \r\nrights violations perpetrated by United Arab Emirates \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n34/38 18-30196\r\npersonnel. In that regard, we were disgusted to read \r\nparagraph 71 of the Group’s report (A/HRC/39/43) \r\ndealing with war crimes that are unprecedented in our \r\npresent era.\r\nIn July, the International Court of Justice issued \r\na binding decision in which it approved a request by \r\nthe State of Qatar against the United Arab Emirates \r\nregarding its discrimination against Qatari nationals \r\nand its violation of the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The \r\ndecision stipulated that the United Arab Emirates must \r\nfirst guarantee the reunification of Qatari families that \r\nhave been divided as a result of measures taken by the \r\nEmirates Government; secondly, give Qatari students \r\naffected by the United Arab Emirates measures the \r\nopportunity to complete their studies in the Emirates \r\nor give them their educational records so that they can \r\ncomplete their studies elsewhere; and thirdly, allow the \r\naffected Qatari nationals to have access to the courts of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates.\r\nThat decision by our highest international judicial \r\norgan is a recognition of the legal correctness of Qatar’s \r\nposition regarding the crisis that has been fabricated \r\nagainst it. It proves the rights of Qatari nationals who \r\nhave been affected by the unilateral, coercive, illegal \r\nand discriminatory measures of the United Arab \r\nEmirates, as well as the unjust blockade imposed on \r\nQatar. The obvious question this raises is whether the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates has been respecting human rights \r\nand complying with the international conventions that \r\nit is party to.\r\nMs. Gambhir (India): This morning, my delegation \r\ncame to the Assembly to listen attentively to the new \r\nForeign Minister of Pakistan outline his vision for a \r\nnew Pakistan (see A/73/PV.14). What we heard instead \r\nwas about a new Pakistan cast in the mould of the old \r\nPakistan. I am therefore compelled to take the f loor to \r\nexercise India’s right of reply by rejecting the baseless \r\nallegations made by the Foreign Minister of Pakistan.\r\nAmong the most outrageous and preposterous \r\nwere allegations relating to the horrifying terror attack \r\non a Peshawar school four years ago. Let me remind \r\nthe new Government of Pakistan of the outpouring of \r\nsorrow and pain in India that followed that massacre \r\nof innocent children in 2014. Both houses of India’s \r\nParliament expressed solidarity while paying respect \r\nto the memory of those killed. Schools all over India \r\nobserved two minutes of silence in their memory. The \r\ndespicable insinuation made by the Foreign Minister of \r\nPakistan dishonours the memory of the innocent lives \r\nlost to terrorists that day. His was a desperate attempt to \r\nlook away from the monster of terror that Pakistan has \r\nitself created in its quest to destabilize its neighbours, \r\nwhose territory it covets. Let me make it clear to the \r\nnew Government of Pakistan that the entire State of \r\nJammu and Kashmir is and will remain an integral part \r\nof India.\r\nWe have also heard Pakistan claim that it has turned \r\nthe tide on terrorism. Let us fact-check that statement. \r\nCan Pakistan deny the fact that it has chosen to serve as \r\nhost and patron to 132 of the United Nations-designated \r\nterrorists and 22 terrorist entities sanctioned as of \r\ntoday under the sanctions regimes established pursuant \r\nto Security Council resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1988 \r\n(2011)? Will Pakistan deny that the United Nations-\r\ndesignated terrorist Hafiz Saeed is given free rein \r\ninside Pakistan to spew venom and set up candidates \r\nfor electoral offices?\r\nWe have also noted an effort on the part of the new \r\nPakistan to champion human rights. That is vintage \r\nverbal duplicity, as is evident in the recent example of \r\nPrinceton economics professor Atif Mian’s appointment \r\nto and removal from the Economic Advisory Council of \r\nPakistan on the grounds that he belongs to a minority. \r\nBefore preaching to the world, the championing of \r\nhuman rights should begin at home.\r\nWe also heard today that Pakistan supports a report \r\nthat no Member State asked for, none supported and on \r\nwhich no action was taken.\r\nThe new Foreign Minister of Pakistan chose to term \r\nIndia’s reaction to the gruesome killing of some of our \r\nsecurity personnel by Pakistani-sponsored terrorists as \r\nbased on f limsy grounds. While it may not be the case \r\nfor Pakistan, for India, every loss of life counts. Hence \r\nour belief that talks and terror cannot go together.\r\nIn conclusion, what we have heard are fake \r\nallegations and fake facts, which can only make for a \r\nfake vision. For a new vision to materialize, Pakistan \r\nmust demonstrate that it has moved beyond a narrative \r\nof deception, deceit and distortion.\r\nMs. AlMatrooshi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My country’s delegation would like to exercise \r\nits right of reply in response to the false accusations \r\nand allegations made by the representative of Qatar in \r\nhis statement.\r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 35/38\r\nIt is deplorable that as usual Qatar has chosen to \r\nengage in political manoeuvres aimed at exacerbating \r\na crisis rather than respecting its obligations under \r\ninternational law. Instead of focusing on its illegitimate \r\nattitudes, which must be addressed, and working in \r\ngood faith to settle the crisis, Qatar is trying to add \r\nan international dimension to that crisis by distorting \r\nand misrepresenting the objectives behind the justified \r\nand appropriate measures that were taken against Qatar \r\nby the United Arab Emirates, with the Kingdom of \r\nBahrain, the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia.\r\nThose measures were in response to Qatar’s \r\ndestabilizing actions over the past two decades, \r\nincluding its interference in the internal affairs of \r\nArab States and support for extremist ideologies across \r\nthe region, as well as the provision of financing and \r\nsupport to terrorist organizations. Those are not only \r\nf lagrant violations of international law, many Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and multilateral agreements, \r\nthey also constitute a serious threat to the security \r\nand stability of Arab States and many other States \r\nthroughout the world. We underscore that our measures \r\nwere taken in response to illegal activities carried out \r\nby the Qatari regime. In that regard, we stress that the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates fully respects and appreciates \r\nthe people of Qatar.\r\nIn that regard, the United Arab Emirates has \r\nestablished humanitarian exemptions so that the majority \r\nof the Qatari people are not affected by the measures \r\ntaken against the Qatari regime. The allegations made \r\nby Qatar are not based on any factual grounds.\r\nWe reject any violation of the International \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \r\nDiscrimination. We deplore the fact that Qatar has \r\nmisrepresented the decision of the International Court \r\nof Justice regarding the temporary measures. We take \r\nthis opportunity to underscore that the United Arab \r\nEmirates fully complies with the measures decided on \r\nby the International Court of Justice. We remind the \r\nState of Qatar that the Court has called on both parties \r\nto refrain from any action that might exacerbate or \r\nprolong the crisis, making resolving it more difficult.\r\nWe shall continue to implement our measures \r\nagainst Qatar until we are certain that we are not going \r\nto fall victim to its aggressive policies. Qatar must \r\nchange its attitude.\r\nMr. Hatem (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation would like to exercise its right of reply in \r\nresponse to the allegations, deceptions and inaccuracies \r\npresented by the delegation of the State of Qatar. Four \r\ncountries in the Arab Gulf region have exercised their \r\nsovereign right to boycott Qatar in order to protect their \r\nsecurity and stability and to oppose Qatar’s interference \r\nin their internal affairs.\r\nFor decades, Qatar has continued to support and \r\nfinance terrorist groups, destabilize States’ security \r\nand stability, support sectarianism and extremism, \r\nincite violence, and coordinate with terrorist groups \r\nwith the aim of overthrowing regimes. The decision by \r\nthe four States is in exercise of their sovereign right, \r\nbased on the provisions and principles of international \r\nlaw, to maintain their security and stability.\r\nQatar’s many actions are not limited to the events that \r\ntook place in Bahrain in 2011. It has supported terrorist \r\ngroups in Bahrain and elsewhere, while providing them \r\nwith financial and media support. Bahrain has put up \r\nwith Qatar’s interventions and aggressions, which have \r\nbeen documented historically and internationally. The \r\nKingdom of Bahrain has evidence demonstrating the \r\ninterference of Qatar in its internal affairs and Qatari \r\nattempts to sow chaos, threaten peace and undermine \r\nthe social fabric of our country.\r\nOne of our reasons for severing relations with Qatar \r\nis its lack of respect for the sovereignty of other States, \r\nas well as its policies targeting States’ security and \r\nits interference in their internal affairs, contradicting \r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations and \r\nprovisions of international law. Qatar has sought to \r\ndisrupt the Gulf Cooperation Council by not respecting \r\nits own obligations under the 2013 Riyadh agreement \r\nand its implementing mechanism, as well as the 2014 \r\nsupplementary agreement.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain, together with its \r\nbrothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United \r\nArab Emirates and the Arab Republic of Egypt, has \r\nurged Qatar to abide by the agreed related charters \r\nand conventions and to stop supporting and financing \r\nterrorism while providing safe haven to terrorists. \r\nHowever, Qatar has preferred to continue supporting \r\nterrorism and cooperating with Iran, the main supporter \r\nof the terrorism that targets States’ security in the Arab \r\nGulf region.\r\nThe allegations that our boycott of Qatar has caused \r\nhuman rights violations are not true. The boycotting \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n36/38 18-30196\r\nStates have committed no human rights violations. The \r\nQatari and the Gulf peoples are brothers, and our States \r\nwant to affirm that fact.\r\nQatar continues to focus on unrealistic issues and has \r\ntried to convince our Qatari brothers and international \r\npublic opinion that the boycotting States are imposing \r\nan economic blockade and violating Qatari human \r\nrights. It claims that what the four States have done is a \r\nconspiracy that oppresses Qatar. Qatar has focused its \r\nforeign policy on three issues: oppression, conspiracy \r\nand the blockade. It is Qatar that has committed grave \r\nviolations of its own citizens’ human rights. Qatar \r\nwithdrew Qatari citizenship from certain people \r\nrelated to the Goufran tribe, while violating the rights \r\nof foreign construction workers in Qatar, as stated in a \r\nreport by the United States State Department.\r\nWith regard to Qatar’s allegation that a blockade \r\nhas been imposed against it, all that the four States \r\ndid was to exercise their sovereign right to close their \r\nairspace and territorial waters. That is a sovereign right \r\nand does not constitute a blockade as claimed by Qatar. \r\nHowever, its airport and skies are open, and Qatar can \r\ncontinue to carry out import and export activities. The \r\nAmir of Qatar has stated in his speeches that Qatar \r\nis not affected economically or commercially by the \r\nboycott and that its economy continues to grow. Another \r\nstatement by the Qatari Minister of Economy notes that \r\nQatar has not been harmed by the boycott measures, that \r\nall of the items that Qatar needs are available in Qatari \r\nmarkets and that it can undertake import activities by \r\nair and sea. All of that contradicts the Qatari allegations \r\nthat there is an economic blockade and a plot against \r\nQatar. The four States have agreed to open emergency \r\nair corridors to and from Qatar in order to safeguard \r\naviation, aircraft and passengers.\r\nWhat is needed to resolve the crisis with Qatar? \r\nIt must be understood, first, that the measures taken \r\nby the four States are aimed at protecting their \r\nsecurity and stability. The core of the crisis is that \r\nQatar supports and finances extremism and terrorism. \r\nIts interference in our internal affairs must change \r\ndrastically. The four States will then be ready to engage \r\nin dialogue with Qatar, if in practice it demonstrates \r\nthe will to stop supporting and financing terrorism and \r\nextremism, disseminating hate speech and incitement \r\nand interfering in the internal affairs of the four States, \r\nin accordance with the six principles that ensure peace \r\nand stability in the region.\r\nQatar must commit to fully implementing the \r\n2013 Riyadh agreement and the 2014 supplementary \r\nagreement, as well as its implementation mechanisms. \r\nIt must also demonstrate a commitment to engaging \r\nresponsibly in dialogue with our States in the context \r\nof the Kuwaiti endeavours. The measures taken by the \r\nfour States are sovereign measures aimed at remedying \r\nQatar’s behaviour, which seeks to break up the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council, destabilize the security of States \r\nin the region, and interfere in their internal affairs, \r\nin grave violation of their sovereign rights, which are \r\nguaranteed by international law and the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Warraich (Pakistan): I am taking the f loor to \r\nexercise our right of reply to the statement just made by \r\nthe representative of India. Her diatribe was a reflection \r\nnot only of India’s deep-seated hostility towards my \r\ncountry but also of the Indian habit of conflating fact \r\nwith fabrication.\r\nWe were treated to another homily against terrorism. \r\nListening to that exposition, one might indeed marvel \r\nat the saintly behaviour of our eastern neighbour. \r\nBut who are more qualified to talk of terrorism than \r\nthose who practice it as an instrument of State policy? \r\nThe breeding ground of terrorism in our region is the \r\nfascistic Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh centres. The \r\nclaims of religious superiority are being perpetrated \r\nthrough straight patronage all across India.\r\nSpeaking of victims of terrorism, I would like to \r\nremind the Indian representative of people such as \r\nDanish Rajab, a 24-year-old man from Srinagar, whose \r\npellet-infested face was deprived of vision in the left \r\neye and who tells a story of misfortune that is not \r\nunique to him. Asif Amacher, a 10-year-old boy, seeks \r\nsimilar answers from those who took his eyesight. The \r\nIndian representative could have spoken of the agony \r\nof Farooq Ahmad Dar, who was tied to an army Jeep \r\nand driven in front of unarmed Kashmiri protesters to \r\nbe used as a human shield — or perhaps of Kasir Bhat, \r\nwho was run over and killed by a military vehicle.\r\nA country such as India — where members of \r\nminorities, including Christians and Muslims, are \r\npublicly lynched at the hands of Hindu zealots; where \r\nthe perpetrators of the Samjhauta Express attack in \r\n2007 receive State patronage; where an unabashed \r\nHindu extremist, Yogi Adityanath, who openly \r\nadvocates the religious superiority of Hindus, serves \r\nas the face of the largest Indian state, Uttar Pradesh; \r\n29/09/2018 A/73/PV.15\r\n18-30196 37/38\r\nwhere the right of Bengalis to citizenship in Assam has \r\nbeen arbitrarily rescinded, rendering them suddenly \r\nstateless and subjecting them to being called termites \r\nby a prominent Indian leader; and where churches and \r\nmosques are torched — such a country is surely not \r\nqualified to give sermons to others. In the illiberal India \r\nof today there is no room for dissent. India’s proclivity \r\nfor violence is also no secret. In the last 70 years, India \r\nhas been engaged in at least a dozen instances of the use \r\nof force against its neighbours and continues to face 17 \r\ndomestic insurgencies.\r\nAs for the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, I would \r\nurge the Indian representative to look, for once, \r\nbeyond obfuscation and denial to answer a few simple \r\nquestions honestly and objectively. Can India deny \r\nthe situation in Jammu and Kashmir, which is an \r\ninternationally recognized dispute on which there exist \r\na number of United Nations resolutions? Can India \r\ndeny that the United Nations has expressly called for \r\nholding an impartial plebiscite to ascertain the wishes \r\nof the Kashmiri people? Can India deny that more than \r\n100,000 people have been killed in Indian-occupied \r\nJammu and Kashmir, a number that is well documented \r\nby human rights organizations and the international \r\nmedia? Can India deny that Indian military forces \r\nhave resorted to the indiscriminate use of force against \r\ninnocent civilians, causing widespread death and \r\ninjury? Since the Indian occupation of Jammu and \r\nKashmir has little claim to legitimacy, the true face \r\nof the Indian occupation was exposed yet again by the \r\nrecent report of the Office of the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights, which presents a litany of systematic \r\nviolations of the fundamental human rights of the \r\nKashmiri people.\r\nAs much as India may try, credibility cannot be \r\ngained by discrediting the truth but rather by facing \r\nup to it. The truth is that Jammu and Kashmir is not \r\na part of India. It never was, and it never will be. As \r\nfor Security Council resolutions, they do not lapse with \r\ntime, nor are they overtaken by circumstance. Law has \r\nno expiration date; morality has no sell-by date.\r\nIndia cannot hide behind semantics anymore. It \r\ncan regurgitate hollow allegations against Pakistan of \r\ncross-border terrorism, but it cannot hide its egregious \r\nState terrorism against the defenceless people in \r\noccupied Kashmir. It can arrogantly silence courageous \r\nKashmiri voices such as that of Shujaat Bukhari, \r\nbut it cannot suppress the voice of the international \r\ncommunity, which was articulated in the High \r\nCommissioner’s report. It can use the might of its guns \r\nto keep innocent Kashmiris under its illegal occupation \r\nfor now, but not forever. The 100,000 Kashmiri dead in \r\noccupied Jammu and Kashmir tell an unremitting tale \r\nof India’s two-facedness. It is time for India to abandon \r\nits doublespeak. Reckless rhetoric and phony bravado \r\nmay win it an election, but they cannot win it peace, nor \r\nindeed can they earn India any credibility.\r\nMr. Al-Kuwari (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nrepeated accusations that we have heard today from \r\nthe regimes of Abu Dhabi and Bahrain are baseless, \r\nand they seek to distort the image of the State of Qatar \r\nbecause they believe that will help to undermine its \r\ninternational relations. The most eloquent response \r\nis that during the period in which Qatar has been \r\nexperiencing that unjust blockade, its international \r\npartnerships with many countries and various United \r\nNations bodies have been reinforced.\r\nThe State of Qatar has continued to strengthen its \r\nactivities and initiatives with a view to achieving, among \r\nother things, United Nations objectives in countering \r\nterrorism and extremism, promoting a culture of peace, \r\nengaging in dialogue between civilizations and faiths, \r\nencouraging education, enhancing human rights, \r\nachieving sustained peace, strengthening cybersecurity, \r\nfostering mediation and empowering youth and women.\r\nWe all know that the policies of the State of Qatar \r\nare based on its commitment to international law and \r\nto refraining from any act that could impede efforts \r\nto overcome the challenges that the international \r\ncommunity is facing. We have therefore exercised self-\r\nrestraint and made a commitment to dialogue and the \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts.\r\nOn the other hand, both of the regimes in Abu \r\nDhabi and Bahrain have continued their destabilizing \r\npolicies in the region, as well as their grave violations \r\nof human rights. They have failed to present evidence to \r\nsubstantiate their allegations against the State of Qatar, \r\ndespite calls to do so. That proves that the allegations are \r\nfallacious and that the measures based on them embody \r\nthe failure of those States to deal with differences of \r\nopinion. It further proves that their approach is based \r\non assault and incitement, false allegations and a \r\ndisregard for brotherhood and good neighbourliness as \r\nwell as the principles of friendly international relations. \r\nThat is in addition to their disregard for cooperation \r\naimed at strengthening peace, security and stability, \r\nA/73/PV.15 29/09/2018\r\n38/38 18-30196\r\nas well as human rights, development and addressing \r\ncommon challenges.\r\nIt has become evident that the attempts by the \r\nregimes in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain to target Qatar \r\nwith fabricated allegations are a continuation of the \r\nallegations that seek to justify their illegal unilateral \r\nmeasures, including a cybercrime committed by the \r\nEmirates. International and credible local entities have \r\nagreed that the regime in Abu Dhabi has committed that \r\ncrime in f lagrant violation of international law. That \r\ncomes at a time when international efforts are being \r\nintensified to combat cybercrime, which threatens \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nSince under the Assembly’s rules of procedure I \r\nwill not be able to ask for the f loor again to respond \r\nto further allegations after exercising my second right \r\nof reply, my country reserves the right to respond \r\nin writing, and I request that my response be placed \r\non record.\r\nMs. Al-Matrooshi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): I find myself obliged to respond once again \r\nto the repeated allegations made by the representative \r\nof Qatar. As we have repeatedly stated, the allegations \r\nwith regard to piracy and fabricated statements are \r\ncompletely erroneous. All four States reject the claim \r\nthat they participated in an alleged plot with regard \r\nto any cybercrime. They call on the Qatari regime to \r\nstop diverting attention from the issue at hand and to \r\nbegin to change the attitude whereby it seeks to incite \r\nterrorism in the region and beyond.\r\nWe deplore the fact that Qatar is spreading false \r\ninformation by proclaiming that the diplomatic crisis \r\nwas caused by a cyberattack. There were no such \r\nactions contributing to that escalation. Qatar has been \r\nfinancing extremist groups for the past 20 years. The \r\nregion is experiencing a period of unprecedented \r\nturbulence, and Qatar is trying to make the most of that \r\ninstability by fomenting extremism.\r\nMy country’s delegation will not waste its time by \r\nresponding to the fabrications by the Qatari regime. \r\nWe have already clarified our dispute with Qatar with \r\nour brothers in the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia and the Arab Republic of Egypt. In \r\nthat regard, I would like to note that the Qatari regime \r\nignores the positive role that the United Arab Emirates \r\nhas been playing in confronting the tremendous \r\nchallenges facing the region, some of them caused \r\nby Qatar.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.50 p.m.\r\n"
