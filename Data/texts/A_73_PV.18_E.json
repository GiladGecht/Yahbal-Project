The meeting garnered high-level \r\nparticipation and resulted in the endorsement of a \r\ncomprehensive draft political declaration (A/73/L.2)\r\nthat encompasses actions expected at the national \r\nand international levels. The meeting also included \r\na rich debate among a variety of stakeholders on \r\navenues to better prevent, control, diagnose and treat \r\nNCDs. Of course, the final objective is to achieve \r\nrelevant goals and targets set out the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nI would like to express the appreciation of the \r\nGroup to the Permanent Representatives of Uruguay \r\nand Italy and their staff for facilitating the process of \r\nconsultations on NCDs, starting from the scope and \r\nmodalities phase to the negotiations of the draft political \r\ndeclaration itself. The negotiations were not easy, but \r\nwe should all be proud of our strong commitments in \r\nthe final text.\r\nI would also like to express our gratitude to you, \r\nMadam President, along with the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session, for \r\nyour leadership in convening a successful high-level \r\nmeeting, including the very informative interactive \r\ncivil society hearings held on 5 July.\r\nFinally, we would like to congratulate ourselves \r\nand our fellow colleagues on the formal adoption of \r\nthe draft political declaration by the General Assembly \r\ntoday — in a few moments, hopefully. I would like \r\nto stress the priorities raised in the G-77 and China \r\nstatement delivered the day of the high-level meeting. It \r\nis now time for all of us to deliver the actions necessary \r\nto prevent and control NCDs.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

The draft political declaration (A/73/L.2) \r\nthat emerged from the high-level meeting is a concise \r\nand action-oriented document that calls for an \r\naccelerated response. We thank the co-facilitators, \r\nthe representatives of Italy and Uruguay, for their able \r\nleadership in the negotiations.\r\nThe European Union is pleased with the draft \r\npolitical declaration. We fully agree that more and \r\nfaster progress is needed in order to reach the agreed \r\ngoals. It is high time to act. We now need to pool all of \r\nour efforts for the implementation of the actions set out \r\nin that document. We are of course ready to do so. Let \r\nme give members of the Assembly some examples.\r\nThe eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe World Health Organization Framework Convention \r\non Tobacco Control took a key decision last week to \r\nadvance work in respect to novel tobacco products, \r\ncross-border advertising and other important issues. \r\nThe European Union is proud to have substantially \r\ncontributed to that effort.\r\nAt the European level, we work closely with our \r\nmember States, learning from each other, exchanging \r\npositive experiences and further implementing best \r\npractices. We recently established a Steering Group \r\non Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and the \r\nManagement of Non-Communicable Diseases to \r\nprovide guidance and identify best practices that can \r\nbe piloted and scaled up. For example, the Swedish best \r\npractice on general practitioners prescribing physical \r\nactivity and the Italian cardiovascular screening \r\nprogramme Cardio 50 will be shared with other member \r\nStates next year. I can also assure the Assembly that \r\nthe European Union is fully committed to realizing \r\ntarget 3.4 of the Sustainable Development Goals and to \r\nreducing premature mortality from non-communicable \r\ndiseases. \r\nNevertheless, the high-level meeting confirmed \r\nthat we have to do more, and we have to do it quickly. \r\nNon-communicable diseases are a global concern and \r\nare exacerbated by poverty. We see time and again that \r\nnon-communicable diseases are associated with health \r\ninequalities. We trust that this third high-level meeting \r\non non-communicable diseases and the resulting draft \r\npolitical declaration that we are about to adopt today can \r\ncreate further momentum. Let us grasp this opportunity, \r\nredouble our efforts to tackle the global challenge of \r\nnon-communicable diseases and epidemics and further \r\ninvest in more effective health promotion, prevention \r\nand management of non-communicable diseases. We \r\ncan expect high human and economic returns.\r\nMr. Rzheussky (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\nUnited Nations plays, and will continue to play, its \r\npart as an important tool for multilateral international \r\ncooperation, because no other international body has \r\nsuch multifaceted experiences, competencies and \r\ncoordinating potential for accomplishing global tasks. \r\nFor the United Nations to serve humankind as effectively \r\nas possible, we must strengthen the Organization, \r\nimprove our multilateral dialogue and establish a rules-\r\nbased international order that is acceptable to all.\r\nIn accordance with the Secretary-General’s \r\ninitiative, the United Nations is currently undergoing \r\nthe largest-scale reform in its history, aimed at seeking \r\ninnovative ideas and making its response to challenges \r\nand threats more nimble. While we appreciate the \r\nSecretary-General’s reforms of its development system, \r\nthe United Nations must not be associated only with \r\npen-pushing by civil servants at Headquarters but \r\nmust be understood and called for by ordinary people. \r\nWe are therefore eagerly awaiting the launch of a new \r\ngeneration of United Nations country teams, and we \r\nhope that the new status of Resident Coordinators will \r\nstrengthen States’ capacity to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) at home. \r\nAchieving the SDGs also require supporting \r\nnational efforts by ensuring favourable international \r\neconomic conditions. In that regard, it will be essential \r\nto strengthen the ability of the United Nations to \r\nestablish reliable partnerships with international and \r\nregional economic and financial institutions, in order to \r\nenhance coordination and agreements that will ensure \r\nthat our global economic regulatory mechanisms \r\nencourage the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\n10/10/2018 A/73/PV.18\r\n18-31253 3/9\r\nThe United Nations administrative system is an \r\nimportant element in the business of strengthening the \r\nOrganization, and in that context Belarus commends \r\nthe interim results of the management reforms \r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General. For the reforms \r\nto succeed, we must develop a straightforward, simple, \r\ntransparent system for delegating authority with the aim \r\nof ensuring that responsibilities and accountability are \r\ntied together. We also hope that establishing an annual \r\nbudget system will help to strengthen the capacity of \r\nthe United Nations and ensure greater f lexibility in the \r\nfinancing of its functions.\r\nThe question of the reform of the Security Council \r\nhas been a separate issue for a relatively long time. \r\nIn our view, one of the most significant achievements \r\nof Council reform would be its budget neutrality. We \r\nsupport the efforts of the States Members of the United \r\nNations to broaden the dialogue on ways to reform \r\nthe Security Council, taking into account current \r\nglobal realities and the need to adapt the Council’s \r\nconfiguration to changing conditions. In principle, \r\nwe support a broader representation in the Council of \r\nindividual regional groups, including the countries of \r\nEastern Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America and others. \r\nHowever, only a balanced, gradual and consensus-\r\nbased approach to the issues related to reform of the \r\nSecurity Council can ensure that our States’ joint \r\nefforts can succeed. The process of revising the annual \r\nreport on “Revised Elements of Commonality and \r\nIssues for Further Consideration” should not be based \r\non an arbitrary interpretation of States’ proposals. The \r\nidea of imposing non-consensus solutions that do not \r\nenjoy general support is counterproductive. Rushed or \r\nartificially imposed timetables for reaching agreements \r\nare unacceptable. Ultimately, we must keep in our \r\nsights and not forget the true goal of our joint efforts, \r\nwhich is improving the effectiveness of the Security \r\nCouncil’s work. Any attempts to substitute other short-\r\nterm or opportunistic considerations for that goal \r\nare despicable.\r\nThe microclimate within the United Nations itself \r\ncan also make a real contribution to improving the \r\neffectiveness of the Organization in combating external \r\nthreats and challenges. A dialogue between the States \r\nand the Secretariat is essential to ensure that United \r\nNations decisions are born of a joint dialogue, which \r\nunquestionably strengthens the Organization and \r\nenhances its standing in the world. As we all know, \r\nagreement at home is the recipe for success. That is the \r\nway we must all strive for agreement within the United \r\nNations so that it remains a genuine forum in which \r\nour States can work with international civil servants to \r\nfind answers to the global problems that they cannot \r\nresolve separately.\r\nMr. Condor (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I have the \r\nhonour to take the f loor to speak on behalf of the \r\n14 member States of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM).\r\nCARICOM greatly appreciates today’s forthcoming \r\nformal adoption of the draft political declaration on the \r\nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases \r\n(A/72/L.2). Having been credited with elevating the \r\nissue of non-communicable diseases on the global \r\nhealth agenda in 2011, CARICOM would like to express \r\nsincere congratulations to you, Madam President, on the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s successful third high-level meeting \r\non the prevention and control of non-communicable \r\ndiseases, at which we witnessed the commitment \r\nof national, regional and international stakeholders \r\nthrough the endorsement of a comprehensive, \r\naction-oriented draft political declaration. I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to express our appreciation \r\nto the Permanent Representatives of Italy and \r\nUruguay for their facilitation of the consultations \r\non non-communicable diseases that have led us to \r\ntoday’s adoption.\r\nFinally, we want to congratulate the wider United \r\nNations membership on today’s adoption of the draft \r\npolitical declaration. We believe that now is the time \r\nto deliver. We therefore fully commit to accelerating \r\nour response in order to address non-communicable \r\ndiseases for the health and well-being of present and \r\nfuture generations.\r\nMs. Frolova (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): Today we would like to address the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General entitled “Shifting \r\nthe management paradigm in the United Nations: \r\ncomparative assessment of human resources structures” \r\n(A/73/366), which we have studied with interest. It \r\ngives a comparative assessment of the Secretariat’s two \r\nproposed variations of the functioning of personnel \r\ndivisions. The alternatives are either to unite all of them \r\nin one department or to split them between two new, \r\nreorganized departments, one for management strategy, \r\npolicy and control and one for operational support. \r\nWe were unfortunately unable to reach a consensus \r\non this crucial aspect of management reform during \r\nA/73/PV.18 10/10/2018\r\n4/9 18-31253\r\nthe seventy-second session. In our view, any changes, \r\nif they are to be agreed by consensus, must ensure a \r\ncomprehensive approach to resolving the underlying \r\nproblems of improving and optimizing the work of the \r\nUnited Nations in the area of human resources.\r\nWe want to particularly emphasize that the \r\nreport (A/73/411) of the Advisory Committee on \r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) \r\ncontains a reference to a previous recommendation \r\nthat supported the idea of a single structure subsuming \r\nall human-resources issues. Besides that, we think it \r\nis also important to consider section IV, paragraph 4, \r\nof resolution 72/262 C along with the report on the \r\ncomparative assessment of human resources structures. \r\nIt requests that the Secretary-General submit a new \r\nproposal for the global service delivery model no \r\nlater than the first resumed part of the seventy-third \r\nsession of the Fifth Committee. The ACABQ concluded \r\nthat the new global service delivery model could \r\nhave a direct impact not only on the functioning and \r\nformation of human resources structures, but also on \r\nissues of the delegation of authority and accountability. \r\nFor our part, we are in favour of retaining all human \r\nresources functions under a single structure within \r\nthe Secretariat, for which the most appropriate choice \r\nwould be the Department of Operational Support.\r\nIn conclusion, we want to point out that the Russian \r\ndelegation is ready to work constructively on this \r\nagenda item in the Fifth Committee.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the debate on these items.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.2.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMs. De Miranda (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): This oral \r\nstatement is made in accordance with rule 153 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly.\r\nUnder the terms of paragraph 50 of the political \r\ndeclaration contained in draft resolution A/73/L.2, \r\nthe declaration requests the Secretary-General, in \r\nconsultation with Member States and in collaboration \r\nwith the World Health Organization and relevant funds, \r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies of the United \r\nNations system, to submit to the General Assembly, by \r\nthe end of 2024, for consideration by Member States, a \r\nreport on the progress achieved in the implementation \r\nof the political declaration, in preparation for a high-\r\nlevel meeting in 2025 for a comprehensive review of \r\nthe progress achieved in the prevention and control \r\nof non-communicable diseases and the promotion \r\nof mental health and well-being. With regard to the \r\nrequest for a high-level meeting in 2025 contained in \r\nparagraph 50, it is understood that all issues related \r\nto the meeting, including the dates, venue, format, \r\norganization and scope, are yet to be determined. \r\nAccordingly, in the absence of modalities for the \r\nmeeting, it is not possible at the present time to estimate \r\nthe potential cost implications of the requirements for \r\nmeetings and documentation. Upon the decision on the \r\nmodalities, format and organization of the meeting, \r\nthe Secretary-General would submit the relevant costs \r\nof such requirements in accordance with rule 153 \r\nof the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. \r\nFurthermore, the dates of the meeting will have to be \r\ndetermined in consultation with the Department for \r\nGeneral Assembly and Conference Management. \r\nAccordingly, the adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.2 will not give rise to any budgetary implications \r\nunder the programme budget for the biennium 2018-\r\n2019. \r\nA copy of this statement will be made available on \r\nthe PaperSmart portal.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now take a decision on draft resolution A/73/L.2, \r\nentitled “Political declaration of the third high-level \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and \r\ncontrol of non-communicable diseases”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.2?\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.2 was adopted \r\n(resolution 73/2).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Before giving \r\nthe f loor to speakers in explanation of position on the \r\nresolution just adopted, May I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations are limited to 10 minutes and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats. \r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Italy.\r\nMrs. Zappia (Italy): Ambassador Elbio Rosselli \r\nFrieri, the Permanent Representative of Uruguay, \r\nand I, continuing the work done by my predecessor, \r\nhad the honour to co-facilitate the negotiations \r\n10/10/2018 A/73/PV.18\r\n18-31253 5/9\r\non the political declaration of the third high-level \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly on the prevention \r\nand control of non-communicable diseases, held in \r\nNew York on 27 September. Let me congratulate \r\nyou, Madam President, on your successful leadership \r\non that occasion. In addition, on behalf of my fellow \r\nco-facilitator, I want to warmly thank all Member States \r\nfor their active and constructive engagement during the \r\nnegotiations, which enabled us to reach consensus on \r\na draft text, which was then approved during the high-\r\nlevel meeting and today is reflected in resolution 73/2, \r\nwhich we have just adopted. The result, which we can all \r\nbe proud of, is a concise, balanced and action-oriented \r\ndocument that builds on the opportunities and \r\nchallenges presented by the implementation of previous \r\ncommitments and highlights some key concrete areas \r\nof action for the achievement of target 3.4 of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, such as the importance \r\nof healthy lifestyle choices for the effective prevention \r\nof non-communicable diseases.\r\nI would like to remind the Assembly that today \r\nis World Mental Health Day, and that the declaration \r\nthat we just adopted addresses that issue extensively \r\nand concretely. While the Organization’s discussions \r\nand activities related to non-communicable diseases \r\nwill continue mostly in Geneva, we are confident that \r\nthe outcome of our efforts in New York will be able \r\nto effectively guide the action of the membership at \r\nthe international, national and local levels in the fight \r\nagainst non-communicable diseases, keeping in mind \r\nthe review of the related targets scheduled for 2025.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I would like \r\nto express my sincere thanks to Ambassador Elbio \r\nRosselli Frieri of Uruguay and Ambassador Maria \r\nAngela Zappia of Italy, the co-facilitators of the \r\ninformal consultations, who showed great ability \r\nand patience in their conduct of the discussions and \r\ncomplex negotiations on the draft of resolution 73/2. I \r\nalso want to thank all Member States for their valuable \r\ncontributions to reaching a substantive agreement on \r\nthe resolution.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda items 14, 125 and its sub-items \r\n(a) and (b), and 126.\r\nAgenda item 119 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium \r\nSummit\r\nSpecific meeting focused on development \r\n(resolution 60/265)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I have been \r\ninformed that no Member State has requested to take \r\nthe f loor under this item.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 119.\r\nAgenda item 129\r\nGlobal health and foreign policy\r\nDraft resolution (A/73/L.4)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to \r\nremind members that the debate on agenda item 129 \r\nis scheduled to be held on Thursday, 13 December, \r\nas announced in the programme of work set out in \r\ndocument A/INF/73/3.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.4.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMs. De Miranda (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): This oral statement \r\nis made in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly.\r\nUnder the terms of paragraph 53 of the draft \r\npolitical declaration contained in draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.4, the Secretary-General is requested, with the \r\nsupport of the World Health Organization, to provide a \r\nprogress report in 2020 on global and national progress, \r\nacross sectors, in accelerating efforts to achieve agreed \r\ntuberculosis goals within the context of achieving the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including \r\non the progress and implementation of the present draft \r\ndeclaration towards agreed tuberculosis goals at the \r\nnational, regional and global levels, which will serve \r\nto inform preparations for a comprehensive review by \r\nHeads of State and Government at a high-level meeting \r\nin 2023.\r\nIt is anticipated that the request in paragraph 53 \r\nfor documentation related to the progress report in \r\n2020 will constitute an addition to the documentation \r\nA/73/PV.18 10/10/2018\r\n6/9 18-31253\r\nworkload of the Department for General Assembly and \r\nConference Management of one document of 8,500 \r\nwords to be issued in all six languages. That would \r\nentail additional requirements in the amount of $26,000 \r\nfor documentation services in 2020.\r\nWith regard to the high-level meeting in 2023 \r\nreferred to in paragraph 53, it is understood that all \r\nissues related to the meeting, including the venue, \r\nformat, organization and scope, are yet to be determined. \r\nAccordingly, in the absence of modalities for the \r\nmeeting, it is not possible at the present time to estimate \r\nthe potential cost implications of the requirements for \r\nmeetings and documentation. Upon a decision on the \r\nmodalities, format and organization of the meeting, \r\nthe Secretary-General would submit the relevant costs \r\nof such requirements in accordance with rule 153 \r\nof the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. \r\nFurthermore, the dates of the meeting will have to be \r\ndetermined in consultation with the Department for \r\nGeneral Assembly and Conference Management.\r\nAccordingly, should the General Assembly adopt \r\nthe draft resolution A/73/L.4, additional requirements \r\nof $26,000 under section 2, “General Assembly and \r\nEconomic and Social Council Affairs and Conference \r\nManagement”, would be included in the proposed \r\nprogramme budget for the year 2020.\r\nCopies of this statement will be made available on \r\nthe PaperSmart portal.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now take a decision on draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.4, entitled “Political declaration of the high-\r\nlevel meeting of the General Assembly on the fight \r\nagainst tuberculosis”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.4?\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.4 was adopted \r\n(resolution 73/3)\r\nThe President: Before giving the f loor to speakers \r\nin explanation of position, may I remind delegations \r\nthat explanations are limited to 10 minutes and should \r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. El Ashmawy (Egypt): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Group of 77 (G-77) and China.\r\nAllow me, at the outset, to welcome the successful \r\nconvening of the first high-level meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on tuberculosis, which took place \r\non 26 September. The meeting garnered high-level \r\nparticipation and resulted in the endorsement of a draft \r\npolitical declaration with clear and bold commitments. \r\nThe meeting also included a rich debate with diverse \r\nstakeholders on avenues to better prevent, diagnose \r\nand treat tuberculosis (TB) in order to end TB by \r\n2030, as we all committed to in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nI would like to express the appreciation of the \r\nGroup to the Permanent Representatives of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda and Japan, as well as their staffs, for facilitating \r\nthe process of consultation on ending tuberculosis, \r\nstarting from the scoping modalities resolution through \r\nthe negotiations on the draft political declaration. The \r\nnegotiations were not easy, but we should all be proud \r\nof our strong commitments in the final text.\r\nI would also like to express our gratitude to you, \r\nMadam President, along with the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session, and \r\nthe respective teams for the leadership in convening \r\na successful high-level meeting, along with the \r\ninformative interactive civil society hearings held on \r\n4 June.\r\nFinally, we would like to congratulate ourselves \r\nand fellow colleagues for the political declaration \r\nadopted today by the General Assembly (resolution \r\n73/3). We would like to stress the priorities raised in the \r\nG-77 and China statement delivered during the high-\r\nlevel meeting. We believe it is now time for all of us to \r\ndeliver the actions set out in the political declaration in \r\norder to end TB by 2030, in accordance with the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nMr. Charwath (Austria): The European Union and \r\nits member States, on whose behalf I have the honour \r\nto speak today, welcomed the draft political declaration \r\nof the first high-level meeting on tuberculosis, held \r\non 26 September, as a concise and action-oriented \r\ndocument that calls for an accelerated response and \r\nrenewed commitment. First and foremost, I would like \r\nto congratulate the co-facilitators — the representatives \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda and Japan — for achieving \r\nconsensus on the draft declaration.\r\nWe should now concentrate all our efforts to address \r\nthe actions proposed in the declaration (resolution 73/3) \r\nand work on their implementation. In the European \r\nUnion there are countries with very low tuberculosis \r\n(TB) incidence that are close to eliminating TB and \r\n10/10/2018 A/73/PV.18\r\n18-31253 7/9\r\ncountries with high TB incidence. Many countries \r\nalso face additional challenges, including multi-drug \r\nresistance and particular vulnerabilities faced by \r\npeople infected with HIV or hepatitis. Despite recent \r\nprogress, especially in the EU, sustained efforts are \r\nneeded if Europe as a region is to meet the 2030 targets \r\nand eradicate TB.\r\nTuberculosis continues to disproportionately affect \r\nthe most vulnerable — the poor, the homeless and the \r\nsocially marginalized, including people infected with \r\nHIV. As such, health and social policies must work \r\nhand in hand and we must work to reach those most at \r\nrisk. Strengthening public health systems is paramount. \r\nWe welcome the development of national and regional \r\nTB strategies that address the challenges and capacities \r\nof each country, as well as the acceleration of plans to \r\nachieve universal health coverage. We recognize that \r\nmulti-drug-resistant TB is a global health threat.\r\nResistance to antimicrobial therapies greatly \r\nincreases the risk of death or serious complications \r\nand is associated with approximately 5.5 times higher \r\ntreatment costs. We must urgently tackle antimicrobial \r\nresistance through a one-health approach in human \r\nand animal health, while ensuring the prudent use \r\nof antibiotics. Investment in research is critical and \r\ninvolves developing effective and affordable medicines, \r\nincluding those that address drug-resistant forms of TB \r\nand child-friendly formulas.\r\nWe also need new rapid diagnostic tools. It is crucial \r\nthat we invest more in new prevention tools, such \r\nvaccines, and in applied research to increase existing \r\nand new tools for maximum impact. The European \r\nUnion’s contribution to research through our current \r\nresearch programme so far amounts to €150 million. \r\nWe will continue to invest in that area and ensure that \r\nnew tools for tuberculosis are rapidly made accessible \r\nto all.\r\nThe European Union is at the forefront of the \r\nfight against TB in partner countries. The EU and \r\nits member States are the largest contributors to the \r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. \r\nThe support of the Global Fund has led to impressive \r\nresults. During 2017, in countries where the Global \r\nFund invests, 5 million people with TB were treated \r\nand 102,000 people with drug-resistant TB went on \r\ntreatment. Consequently, we commit to supporting a \r\nsuccessful replenishment of the Global Fund in 2019.\r\nTuberculosis can affect everyone, but every \r\ncountry’s capacity to respond might vary. We must \r\napproach this epidemic from all angles — funding, \r\nresearch, prevention, treatment and education. We need \r\nto increase solidarity with the vulnerable among us. In \r\nthat regard, the European Union is contributing with \r\nalmost €2 million in the early detection and integrated \r\nmanagement of tuberculosis in Europe for irregular \r\nresidence and people who inject drugs. The European \r\nUnion will continue to support action to address \r\ntuberculosis at home, in the European neighbourhood \r\nand globally, while using the financial, technical and \r\npolitical instruments available to it.\r\nMr. Srivihok (Thailand): Thailand fully endorses \r\nand welcomes the adoption of the political declaration \r\nof the first-ever high-level meeting on the fight against \r\ntuberculosis (resolution 73/3). It is our hope that the \r\npolitical declaration will serve to scale up our efforts to \r\nfurther reach out the ones left behind.\r\nThailand also wishes to express its appreciation \r\nto Ambassador Webson, Permanent Representative \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda, and Ambassador Bessho, \r\nPermanent Representative of Japan, as co-facilitators of \r\nthis very important process. It was a challenging task, \r\nbut indeed a successful one. The same appreciation \r\nalso goes to Ambassador Cardi, former Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Italy, Ambassador Rosselli Frieri, \r\nPermanent Representative of Uruguay, as well as \r\nAmbassador Rattray, Permanent Representative \r\nof Jamaica, for their stewardship of the process on \r\nnon-communicable diseases.\r\nOur work does not end here, rather it is only a \r\npush from where we began three years ago. Thailand \r\nis strongly committed to achieving Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 3 and all other Goals. We also \r\neagerly look forward to the high-level meeting on \r\nuniversal health coverage to be held next year, where \r\nmembers can be sure of our constructive role. Universal \r\nhealth coverage is something we appreciate, as it is \r\ntruly the key to good health and well-being for all.\r\nMs. Bhengu (South Africa): South Africa wishes to \r\ncongratulate you, Madam President, on the successful \r\nconvening of the historic high-level meeting on the fight \r\nagainst tuberculosis (TB). Equally, we wish to thank \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Japan and Antigua \r\nand Barbuda for facilitating the entire process.\r\nTuberculosis is not just a medical condition, it \r\nhas many social determinants. They include poverty, \r\nA/73/PV.18 10/10/2018\r\n8/9 18-31253\r\nunemployment, poor nutrition, overcrowding and social \r\nstigma, which fuel the spread of diseases. That means \r\nthat the poor and marginalized carry a disproportionate \r\ndisease burden. Africa bears a significant burden of \r\ndisease related to TB, in Southern Africa in particular, \r\nand it is fuelled by the HIV epidemic.\r\nLinked to the antimicrobial resistance global \r\nproblem is the threat and seriousness of multi-drug-\r\nresistant TB, which will exacerbate the high incidence, \r\nprevalence and related mortality per capita in Africa. \r\nDespite the strides made by the South African \r\nGovernment, drug-resistant TB remains the leading \r\ncause of death in our country, especially among HIV-\r\npositive patients. It is for that reason that South Africa \r\njoins and welcomes the adoption of resolution 73/3, \r\nwhich comprehensively addresses the challenge.\r\nWe see this as a historic opportunity to generate \r\neffective change and offer a concrete way forward. \r\nBut this is only the beginning. We need to intensify \r\nour efforts at the national, regional and global levels, \r\nwith accountability at the core at all levels. Investing in \r\nresearch and development is critical if we are to develop \r\nnew diagnostics, vaccines and medicines and find \r\ninnovative ways to deal with the social determinants of \r\ntuberculosis and its transmission.\r\nTo succeed, we need to ensure that drugs are \r\naffordable. Therefore, the principle of delinkage as \r\nagreed in the political declaration of the high-level \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly on antimicrobial \r\nresistance is essential. We must adhere to the World \r\nTrade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related \r\nAspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) as \r\nwell as to the 2001 Doha Declaration on the TRIPS \r\nAgreement and Public Health, which recognizes that \r\nintellectual property rights should be interpreted in a \r\nmanner that supports public health and promotes access \r\nto medicine for all.\r\nPlease be assured of our commitment to ensuring \r\nthat we do everything possible to end tuberculosis as a \r\npublic health threat by 2030, if not earlier.\r\nMr. Bessho (Japan): On behalf of His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Alfonso Webson, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Antigua and Barbuda, and myself \r\nas co-facilitators of the high-level meeting on the \r\nfight against tuberculosis (TB), I would like to express \r\nsincere appreciation to all the Member States and \r\nobservers for the commitment and spirit of f lexibility \r\nexhibited while we jointly worked to draft the first \r\never political declaration (resolution 73/3) by the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the fight against tuberculosis. \r\nThanks to their constructive engagement, we were \r\nable to agree on a strong groundbreaking declaration, \r\nwhich was endorsed unanimously by Heads of State \r\nand Government and Ministers during the high-level \r\nmeeting convened on 26 September and formally \r\nadopted by consensus today.\r\nWe would like to thank you, Madam President, \r\nand the President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy second session, the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly, the Office of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on \r\nTuberculosis, the World Health Organization and other \r\nkey partners, notably the Global TB Caucus and the Stop \r\nTB Partnership, for their strong support and assistance.\r\nAs we prepared for the negotiations on the final \r\ndocument while building on the Moscow Declaration \r\non Tuberculosis, we were able to listen to the voices \r\nof many stakeholders, including, most important, those \r\nof TB survivors and their families and supporters. \r\nThe process included mission briefings, civil society \r\nhearings organized by the President of the General \r\nAssembly and bilateral meetings — all of which \r\nprofoundly enriched the consultations concerning the \r\npolitical declaration.\r\nThis first-ever political declaration on tuberculosis \r\nby the General Assembly includes some key \r\ncommitments: treatment target figures of 40 million \r\npeople and preventive treatment target figures of \r\n40 million people, commitments to mobilizing \r\n$13 billion for tuberculosis response, as well as \r\n$2 billion for research and development. The declaration \r\nalso highlights important issues in the fight against \r\ntuberculosis, including special attention to children \r\nand vulnerable populations, gender and human rights, \r\naccess to affordable medicines, resilient health systems \r\nand incentives to research and development.\r\nIn order to measure our progress, the declaration \r\nrequests the Secretary-General to prepare a progress \r\nreport in 2020 and to convene a high-level review meeting \r\nin 2023. It also highlights important linkages to HIV/\r\nAIDS and in microbial resistance, non-communicable \r\ndiseases and, most notably, universal health coverage. \r\nWe must now implement the commitments made \r\nby our leaders to end tuberculosis. Member States \r\nwill convene the high-level meeting on universal \r\nhealth coverage next September. We must capitalize \r\n10/10/2018 A/73/PV.18\r\n18-31253 9/9\r\non this opportunity to accelerate our efforts to end \r\ntuberculosis in a way that synergizes with our efforts \r\nto address both communicable and non-communicable \r\ndiseases, thereby contributing to the achievement of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals.\r\nAs part of our contribution, Japan will convene \r\na series of relevant meetings next year, including \r\nthe Summit of the Group of 20 in Osaka and the \r\nseventh Tokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment, which will promote our collective efforts \r\nin those areas. Let us also work together to make next \r\nyear’s high-level meeting on universal health coverage \r\nan important milestone in following through on our \r\npledge to end tuberculosis so that no one will be left \r\nbehind from the highest attainable health, which \r\neveryone deserves.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in explanation of position.\r\nI would like to express my sincere thanks to \r\nAmbassador Walton Alfonso Webson of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda and Ambassador Koro Bessho of Japan, who \r\nserved as co-facilitators of the informal consultations \r\nand demonstrated great skill and patience in \r\nconducting the deliberations and complex negotiations \r\non resolution 73/3, which, as has been said, is a historic \r\nresolution — the first General Assembly resolution \r\non tuberculosis. I would also like to commend the \r\ninvolvement and commitment of the civil society \r\norganizations whose purpose and objective is the \r\nfight against tuberculosis. I also thank Member \r\nStates for their valuable contributions, f lexibility and \r\ncommitment in reaching agreement on the resolution.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded the present stage \r\nof its consideration of agenda item 129.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11 a.m.\r\n"
