Therefore, if there is no proposal under \r\nrule 66 of the rules of procedure, may I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly decides not to discuss the report of \r\nthe Fifth Committee that is before the Assembly today?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Before we \r\nbegin to take action on the recommendation contained \r\nin the report of the Fifth Committee, I would like to \r\nadvise representatives that we are going to proceed to \r\ntake a decision in the same manner as was done in the \r\nFifth Committee.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft \r\nresolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in \r\nparagraph 6 of its report. The Fifth Committee adopted \r\nthe draft resolution, entitled “Scale of assessments \r\nfor the apportionment of the expenses of the United \r\nNations: requests under Article 19 of the Charter”, \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 73/4).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda item 140.\r\nAgenda item 116\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and \r\nother elections\r\n(d) Election of members of the Human Rights Council\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The General \r\nAssembly will now proceed with the election of 18 \r\nmembers of the Human Rights Council to replace \r\nthose members whose term of office expires on \r\n31 December 2018.\r\nThe 18 outgoing members are the following: \r\nBelgium, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Ecuador, Ethiopia, \r\nGeorgia, Germany, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, \r\nPanama, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, \r\nSlovenia, Switzerland, Togo, the United Arab Emirates \r\nand the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 7 of resolution \r\n60/251 of 15 March 2006, these Member States are \r\neligible for immediate re-election except those that have \r\nserved two consecutive terms, namely, Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nEthiopia, Germany, Kenya, the Republic of Korea, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates and the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela.\r\nThe 18 vacant seats should be distributed among \r\nthe regional groups as follows: five seats for the African \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

The members of \r\nthe Council shall be elected directly and individually, \r\nby secret ballot, by the majority of the members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Accordingly, 97 votes constitute \r\na majority in the General Assembly, which has a \r\nmembership of 193 States.\r\nThe following States will continue to be members \r\nof the Human Rights Council: Afghanistan, Angola, \r\nAustralia, Brazil, Chile, China, Croatia, Cuba, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Hungary, \r\nIceland, Iraq, Japan, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, \r\nPeru, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovakia, \r\nSouth Africa, Spain, Tunisia, Ukraine and the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

For this election, rules 92 and 94 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly shall be applied.\r\nConsistent with the practice of the General \r\nAssembly, if more than the required number of Member \r\nStates has obtained the votes of the majority of the \r\nmembers of the Assembly on the same ballot, those \r\nMember States that have obtained the largest number \r\nof votes above the required majority will be considered \r\nelected, up to the number of seats to be filled. Also, \r\nconsistent with past practice, when, in the case of a tied \r\nvote, it becomes necessary to determine the candidate \r\nto be elected or that will proceed to the next round of \r\nrestricted balloting, there will be a special restricted \r\nballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an \r\nequal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthese procedures?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Regarding the \r\ncandidatures of the respective regional Groups, the \r\nSecretariat has been informed that, for the five vacant \r\nseats for African States, the Group has endorsed five \r\ncandidates: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Eritrea, Somalia \r\nand Togo.\r\nFor the five vacant seats for Asia-Pacific States, \r\nthe Secretariat has received communications from five \r\ncandidates: Bahrain, Bangladesh, Fiji, India and the \r\nPhilippines.\r\nFor the two vacant seats for Eastern European \r\nStates, the Secretariat has received communications \r\nfrom two candidates: Bulgaria and the Czech Republic.\r\nFor the three vacant seats for Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States, the Secretariat has received \r\ncommunications from three candidates: Argentina, the \r\nBahamas and Uruguay.\r\nFor the three vacant seats for Western European \r\nand other States, the Secretariat has received \r\ncommunications from three candidates: Austria, \r\nDenmark and Italy.\r\nI have been informed by the Secretariat that \r\nvoluntary pledges and commitments made by Member \r\nStates, in accordance with paragraph 8 of resolution \r\n60/251, were accordingly issued as official documents \r\nof the seventy-third session.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order \r\non the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot \r\npapers will be given only to the representative seated \r\ndirectly behind the country’s nameplate.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” \r\nwill now be distributed. Each ballot paper is assigned to \r\none of the five regional groups. I request representatives \r\nto use only these ballot papers.\r\nIn accordance with resolution 71/323 of \r\n8 September 2017, the names of the States that have \r\nbeen communicated to the Secretariat, at least 48 hours \r\nprior to the election today, have been printed on the \r\n12/10/2018 A/73/PV.19\r\n18-31768 3/4\r\nballot papers for each of the regional groups. Also, \r\nadditional blank lines corresponding to the number of \r\nvacant seats to be filled for each of the regional groups \r\nhave been provided on the ballot papers for inscribing \r\nother names as necessary.\r\nRepresentatives are requested to check the boxes \r\nnext to the names of candidates that are printed on \r\nthe ballot papers and/or write other eligible names on \r\nthe blank lines. The total number of checked boxes \r\nand handwritten names may not exceed the number \r\nof vacant seats to be filled as indicated on the ballot \r\npaper. A ballot paper containing more votes than the \r\nnumber of vacant seats indicated on the ballot paper \r\nwill be declared invalid. A ballot will also be declared \r\ninvalid if all the votes on that ballot do not belong to the \r\nrelevant region.\r\nAccordingly, for the ballot paper marked “A”, for \r\nAfrican States, the total number of checked boxes and \r\nhandwritten names should not exceed five candidates; \r\nfor the ballot paper marked “B”, for Asia-Pacific States, \r\nthe total number of checked boxes and handwritten \r\nnames should not exceed five candidates; for the ballot \r\npaper marked “C”, for Eastern European States, the \r\ntotal number of checked boxes and handwritten names \r\nshould not exceed two candidates; for the ballot paper \r\nmarked “D”, for Latin American and Caribbean States, \r\nthe total number of checked boxes and handwritten \r\nnames should not exceed three candidates; and for the \r\nballot papers marked “E”, for Western European and \r\nother States, the total number of checked boxes and \r\nhandwritten names should not exceed three candidates.\r\nIf a ballot paper contains one of the following \r\nnames of Member States, the ballot remains valid but \r\nthe vote for these Member States will not be counted: \r\nnames of Member States that do not belong to the region \r\nconcerned; names of Member States that are not eligible \r\nfor re-election; and names of Member States that will \r\ncontinue to be members of the Council next year.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Karem \r\n(Iraq), Mr. Asuta (Kenya), Ms. Fareena (Maldives), \r\nMs. Velazquez Gamarra (Paraguay), Mr. Correia \r\nCamilo (Portugal) and Mrs. Nipomici (Republic of \r\nMoldova) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.35 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.50 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows:\r\nGroup A — African States (5 seats)\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  193\r\nAbstentions:  1\r\nNumber of members voting:  192\r\nRequired absolute majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBurkina Faso  183\r\nTogo  181\r\nCameroon  176\r\nSomalia  170\r\nEritrea  160\r\nGroup B — Asia-Pacific States (5 seats)\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  193\r\nAbstentions:  1\r\nNumber of members voting:  192\r\nRequired absolute majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nIndia  188\r\nFiji  187\r\nBangladesh  178\r\nBahrain  165\r\nPhilippines  165\r\nGroup C — Eastern European States (2 seats)\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  193\r\nAbstentions:  5\r\nNumber of members voting:  188\r\nRequired absolute majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBulgaria  180\r\nCzech Republic  178\r\nGroup D — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(3 seats)\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 193\r\nAbstentions: 4\r\nNumber of members voting: 189\r\nRequired absolute majority: 97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBahamas 180\r\nA/73/PV.19 12/10/2018\r\n4/4 18-31768\r\nUruguay 177\r\nArgentina 172\r\nGroup E — Western European and other States \r\n(3 seats)\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  193\r\nAbstentions:  4\r\nNumber of members voting:  189\r\nRequired absolute majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nItaly  180\r\nAustria  171\r\nDenmark  167\r\nUnited States of America  1\r\nHaving obtained the required majority and the \r\nlargest number of votes of the members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the following 18 States were \r\nelected members of the Human Rights Council for \r\na three-year term of office beginning on 1 January \r\n2019: Argentina, Austria, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, \r\nthe Czech Republic, Denmark, Eritrea, Fiji, India, \r\nItaly, the Philippines, Somalia, Togo and Uruguay.\r\nThe President: I congratulate those States that \r\nhave been elected members of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, and I thank the tellers for their assistance in \r\nthis election.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded its consideration \r\nof sub-item (d) of agenda item 116.\r\nAnnouncement by the President\r\nThe President: I wish to make an announcement \r\nconcerning the membership of the General Committee \r\nof the seventy-third session of the General Assembly. \r\nMembers will recall that for the seventy-third \r\nsession, the President, the twenty-one Vice-Presidents \r\nand the Chairs of the six Main Committees were elected \r\non 5 June 2018.
