"United Nations A/73/PV.20\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n20th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 16 October 2018, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 125 (continued)\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nDraft resolution (A/73/L.5)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nf loor to the representative of Egypt to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.5.\r\nMr. Edrees (Egypt): Since its inception, the \r\nGroup of 77 (G-77) and China has been championing \r\nmultilateralism and global solidarity, as they are among \r\nthe key means for fostering cooperative and harmonious \r\nrelations towards the achievement of equity, equality \r\nand prosperity for all. On that basis, we have strived to \r\npromote the collective economic interests of developing \r\ncountries and enhance their joint negotiating capacity \r\non all major international economic and development \r\nissues within the United Nations system, and we have \r\neffectively contributed to international cooperation on \r\nthose issues, of which there are many.\r\nAs we have stressed before, the legacy of the Group \r\nof 77 and China is inextricable from that of the United \r\nNations. It would be no exaggeration to state and remind \r\nourselves that so much of what the United Nations has \r\nachieved in the past half-century in the development \r\nsphere has been in one way or another inspired, founded, \r\nshaped and supported towards fruition through the \r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nOn 27 September, the Group of 77 and China elected \r\nthe State of Palestine as Chair of the Group for the year \r\n2019, following the endorsement by the Group of Asia-\r\nPacific States of its candidature in November 2017. \r\nWhile the State of Palestine has been a full-f ledged \r\nmember of the Group of 77 and China since January \r\n1976, Palestine remains a non-member observer State of \r\nthe United Nations. Therefore, the rights and privileges \r\nenjoyed by the State of Palestine vary from one United \r\nNations organ to another, based Organizationn the \r\nrespective rules of procedure, the resolutions adopted \r\nby those organs and their established practices.\r\nIn that context, following consultations with \r\nthe Secretariat, it has been assessed that a General \r\nAssembly resolution would be required to avail the \r\nState of Palestine with the rights and capacity required \r\nto be able to perform the functions and usual practices \r\nundertaken by the Chair of the G-77 and China in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, other organs, entities and certain \r\nconferences for the duration of its chairmanship of \r\nthe G-77 and China in the year 2019, thereby enabling \r\nits effective chairmanship and the continuity of the \r\npositive role played by the Group within the United \r\nNations system.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China therefore introduces \r\ntoday draft resolution A/73/L.5, entitled “Chair of \r\nthe Group of 77 for 2019”. The rights I mentioned are \r\nenumerated in the annex of that document. The adoption \r\nof this draft resolution, which we consider to be \r\ntechnical and procedural in nature, will enable the next \r\nChair of the Group to effectively fulfil its duties and \r\nresponsibilities to the Group and the wider membership \r\nduring the year 2019, without prejudice to the existing \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n18-31786 (E)\r\n*1831786*\r\n \r\nA/73/PV.20 16/10/2018\r\n2/4 18-31786\r\nrights and privileges of the State of Palestine as per the \r\nrelevant resolutions.\r\nOn behalf of the G-77 and China, I invite all Member \r\nStates to positively consider the draft resolution now \r\nbefore them, taking into consideration its technical \r\nnature but also its importance to the work of the Group, \r\nand also noting that Egypt, in its capacity as Chair of \r\nthe Group, and the State of Palestine were engaged \r\nin the process in full transparency within the Group \r\nand the wider membership, with a view to enabling \r\na smooth transition and the continued efficacy of the \r\nGroup’s work in the coming year.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The General \r\nAssembly will now consider draft resolution A/73/L.5.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in explanation \r\nof vote before the voting, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations are limited to 10 minutes and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Cohen (United States of America): For decades, \r\nthe United States has been committed to achieving a \r\ncomprehensive end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \r\nOnly through direct negotiations between the parties \r\ncan the Israelis and the Palestinians achieve the peace \r\nthat they both deserve, which remains our goal today. \r\nWe cannot support the efforts of the Palestinians to \r\nenhance their status outside of direct negotiations. \r\nThe United States does not recognize that there is a \r\nPalestinian State and notes that no such State has been \r\nadmitted as a State Member of the United Nations. We \r\ntherefore strongly oppose the election of Palestine as \r\nChair of the Group of 77 (G-77), as well as the so-called \r\nenabling draft resolution (A/73/L.5).\r\nIf that misguided draft resolution is adopted, the \r\nUnited States will leave no doubt about where it stands. \r\nWhen the Palestinians speak as Chair of the G-77 in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, we will remind our fellow Member \r\nStates that the United States does not recognize that \r\nthere is a Palestinian State and that no such State has \r\nbeen admitted as a State Member of the United Nations. \r\nOnly States Members of the United Nations should be \r\nentitled to speak and act on behalf of major groups of \r\nStates — such as the Group of 77 and China — at the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIt is entirely inappropriate for an observer State to \r\nplay the role of representing a group of States in the \r\nGeneral Assembly or elsewhere in the United Nations \r\nsystem. The United States has long opposed the \r\nenhancements of the Palestinian status at the United \r\nNations. We voted against resolution 67/19, designating \r\nthe Palestinian delegation as a non-member observer \r\nState. We have consistently and formally objected to \r\nPalestinian accession to treaties to which we are party. \r\nThat is because, as I have already said, the United \r\nStates does not recognize that there is a Palestinian \r\nState and we do not consider ourselves to be in a treaty \r\nrelationship with the “State of Palestine”.\r\nAchieving real peace requires the courage to \r\nsit down at the table and make compromises. This \r\ninitiative does the opposite of that. We therefore ask \r\nthat all delegations vote against this draft resolution. \r\nWe also urge Palestinian leaders to do the right thing \r\nfor their people and re-engage in peace talks. When \r\nthey are ready, rest assured that the United States will \r\nbe ready too.\r\nMrs. Furman (Israel): The Group of 77 (G-77) is \r\nan important player in the development work here at the \r\nUnited Nations. It handles issues that are of the utmost \r\nimportance to us all, especially now as the United \r\nNations and Member States engage in development \r\nreform. It should be a matter of concern for everyone \r\nif the Group is exploited for non-development issues \r\nand is used to advance the political interests of one \r\ndelegation. The draft resolution before us (A/73/L.5), \r\nas drafted, makes it clear that that is indeed the case. \r\nDespite the claim that this is a G-77 draft resolution that \r\nis technical in nature, it was drafted by the Palestinian \r\ndelegation and goes beyond what is necessary for the \r\nChair to execute its functions on behalf of the Group. \r\nUnfortunately, that pattern of manipulative behaviour \r\nis not new.\r\nThe established rules of procedure of the United \r\nNations are important and set the framework in which \r\nwe conduct our business. Constant attempts to change \r\nthe rules of procedure to accommodate one observer \r\ndelegation in a manner that would not be tolerated for \r\nany Member State only weakens this institution. How \r\nironic is it that this draft resolution is being considered \r\nunder the agenda item entitled “Strengthening of the \r\nUnited Nations system”, when it clearly weakens and \r\nundermines the United Nations? We will therefore vote \r\nagainst the draft resolution. Looking towards 2019, \r\nwe sincerely hope that the same professional manner \r\nin which the current Chair handled the coordination \r\nand deliberations of the G-77 will be maintained and \r\nthat the Group will not be used cynically to score \r\npolitical points.\r\n16/10/2018 A/73/PV.20\r\n18-31786 3/4\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.5, entitled “Chair of the Group of 77 \r\nfor 2019”.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Antigua \r\nand Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, \r\nBahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, \r\nBelarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia \r\n(Plurinational State of), Botswana, Brazil, Brunei \r\nDarussalam, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, \r\nCambodia, Central African Republic, Chad, \r\nChile, China, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, \r\nCuba, Cyprus, Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, Denmark, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, \r\nEcuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Eritrea, Estonia, \r\nEswatini, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Gambia, \r\nGermany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guinea, \r\nGuyana, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic \r\nRepublic of), Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, \r\nJordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic, Lebanon, \r\nLibya, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malawi, \r\nMalaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, \r\nMauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, \r\nMorocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, \r\nNepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, \r\nNiger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, \r\nParaguay, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, \r\nRepublic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Saudi \r\nArabia, Senegal, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, \r\nSlovenia, South Africa, South Sudan, Spain, Sri \r\nLanka, Sudan, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, \r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-\r\nLeste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, \r\nTurkey, Turkmenistan, Uganda, United Arab \r\nEmirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland, United Republic of Tanzania, \r\nUruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela (Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of), Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nAustralia, Israel, United States of America\r\nAbstaining:\r\nAndorra, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nBulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, \r\nHonduras, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Monaco, \r\nPoland, Slovakia, Tuvalu\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.5 was adopted by 146 votes \r\nto 3, with 15 abstentions (resolution 73/5).\r\n[Subsequently, the delegation of Seychelles \r\ninformed the Secretariat that it had intended to vote \r\nin favour.]\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Before giving \r\nthe f loor to speakers in explanation of vote after the \r\nvoting, may I remind delegations that explanations are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations \r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMr. Schulz (Germany): Germany voted in favour \r\nof resolution 73/5 in order to enable the Palestinian \r\nChair of the Group of 77 to carry out its responsibilities \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We welcome \r\nthe fact that the resolution limits additional rights and \r\nprivileges to the duration of the Palestinian Chair’s role \r\nin 2019 and to functions required to carry out that role. \r\nWith reference to our explanation of vote on resolution \r\n67/19, entitled “Status of Palestine in the United \r\nNations” of 29 November 2012 (see A/67/PV.44), our \r\nvote today should not be construed as recognition of a \r\nState of Palestine. It should also not be construed as a \r\nstatement on its status in the United Nations. We look \r\nforward to working closely with a Palestinian Chair of \r\nthe Group of 77 in 2019.\r\nMrs. Gregoire Van Haaren (Netherlands): The \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands voted in favour of resolution \r\n73/5, on the Palestinian leadership of the Group of 77, \r\nin order to enable the Palestinian delegation to carry \r\nout its responsibilities as Chair of the Group of 77. We \r\nwelcome the fact that the resolution is limited in time to \r\nthe duration of the Palestinian leadership of the Group of \r\n77 and limited in scope to only the functions necessary \r\nto carry out that role. With reference to our statement \r\nof 29 November 2012 (see A/67/PV.44) in respect to \r\nresolution 67/19, our vote should not be construed as \r\nrecognition of a State of Palestine by the Kingdom of \r\nthe Netherlands. We look forward to cooperating with \r\nthe Group of 77 and its chairmanship in an open and \r\nconstructive way and in the spirit of this resolution.\r\nMr. Bird (Australia): Australia’s decision to vote \r\nagainst resolution 73/5 reflects its long-standing position \r\nA/73/PV.20 16/10/2018\r\n4/4 18-31786\r\nthat Palestinian attempts to seek recognition as a State \r\nin international forums are deeply unhelpful to efforts \r\ntowards a two-State solution. Unilateral recognition of \r\nPalestinian statehood will not resolve outstanding issues \r\nor create the conditions for enduring stability. That will \r\nbe realized only from a directly negotiated agreement \r\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians. Australia remains \r\nfirmly committed to a two-State solution that allows \r\nIsrael and a future Palestinian State to exist side by side \r\nin peace and security within internationally recognized \r\nborders. We urge all parties to take the courageous \r\ndecisions needed to return to, and make progress in, \r\nnegotiations. It is critical that no party seek to exploit \r\nthe outcome of today’s voting in ways that could further \r\nundermine prospects for a just and lasting settlement.\r\nMr. Allen (United Kingdom): The United Kingdom \r\nwelcomes the fact that resolution 73/5 is limited in time \r\nto the duration of the Palestinian leadership of the \r\nGroup of 77 (G-77) and limited in scope to the functions \r\nnecessary to carry out that role. For those reasons, we \r\nvoted in favour. Our vote today is to enable the effective \r\nPalestinian chairmanship of the G-77 and should not \r\nbe misconstrued as recognition of a Palestinian State. \r\nWe reserve the right to recognize a Palestinian State \r\nbilaterally at a time when it best serves the objective of \r\npeace. Ultimately, the only way to give the Palestinian \r\npeople the State that they need and deserve and give the \r\nIsraeli people the security and peace to which they are \r\nentitled is through a negotiated two-State solution.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in explanation of vote after the voting.\r\nI now give the f loor to the observer of the Observer \r\nState of Palestine.\r\nMr. Mansour (Palestine): At the outset, allow \r\nus to express our appreciation to all those who voted \r\nin favour of resolution 73/5. There were 146 votes in \r\nfavour and three against. The voting today represents \r\nmultilateralism at its best, with the broader membership \r\nsupporting a resolution to enable the elected Chair \r\nof a group to perform its duties effectively. It is an \r\nexpression of respect for the decision of the Group of 77 \r\nand China to elect the State of Palestine as its Chair for \r\nthe year 2019 by acclamation, following the consensus \r\nendorsement by the Group of Asia-Pacific States of the \r\nState of Palestine’s candidature.\r\nThe State of Palestine will spare no effort to prove \r\nitself worthy of that trust in its capacity to represent \r\nand defend the interests of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, while also engaging constructively and in an \r\ninclusive and transparent manner with all partners in \r\norder to advance cooperation and mutually beneficial \r\nagreements, for the common good of humankind.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker on this item.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 125.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.30 p.m.\r\n"
