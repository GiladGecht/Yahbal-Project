"United Nations A/73/PV.23\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n23rd plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 19 October 2018, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 68 and 13\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support\r\n(a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and \r\ninternational support\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/73/269 and \r\nA/73/270)\r\n(b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/73/273)\r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa\r\nThe President: It is a great pleasure to join \r\nmembers today. Allow me to thank those members \r\nwho participated over the course of the three-day \r\n2018 Africa Dialogue Series. I am informed that \r\nmany pertinent and invaluable points have emerged \r\nfrom the proceedings, which I believe underscores the \r\nimportance of that dialogue. It is particularly reassuring \r\nthat the partnership between the United Nations and \r\nthe African Union is seen as being stronger than at any \r\nother time in history. That is good for Africa. It is also \r\ngood for the world. We can all benefit from that lesson \r\nas we work to strengthen multilateralism.\r\nIn that connection, the implementation of the \r\nJoint United Nations-African Union Framework for \r\nan Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security and \r\nthe African Union-United Nations Framework for the \r\nImplementation of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development requires the continuing \r\nsupport of the international community. Africa also \r\ncontinues to be a leader in other areas. I commend \r\nthe fact that Africa has more women in peacekeeping \r\nmissions than any other region. Approximately 64 per \r\ncent of female peacekeepers come from Africa. That is \r\nin addition to the fact that Africa already contributes \r\nnearly half of all peacekeepers. In that regard, I would \r\nalso like to echo other colleagues and the international \r\ncommunity in commending Ethiopia on achieving \r\ngender parity in its Cabinet. It has joined a select few \r\ncountries that have achieved that ratio. Likewise, I must \r\nacknowledge our newest Nobel laureates — Mr. Denis \r\nMukwege of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nMs. Nadia Murad of Iraq — who have worked tirelessly \r\nto help end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of \r\nwar and armed conflict. That is remarkable, and we \r\nthank them for their commitment.\r\nWe are here today to reflect on the three reports \r\nof the Secretary-General submitted to the General \r\nAssembly on agenda item 68, entitled “New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development: progress in implementation \r\nand international support” (A/73/269, A/73/270 and \r\nA/73/273). I commend the Secretary-General for the \r\nquality of the reports before us. Allow me to make two \r\nvery quick points.\r\nFirst, I am pleased to see that the report (A/73/269) \r\non the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) notes that African countries continue to make \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n18-32548 (E)\r\n*1832548*\r\n \r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n2/28 18-32548\r\nprogress on the implementation of each of NEPAD’s \r\npriority areas. The programme for infrastructure \r\ndevelopment in Africa, for instance, is addressing the \r\ninfrastructure deficit on the continent. The interregional \r\nhighways, one of the most ambitious infrastructure \r\nprojects, will help to link Ethiopia, Kenya and South \r\nSudan. That physical integration is being mirrored \r\nthrough trade policy. The establishment of the African \r\nContinental Free Trade Area, for example, represents \r\na crucial step towards the creation of a single African \r\nmarket. Finally, progress towards the implementation \r\nof the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme (CAADP) opens up a vast horizon of \r\nopportunities for the transformation of the continent. In \r\nthat context, I note how closely that initiative is linked \r\nto the decent-work priority of the seventy-third session \r\nof the General Assembly. In the case of Africa, the huge \r\nyouth population alone makes progress on the CAADP \r\na necessity. Each of those developments points to major \r\nshifts forward towards the African Union’s vision for \r\nan integrated, peaceful and prosperous Africa.\r\nHowever, my second point is that greater support is \r\nneeded, in my view, to accelerate and sustain progress. \r\nCommitments to official development assistance \r\nand other financing, including financing for indirect \r\ninvestment, technology transfer, capacity-building and \r\nmarket access, must be fulfilled in the spirit of true \r\npartnership. African countries, the regional economic \r\ncommunities and the African Union have made great \r\nstrides in building African capacities to tackle threats \r\nto peace and security. In order to support those efforts, \r\nthere should be adequate, predictable and sustained \r\nfinancing for African Union-led peace operations \r\nauthorized by the Security Council.\r\nAfrica is at the heart of everything that we do at \r\nUnited Nations. We cannot succeed elsewhere if we \r\nhave not succeeded in Africa.\r\nMr. Hilale (Morocco): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of the Group of African States, \r\nand would like to align myself with the statement to be \r\ndelivered by the representative of Egypt on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China.\r\nWe welcome the reports of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/73/269, A/73/270 and A/73/273) on the items \r\nunder discussion. We wish to express our appreciation \r\nto the Secretary-General for his leadership and \r\ncontinued commitment in placing Africa’s agenda at \r\nthe heart of the United Nations development system. \r\nIt is a testimony to the valuable partnership that has \r\ncontinued to exist between the African Union (AU) and \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThis year’s general debate coincided with the Africa \r\nDialogue Series, which served as a valuable occasion to \r\nhighlight the synergies linking the various processes and \r\nthe seriousness that must be attached to the development \r\nneeds of the continent. There is no doubt that the United \r\nNations-AU partnership for Africa’s development is \r\na key tool in strengthening complementarities and in \r\naccelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and the AU’s Agenda \r\n2063. We are pleased that this year the Office of the \r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa adopted a new approach \r\nfor the Africa Dialogue Series, and we commend its \r\nefforts in advancing Africa’s development agenda. We \r\nbelieve that such synergy and balance are fundamental \r\nto efforts to address the particular development needs \r\nof our continent. As such, it should be sustained and \r\nimproved upon in the coming years.\r\nThe African Group appreciates the valuable analysis, \r\ninformation and policy recommendations contained in \r\nthe Secretary-General’s reports. They address critical \r\nissues in the debate and advocacy for Africa’s inclusive \r\ngrowth and sustainable development. Since the adoption \r\nby the African Heads of State and Government of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), \r\nthe Partnership has continued to reflect Africa’s \r\nvision and strategic framework for the political and \r\nsocioeconomic transformation of various priority \r\nareas, including agriculture, food security, climate \r\nchange and natural-resource management, as well as \r\nregional integration and infrastructure. NEPAD has \r\nremained committed to facilitating and implementing \r\nAfrica’s priority programmes and to the consolidation \r\nof positive policy initiatives already adopted by African \r\nMember States for the transformation of the continent. \r\nWe take this opportunity to express appreciation to our \r\ndevelopment partners for their assistance in the progress \r\nthat the continent has made in the implementation of its \r\nvarious programmes and projects. We further request \r\nall partners to support efforts by African countries \r\nto promote and maintain macroeconomic stability, \r\nincluding by facilitating the development and transfer \r\nof technology to African countries.\r\nThe existence of the global digital divide highlights \r\nthe need for further investment and the allocation of \r\nadequate resources in order to prevent Africa from \r\nbeing left behind on the path to the information society, \r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 3/28\r\nas the Secretary-General warns in his report (A/73/269). \r\nWe note the findings of the Secretary-General’s report, \r\nparticularly the existence of obstacles to the realization \r\nof the full potential of the application of information and \r\ncommunications technologies, especially in Africa. The \r\nharmonization of the policy and regulatory framework \r\nin the information and communications technology \r\nsector is gaining momentum on the continent, and \r\nthe African Union is making considerable efforts in \r\nthat direction. We therefore call on the international \r\ncommunity to take the relevant steps towards the \r\nachievement of a people-centred, development-\r\noriented information society that is comprehensive in \r\nits inclusivity and committed to the Tunis Agenda for \r\nthe Information Society.\r\nThe African Group notes with great satisfaction \r\nthat the report of the Secretary-General emphasizes \r\nthat agriculture remains at the centre of Africa’s \r\ndevelopment agenda. As indicated in the report, Africa \r\nhas enormous agricultural potential. The continent \r\nboasts the largest share of the world’s uncultivated \r\nfertile land, abundant water resources and proximity to \r\ntransportation links and regional markets. It is therefore \r\nnatural that our agriculture forms a significant portion \r\nof the economies of all African countries. As a sector \r\nwith the potential to create jobs for African youth and \r\nthereby improve their livelihood, we are convinced \r\nthat, with adequate investment, African agriculture \r\ncan contribute to intra-Africa trade and development \r\nand economic diversification. However, in order to \r\neradicate poverty, which remains an overarching goal \r\nfor the African Group, such assistance and investment \r\nmust be socially responsible, environmentally \r\nsustainable and ultimately beneficial to all, including \r\nsmallholder farmers.\r\nThe signing in 2017 of the Joint United Nations-AU \r\nFramework for an Enhanced Partnership in Peace and \r\nSecurity and the follow-up signing in January of the \r\nAU-United Nations Framework for the Implementation \r\nof Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment demonstrate the commitment of the two \r\norganizations to aligning their cooperation with priority \r\nareas. In that regard, the Group stresses the need to \r\npromote an effective and efficient implementation, \r\nfollow-up and review of both Frameworks so as to \r\nmaximize their impact and results on the ground. I would \r\nlike to stress that a multifaceted approach, involving \r\nthe mobilization of resources and the strengthening \r\nof global partnerships for development, is required in \r\norder to achieve that lofty objective.\r\nSustainable development is a collective \r\nopportunity and responsibility that should be achieved \r\nthrough multilateral cooperation, the honouring of \r\ninternational commitments and the provision of means \r\nof implementation support to developing countries. We \r\nare concerned about the growing debt crisis, and we \r\nrequest assistance aimed at ensuring that our volatility \r\nis curtailed. In that connection, we request assistance \r\nto strengthen the national capacities of African States \r\nto access sources of revenue that can be used to boost \r\ngrowth and development. It is also important that \r\ndeveloped countries and official development assistance \r\n(ODA) providers continue to uphold their commitments, \r\nin keeping with their previous undertakings to scale up \r\nODA efforts.\r\nThe African Group further agrees with the \r\nSecretary-General that natural disasters and the \r\neffects of climate change severely affect vulnerable \r\nregions and populations, particularly those of Africa. \r\nAfrica is essentially in a disadvantaged position in the \r\npursuit of sustainable development. As such, increased \r\ninternational assistance in the areas of financing, \r\ntrade, technology transfer and debt relief will be \r\nessential for efforts to support African countries in \r\nthe implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. We appeal to the international community to \r\nenhance support and fulfil its commitments by taking \r\nfurther action in areas critical to Africa’s economic and \r\nsocial development.\r\nThe African Group agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that illicit financial f lows deprive the continent \r\nof vital resources for financing its development \r\npriorities. Stopping those illicit f lows and repatriating \r\nillicit assets and funds to their countries of origin \r\nwill provide the region with increased resources for \r\nfinancing health, education, infrastructure and critical \r\ndevelopment needs. We urge development partners \r\nto support efforts by the African Union and African \r\ncountries to stop that menace through improved \r\ntransparency in tax systems, as well as by disclosing \r\nthe full beneficial ownership structure of companies.\r\nWe note the negative impact of gender disparity \r\nmanifested in the culture and norms of some African \r\ncountries. While the leaders of the region continue to \r\ntake steps to address that challenge in the interest of \r\nall, the African Union, through its various educational \r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n4/28 18-32548\r\ninitiatives and the African Peer Review Mechanism, \r\nwill continue to persevere in the right direction with \r\nregard to that very sensitive issue.\r\nFinally, peace, security and good governance are of \r\nthe utmost priority in all development processes. While \r\nAfrica has experienced a period of sustained economic \r\ngrowth and social progress in the past two decades, \r\nthe effects of wars and violent crimes still persist. We \r\nrequest the United Nations system, partners and all \r\nMember States to continue to assist African countries \r\nemerging from conflict in their efforts to build national \r\ncapacities by fulfilling commitments relevant to \r\ncreating an environment conducive to peace, security \r\nand sustainable development in Africa.\r\nMr. Edrees (Egypt): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to express our appreciation \r\nfor the valuable analysis, information and policy \r\nrecommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreports (A/73/269, A/73/270 and A/73/273), which \r\ncontribute to the debate on issues that are crucial to \r\nAfrica’s inclusive growth and sustainable development.\r\nThe African Union’s Agenda 2063: The Africa \r\nWe Want and its first 10-year implementation plan \r\ndemonstrate Africa’s shared visions and actions \r\ntowards peace and development. The adoption of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015 \r\nfurther underscored the shared commitment of the \r\ninternational community to working tirelessly to \r\neradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions \r\nand to achieving sustainable development in its three \r\ndimensions in a balanced and integrated manner.\r\nThe Group recognizes the complementarities \r\nbetween Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. In that regard, it is crucial \r\nthat we continue to mobilize international support \r\nfor the implementation of those Agendas in order to \r\nachieve greater synergies between the regional and \r\ninternational development frameworks. Three years \r\ninto the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and \r\nAgenda 2063, it is evident that realizing the shared \r\npromise of the two Agendas of leaving no one behind \r\nis contingent upon our collective capacity to mobilize \r\nsufficient means of implementation, including financial \r\nresources, technology transfer and capacity-building, \r\nwhich must be as ambitious as the goals themselves.\r\nIn the same vein, scaling up international support \r\nis crucial for building resilience and promoting \r\nsustainability. In that context, the Group welcomes the \r\nmonitoring mechanism report’s in-depth review of the \r\nimplementation of commitments by African countries \r\nand development partners in various development \r\nareas (A/73/270). As such, the recommendations of \r\nthe report should contribute to better informed policy \r\nresponses to development challenges and enhance the \r\nglobal partnership for development in those critical \r\ndevelopment areas.\r\nThe Group re-emphasizes the critical role of \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) and foreign \r\ndirect investment (FDI), which remain major sources \r\nof financing for development in Africa. The Group is \r\ndeeply concerned about the fact that both ODA and FDI \r\nto Africa have declined over the past years. Therefore, \r\nthe Group would like to reiterate that the fulfilment of \r\nall ODA commitments remains crucial, including the \r\ncommitment on the part of many developed countries \r\nto achieving the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nincome (GNI) for ODA for developing countries and \r\n0.15 to 0.20 per cent of GNI for ODA to least developed \r\ncountries. We urge those that have not fulfilled \r\ntheir commitments to step up efforts towards their \r\nODA targets.\r\nThe Group recalls that African countries have \r\ntaken numerous steps to address peace and security \r\nchallenges at the national and regional levels, including \r\nthe need to deal with terrorism and instability. The \r\nGroup of 77 and China is of the view that in order to \r\ncomplement and strengthen African efforts to address \r\nchallenges to peace and security on the continent, \r\nit is critical that partners enhance their support for \r\nAfrican peace and security activities and help to build \r\nthe continent’s own capacities to prevent and resolve \r\nconflict through increased assistance. We therefore \r\nmaintain the need for the United Nations system to \r\nsupport African regional and subregional organizations \r\nin assisting the efforts of African countries to achieve \r\nthe goal of a conflict-free Africa and to end all wars in \r\nAfrica by 2020.\r\nIn conclusion, the signing of the Joint United \r\nNations-African Union Framework for an Enhanced \r\nPartnership in Peace and Security in April 2017 and of \r\nthe African Union-United Nations Framework for the \r\nImplementation of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development in January demonstrate \r\nthe commitment of the two organizations to aligning \r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 5/28\r\ntheir cooperation to Africa’s needs and priorities. \r\nIt is imperative to promote an effective and efficient \r\nimplementation of, follow-up to and review of both \r\nFrameworks to maximize the impact and results on \r\nthe ground.\r\nMr. Dang (Viet Nam): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of the 10 States members of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nnamely, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \r\nMyanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and my \r\nown country, Viet Nam.\r\nASEAN aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of Egypt on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China.\r\nAt the outset, we thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis reports under this agenda item (A/73/269, A/73/270 \r\nand A/73/273), which have provided a comprehensive \r\nreview of the progress made during the reporting \r\nperiod, as well as constructive and practical insights \r\ninto the way forward.\r\nASEAN reaffirms its solidarity with Africa \r\ntowards the realization of our shared aspirations in the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for growth, \r\nprosperity and sustainable development. We fully \r\nsupport the implementation of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), which will provide \r\na strong foundation for the African Union’s Agenda \r\n2063: The Africa We Want. In that connection, we \r\nwelcome the good progress made over the past years \r\nin achieving the priorities set by NEPAD, in particular \r\nin infrastructure, agriculture, education, gender \r\nmainstreaming and good governance.\r\nWe are pleased to note the positive impact of \r\nthe improving global economic situation on African \r\neconomies. The establishment of the African Continental \r\nFree Trade Area in March will certainly spur greater \r\nintra-African trade and economic integration. We know \r\nthe persistent challenges in the areas of agricultural \r\nproductivity, food security, economic diversification, \r\nmarket access and the lack of financing and capacity. \r\nNonetheless, it is encouraging to see that many African \r\ncountries have continued to intensify their efforts and \r\nseize opportunities to accelerate progress on sustainable \r\ndevelopment in the region. We welcome efforts to \r\nstrengthen the Regional Coordination Mechanism for \r\nAfrica in order to effectively implement Agenda 2063 \r\nand the 2030 Agenda.\r\nASEAN is also of the view that it is important to \r\nalign our ASEAN Community Vision 2025 with the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in order to \r\nactively explore ways to implement the two Agendas \r\nin an integrated way. We believe there is much we can \r\nlearn from one another in that respect.\r\nAs many of our leaders affirmed at the general \r\ndebate last month, our common pursuit of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development is contingent upon \r\nour ability to build robust global partnerships with \r\na strong and effective United Nations at their core. \r\nFor its part, ASEAN will continue to work together \r\nwith all friends and partners, including in Africa, to \r\nuphold the values of multilateralism and honour the \r\ninternational frameworks and agreements to which we \r\nhave committed ourselves. That is part of our shared \r\nresponsibility to our people and planet.\r\nASEAN as a whole, including its individual member \r\nStates, looks forward to strengthening its partnership \r\nwith Africa in implementing those global frameworks \r\nand commitments. Indeed, we believe that there is \r\nscope for greater collaboration between ASEAN and \r\nAfrica. In particular, there is great potential for our \r\nregional organizations and member States to enhance \r\nour linkages and knowledge-sharing in various fields, \r\nsuch as agriculture, education, information and \r\ncommunications technologies, trade and investment \r\nand infrastructure development, including through \r\nSouth-South and triangular cooperation.\r\nIn November 2017, manufacturers and technology \r\nfirms from across Southeast Asia and Africa gathered \r\nin Johannesburg for the first Africa-ASEAN Business \r\nExpo and Forum. That inaugural event was aimed at \r\ncreating a platform for linking businesses from Africa \r\nand ASEAN and catalysing trade and investment \r\nopportunities between the two regions.\r\nIn conclusion, we are in full agreement that \r\ndevelopment partners, international financial \r\ninstitutions, regional and subregional organizations \r\nand the international community must continue to \r\nsupport African countries in their pursuit of sustainable \r\npeace and development. For its part, ASEAN remains \r\nsteadfast in its support for the efforts of our African \r\nfriends and the international community to bring about \r\nmeaningful progress in the implementation of the \r\nNEPAD agenda for the benefit of Africa and of all.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nf loor to the observer of the European Union.\r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n6/28 18-32548\r\nMrs. Pape (European Union): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the European Union \r\nand its member States.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s latest progress report on the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (A/73/269). As \r\na strong supporter of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) from its very beginning, the \r\nEuropean Union welcomes the report’s alignment \r\nwith Agenda 2063 of the African Union and the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, and the report’s \r\noverall finding that African countries continue to make \r\nprogress in the implementation of NEPAD priorities. \r\nWe recognize the importance of infrastructure for the \r\ncontinent’s industrialization and regional integration \r\nand the shortfall in the investments needed to lift Africa \r\nto global standards. We welcome African initiatives to \r\naddress that shortfall, such as the 5% Agenda initiative, \r\nrecently launched by the Continental Business Network \r\nof the NEPAD Agency. The European Union has \r\nlong-standing experience as a partner of the region \r\nin cutting-edge regional investment projects that are \r\nsimilar to those envisaged by the NEPAD initiative. An \r\nexample of those projects is the Caprivi Interconnector \r\nlinking power grids in southern Africa.\r\nWith the European External Investment Plan, \r\nadopted in September 2017, the European Union is \r\nfurther enhancing the scale of its support by crowding \r\nin investments from financial institutions and the \r\nprivate sector through a €1.5 billion guarantee and \r\nblending fund, complemented by technical assistance \r\nand support aimed at improving the investment climate. \r\nIn addition to the existing investment facilities of \r\n€2.6 billion, that fund is expected to leverage more than \r\n€44 billion in investments by 2020.\r\nThe European Union remains by far the most \r\nimportant destination for African exports. We believe \r\nthat there is considerable scope to increase the share \r\nof intra-African trade and welcome the signing of the \r\nAfrican Continental Free Trade Agreement in Kigali \r\nin March. We encourage signatories to ensure timely \r\nratification so as to enable the Agreement to enter \r\ninto force. The European Union and its member States \r\nattribute the same importance to high-quality education \r\nas is outlined in the 2030 Agenda and the African \r\nUnion’s Agenda 2063. In that context, we welcome the \r\nNEPAD Agency’s support for efforts by countries to \r\nachieve gender parity in education. We recommend \r\nthat those efforts be scaled up and integrated into \r\ncomprehensive national policies. The monitoring of \r\nthose policies could become part and parcel of the \r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nare encouraged by the revitalization of the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism. Peers are often in a better \r\nposition to address governance issues, and that will \r\nalso strengthen African ownership of reform agendas. \r\nSuccess will, however, be measured less by the number \r\nof participating countries than by the results achieved. \r\nIn that context, we urge the improved follow-up and \r\nimplementation of the African Peer Review programme \r\nof action. We share the concern expressed by the \r\nSecretary-General about the recent rapid increase in the \r\ndebt levels of many African countries, especially the \r\nshare of debt held by non-Paris Club countries. Prior \r\nto that increase, there had been a massive reduction in \r\nAfrican debt levels since the beginning of the century \r\nthrough the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, \r\nto which the European Union’s collective financing \r\ncontributed 41 per cent of the overall contributions.\r\nWe echo the warning in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport (A/73/269) that excessive borrowing can \r\npotentially choke growth and development, \r\nundermining hard-won socioeconomic gains through \r\ndebt relief. In that context, we would like to stress the \r\nuniversality of the Sustainable Development Goals and \r\nrecall, in particular, Sustainable Development Goal \r\ntarget 17.4. Against that backdrop, it seems evident \r\nthat the forthcoming second High-level United Nations \r\nConference on South-South Cooperation, which is \r\nknown as BAPA+40 and is to be held in Buenos Aires \r\nin March 2019, presents an opportunity to address \r\nthe challenge that should not be missed.\r\nThe European Union continues to firmly stand by \r\nits commitment to the 2030 Agenda, of which the Addis \r\nAbaba Action Agenda is an integral part. We reiterate \r\nthe need to facilitate the use of all sources of financing, \r\nincluding international and national private investment, \r\ndomestic public resources and official development \r\nassistance (ODA), and underline the potential of \r\ninnovative finance. With regard to official development \r\nassistance, the European Union has maintained its role \r\nas the largest provider, accounting for over half of total \r\nODA and increasing its share from 0.31 per cent of its \r\ngross national income in 1999 to 0.50 per cent in 2017.\r\nAfrica remains a priority for the European \r\nUnion and its member States. That is reflected in the \r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 7/28\r\nCommission President Juncker’s announcement, during \r\nhis 12 September State of the Union 2018 address, of \r\na new Africa-Europe alliance aimed at deepening \r\neconomic relations and boosting investment and jobs.\r\nMr. Srivihok (Thailand): Allow me at the outset \r\nto align my statement with that delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China, and by the representative of Viet Nam on \r\nbehalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN). I would also like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the reports submitted under this agenda \r\nitem (A/73/269, A/73/270 and A/73/273).\r\nAfrica is rising, brimming with prospects and \r\npotential. We celebrate the fifty-fifth anniversary of \r\nthe formation of the African Union (AU) this year. \r\nThailand congratulates our African friends on their \r\ntireless efforts and solidarity in working towards an \r\nintegrated, peaceful and prosperous Africa. Much \r\nprogress has been made during the first 10-year \r\nimplementation plan of the AU Agenda 2063. In \r\nparticular, the establishment of the African Continental \r\nFree Trade Area and the signing of the single African \r\nair transport market agreement will no doubt promote \r\ngreater regional integration and business opportunities \r\nfor African peoples and the world.\r\nAlthough geographical distance may separate \r\nThailand and Africa, Thailand and African nations have \r\nalways enjoyed long-standing and friendly relations, \r\nwhich are further enriched by growing economic ties \r\nand cooperation towards sustainable development, \r\npeace and stability and public health.\r\nLooking at Africa today, we cannot ignore its \r\ngrowing role in the global economy and the opportunity \r\nthat it represents. The World Bank currently lists \r\nThailand as ASEAN’s largest trading partner in Africa, \r\nand we see Thai investment growing in the continent’s \r\nbooming sectors, including the energy, fishery, \r\ninfrastructure, automobile and tourism sectors. At the \r\nsame time, we are aware of the challenges faced by the \r\nleast developed countries in global trade, and Thailand \r\nhas been doing its part to promote market access of \r\nAfrican goods in our country through the World Trade \r\nOrganization’s duty-free and quota-free scheme, which \r\nin 2015 we committed to implementing for five years.\r\nDevelopment cooperation is another area where \r\nThailand and Africa share a common aspiration. \r\nThailand has always been a strong supporter of South-\r\nSouth and triangular cooperation, which aims not only \r\nto achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nbut also the unfinished business of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Our development cooperation \r\nin Africa follows a demand-driven approach that \r\naims to build strength towards the goal of self-\r\nreliance. Through the Thailand-Africa Partnership for \r\nSustainable Development, we are set to share the best \r\npractices of our home-grown development approach \r\nwith Africa in areas including agriculture, human \r\nresources development and public health.\r\nDevelopment cannot be sustainable without peace. \r\nThailand stresses the importance of creating conditions \r\nconducive to sustainable peace and commends the \r\npositive trends in Africa. Thailand has taken part in \r\npast and present United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nalongside many African nations. We are proud to say \r\nthat our peacekeepers are early peacebuilders and that \r\nthey approach their mandated tasks with our late King’s \r\nsufficiency economy philosophy in their hearts and \r\nminds. This year, our horizontal military engineering \r\ncompany will join the peacekeeping mission in \r\nSouth Sudan.\r\nWhile Africa has made remarkable development \r\nprogress, one of the most challenging tasks is promoting \r\nlivelihoods and ensuring healthy populations in the \r\nprocess of achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, while leaving no one behind. Thailand \r\ncommends the continuing role of the international \r\ncommunity in the progress achieved on malaria control \r\nand prevention. We need to redouble our efforts to end \r\nmalaria by 2030, as envisioned by SDG target 3.3. We \r\nreiterate our continued support to our African friends \r\nthrough our capacity-building programmes in health-\r\ncare management as well as in the prevention and \r\nmanagement of epidemics.\r\nIn conclusion, let us look ahead. One critical \r\nobjective for Thailand during its chairmanship of \r\nASEAN next year will be promoting cooperation and \r\npartnership for sustainable development with our \r\npartners around the world. In that context, Thailand \r\nreiterates its commitment to cooperating with Africa \r\nin the pursuit of our common aspirations to prosperity, \r\nsustainable development, peace and a healthier world.\r\nMs. Alnaser (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, my delegation has the pleasure of congratulating \r\nMs. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on presiding over \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-third session. We \r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n8/28 18-32548\r\nlook forward to the positive work that will be done \r\nduring this session.\r\nI would like to commend the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/73/269) on the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD). We have looked \r\nwith great interest at that effective partnership between \r\nthe United Nations and the African continent, which \r\nhas culminated in the strengthening of peace, security \r\nand stability on the continent. The aim is to address \r\nthe political, economic and development challenges \r\nin Africa so that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment can be effectively implemented.\r\nIn the context of the Secretary-General’s review \r\nof the development efforts made by the Organization \r\nin conjunction with the African Union (AU), my \r\ncountry supports all measures undertaken to promote \r\nsustainable development in Africa and to strengthen \r\ncooperation with the African continent through the AU, \r\nin particular the agreement signed between the United \r\nNations and the AU in 2017, as it represents a basic \r\npillar to support development on that continent.\r\nMy country commends the achievements of \r\nAfrican countries in the area of development. We \r\nalso support all joint efforts between the United \r\nNations and the AU aimed at establishing a common \r\nstrategy in order to implement the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and Agenda 2063 for African \r\ndevelopment, which was announced at the African \r\nsummit held in Addis Ababa on 28 and 29 January. \r\nThat framework seeks to expedite the implementation \r\nof Agenda 2063 and to integrate the United Nations \r\nand AU Agendas into one to ensure their effective \r\nimplementation, while contributing to the achievement \r\nof a lasting, people-centred environmental structural \r\ntransformation in Africa.\r\nDespite all the gains that have been made, we still \r\nremain concerned about the many obstacles that exist. \r\nHigh-ranking officials in Africa, the AU and the United \r\nNations must enhance those gains to the fullest by \r\nimplementing the following points.\r\nFirst, they must find solutions to the many conflicts \r\nand situations of instability in various parts of Africa \r\nthrough cooperation and support to peacekeeping \r\noperations in the various African regions concerned, \r\nas well as provide support to African peace operations. \r\nSecondly, they must provide support to the security \r\nand police sectors in certain African States in order \r\nto protect defenceless civilians from any violations \r\nto which they might be subjected. Thirdly, they must \r\nstrengthen human rights, social justice and all policies \r\nrelated to conduct and discipline in the area of sexual \r\nexploitation and abuse, which is important for the \r\nsupport of AU peace operations.\r\nMy country takes pride in our historical relationship \r\nwith African States. We enjoy observer status in the \r\nAU. In 2013, my country hosted the third Africa-Arab \r\nSummit under the theme “Partners in development \r\nand investment”, at which His Highness Sheikh Sabah \r\nAl-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah announced an initiative \r\nto grant soft loans to non-Arab African countries for \r\nfive years through the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic \r\nDevelopment. Furthermore, during the Summit \r\nthe State of Kuwait announced that it would invest \r\n$1 billion through the General Investment Authority \r\nin cooperation with the World Bank, its affiliates and \r\nthe China-Africa Development Fund. That amount of \r\nmoney would be invested in the infrastructure of the \r\nAfrican continent.\r\nThrough the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic \r\nDevelopment, which was established more than 56 \r\nyears ago, my country has contributed effectively to the \r\nsupport of sustainable development in many countries \r\nof the world, especially countries on the African \r\ncontinent. The Kuwait Fund has cooperated with nearly \r\n42 African countries. We have focused particularly on \r\nthe road sector and have diversified our development \r\nprojects to include the granting of soft loans and other \r\nnon-refundable loans by the Kuwait Fund and the \r\nKuwaiti Government. The Kuwait Fund granted 312 \r\nsoft loans during the fiscal year 2017-2018.\r\nThe State of Kuwait has also participated \r\neffectively through the Kuwait Fund for Arab \r\nEconomic Development in the Heavily Indebted Poor \r\nCountries Initiative, which was launched in 1996 by the \r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund. We \r\nhave also participated in the Multilateral Debt Relief \r\nInitiative, and the Kuwait Fund has rescheduled its \r\nloans to the borrowing countries. The Kuwait Fund \r\nhas also implemented debt-relief agreements with 27 \r\nAfrican States.\r\nIn conclusion, my country is committed to helping \r\nthe least developed countries because we fully support \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We \r\nhope that African States will benefit from the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General on supporting development and \r\nstability in Africa.\r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 9/28\r\nMr. Annakou (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis reports on this agenda item (A/73/269, A/73/270 and \r\nA/73/273). I also wish to thank Ms. Bience Gawanas, \r\nthe Secretary-General’s Special Adviser on Africa, and \r\nMr. Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, Chief Executive Officer \r\nof the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) Planning and Coordinating Agency, for their \r\nefforts in supporting the African continent.\r\nWe also align ourselves with the statements made \r\nby the representative of Egypt on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China, and by the representative of Morocco on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States. I would now like \r\nto express the concerns of my country, Libya.\r\nThis meeting on NEPAD is being held three \r\nyears after world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, the main objective of \r\nwhich is to leave no one behind, and African leaders \r\nlaunched the African Union’s Agenda 2063, a 50-\r\nyear plan aimed at establishing peace, security and \r\ndevelopment in Africa, and its first 10-year human-\r\nbased implementation plan for achieving development.\r\nToday, I will focus on the relationship between \r\ndevelopment and security — as there can be no security \r\nwithout peace and no peace without security — in the \r\nlight of the present report of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa (A/73/273). This \r\nyear marks the twentieth anniversary of the annual \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on that subject.\r\nAccording to the report, conflicts in Africa tend \r\nto be intra-State rather than inter-State conflicts, \r\nand they have regional dimensions. They are \r\ntypically transnational conflicts in which multiple \r\nactors participate. Conflict prevention constitutes \r\nthe overriding mandate of the United Nations and \r\nrepresents an integral part of the work of regional and \r\nsubregional organizations, such as the African Union. \r\nThe question that should be asked today is what has the \r\ninternational community done to help African States \r\nestablish security and stability. More importantly, what \r\nhave the African States or the African Union done to \r\nhelp a founding member, such as Libya, to tackle its \r\ndifficult circumstances?\r\nLibya is the northern gate of Africa, and instability \r\nin my country means an expansion of conflict. Have the \r\ncountries of the African Union helped Libya, or have \r\nthey instead contributed to exacerbating the situation \r\nin my country? To set the record straight, allow me to \r\nbe transparent and clear in addressing certain issues \r\nto which my country, Libya, has been subjected since \r\n2011. Those issues reveal what Libya has been going \r\nthrough during a difficult transition phase.\r\nFirst, political instability, conflicts and armed \r\nclashes have often led to a weakened State and \r\nprevented Libya from safeguarding its borders. That \r\nin turn enables gangs trafficking in arms and persons \r\nto practise exploitation in countries of origin and \r\ndestination. Because of its current circumstances, \r\nLibya, as a transit country, is subjected to massive \r\nwaves of illegal migration from sub-Saharan countries. \r\nThat has exacerbated the humanitarian situation in \r\nLibya owing to the inability of my country to control \r\nits borders, while neighbouring States have lagged \r\nin their efforts to monitor their borders. Countries \r\nof origin put the blame on the transit country, which \r\nis the victim and not the cause of the problem. The \r\ncountries of origin and destination should assume their \r\nresponsibilities towards illegal migrants, who suffer as \r\na result of the actions of trafficking networks in those \r\ncountries. Those networks are the driving force behind \r\nthe risky migration in the desert and on the seas.\r\nIt is necessary to tackle the root causes of the \r\nproblem, not its symptoms, which requires genuine \r\ndevelopment in the countries of origin with the help \r\nof the destination countries, specifically through the \r\ntransfer of technology, capacity-building, job creation \r\nand the provision of support for small and medium-\r\nsized businesses, as well as action to combat criminal \r\ngangs in the countries of origin and destination and the \r\ntransit countries. Once stability is achieved in Libya \r\nand reconstruction is initiated, we can assure Members \r\nthat we will be able to accommodate a large number of \r\nour African brothers as workers, in a regular and legal \r\nway that protects the rights of both the Libyan State and \r\nAfrican workers.\r\nSecondly, with regard to sustainable development \r\nand maintaining the rights of future generations, which \r\nconstitutes one of its pillars, I would refer to the assets \r\nof the Libyan sovereign wealth fund that have been \r\nfrozen pursuant to various relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions. Those assets are losing value owing to \r\nthe sanctions regime imposed since 2011, which is \r\nsupposed to preserve those assets and funds. However, \r\nin reality, the sanctions have caused those funds and \r\nassets to incur enormous ongoing losses. Since March \r\n2016, we have provided the Security Council and its \r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n10/28 18-32548\r\nCommittee established pursuant to resolution 1970 \r\n(2011) concerning Libya with extensive information \r\nabout the huge losses incurred. We have requested \r\nthat the Security Council amend the current sanctions \r\nregime so as to improve the management of those frozen \r\nassets without lifting the freeze in order to prevent such \r\nlosses, which are not inevitable, and maintain that part \r\nof the Libyan people’s wealth for the sake of future \r\ngenerations. However, the Security Council has not \r\nresponded to our repeated requests, which we regret. \r\nWhat have the three African countries that are members \r\nof the Security Council done in that regard? Did they \r\nsupport our interests and defend those legitimate, fair \r\nand urgent requests?\r\nThirdly, what is worse is that many African States \r\nhave exploited the difficult transitional stage in Libya \r\nand started to confiscate and seize Libyan investments \r\nin their territories under false pretexts that run counter to \r\nsigned agreements and international law. In that regard, \r\nwe confirm that Libya intends to take all appropriate \r\nlegal measures to restore its assets and its losses. The \r\nposition of all those countries towards Libya during the \r\ncurrent phase will constitute a fundamental factor in \r\nour future relations with them.\r\nFourthly, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda have \r\ncalled for the mobilization of the necessary financial \r\nresources to achieve the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. As part of mobilizing those resources, it is time \r\nfor all countries to cooperate in order to implement \r\nthe United Nations Convention against Corruption and \r\nto establish mechanisms for returning stolen funds to \r\ntheir legitimate owners. In that regard, Libya looks \r\nforward to receiving help from all those countries \r\nto which the funds of the Libyan people have been \r\nsmuggled. Those funds should be disclosed and must be \r\nreturned to Libya in order to cover part of the funding \r\nneeded to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. In that context, we call on States Members \r\nof the United Nations not to let their institutions serve \r\nas safe havens for the smuggled funds and to stop the \r\nsmuggling of money and the encouragement of the \r\ncorrupt perpetrators.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I ask the General Assembly \r\nonce again if those illicit f lows of funds would have \r\nbeen possible had developed States not allowed their \r\ninstitutions to serve as safe havens for corrupt money. \r\nWould the corruption and illegal f lows, which have \r\namounted to $100 billion from Africa annually, \r\naccording to reports of the United Nations and \r\ninternational financial institutions, have continued \r\nwithout the acquiescence of certain developed \r\ncountries? Will the African Union set an example by \r\naddressing money f lows and money smuggling within \r\nthe continent, namely, from African States to African \r\nsafe havens? Will African States stop serving as safe \r\nhavens for corrupt money?\r\nIn conclusion, the difficult transitional stages \r\nand the many internal concerns that we are currently \r\nexperiencing have prevented Libya from playing \r\nan effective role in Africa. However, we assure the \r\nAssembly that Libya will establish stability and soon \r\nstand as a civil State based on the separation of powers, \r\nthe rule of law and the peaceful rotation of power. \r\nWe will perform our effective role in true partnership \r\nwith Africa in order to advance the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development and help to ensure progress, \r\ngrowth and prosperity for African countries. That can be \r\ndone through coordination, joint work and commitment \r\nto the cooperation agreements that have been signed \r\nwith many African countries. We will also work \r\ntogether to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the African Union Agenda 2063 so \r\nthat Africa will become a developed continent capable \r\nof contributing positively to the advancement and \r\nprosperity of humankind.\r\nMrs. Furman (Israel): The theme of the current \r\nsession of the General Assembly is “Making the \r\nUnited Nations relevant to all people: global leadership \r\nand shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies”. In that spirit, we need to \r\nfocus on empowering one another, strengthening ties \r\nand embracing the global responsibility to achieve \r\nworldwide sustainable development.\r\nAs highlighted in the most recent reports of the \r\nSecretary-General on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (А/73/269, А/73/270 and А/73/273), \r\nAfrican countries continue to make progress in the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) and the African Union’s Agenda 2063 in areas \r\nranging from health care and education to agriculture \r\nand women’s empowerment. Africa faces many of \r\nthe same development challenges that Israel has been \r\ntackling since its establishment 70 years ago, only a \r\nfew years before many African countries also gained \r\ntheir independence.\r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 11/28\r\nDiplomatic relations between Israel and Africa go \r\nback to the 1950s when Golda Meir — Israel’s then \r\nForeign Minister and later Prime Minister — visited \r\nthe continent for the first time. The aim of that historic \r\ntrip was to share Israel’s experience and know-\r\nhow with many of those newly formed nations. That \r\nwas when she decided to create Israel’s Agency for \r\nInternational Development Cooperation (MASHAV), \r\nwhich is responsible for the design, coordination and \r\nimplementation of the State of Israel’s worldwide \r\ndevelopment and cooperation programmes.\r\nFor the past 60 years, MASHAV has worked \r\nwith our African partners in the fields of health care, \r\nagriculture, education, women’s empowerment and \r\ninnovation. Some 70,000 trainees have benefited \r\nfrom training programmes within Israel and in on-site \r\ncourses throughout the continent. MASHAV follows \r\na train-the-trainer capacity-building approach. That \r\nensures that African States can continue to rely on \r\ntheir own expertise in future generations, making the \r\ndevelopment in question truly sustainable.\r\nIn Ethiopia, for example, MASHAV works with \r\nthe Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture to promote \r\neconomic growth in rural areas by organizing \r\nworkshops on horticulture production and marketing \r\nfor small farmers. That training has led to concrete \r\ndevelopments, including increased avocado exports \r\nand enhanced irrigation efficiency.\r\nIn another project, MASHAV partnered with local \r\nauthorities in Ghana to reduce infant mortality and \r\nimprove access to high-quality health care by enhancing \r\nthe professional capacity of hospitals and medical staff. \r\nWe also work with the Government on another project \r\nto improve childhood education.\r\nIn Kenya, Israel is working in cooperation with \r\nUN-Women and Kenyatta University to develop \r\nleadership skills among women, empowering them to \r\nengage effectively in political processes and to bring \r\nabout change in business and public life.\r\nIsrael is currently engaged in several agricultural \r\nprojects, including a rural development centre in \r\nRwanda to support the country’s national plan to \r\nmodernize its agricultural sector and alleviate rural \r\npoverty. All those projects and other MASHAV projects \r\non the continent not only benefit local populations but \r\nalso help Africa to achieve the SDGs. In that context, \r\nI would also like to note that next month, Israel will \r\nhost a conference on the effect of climate change on \r\nAfrica. According to United Nations experts on climate \r\nchange, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \r\nChange and other climate models, Africa is one of \r\nthe continents most vulnerable to climate change. The \r\nconference will attempt to examine the measures that \r\nshould be implemented in order to assist the continent \r\nin combating the effects of climate change and \r\nits ramifications.\r\nWhile time does not permit me to elaborate on all the \r\nprojects and partnerships between African States and \r\nIsrael, I want to highlight one Israeli non-governmental \r\norganization that is doing tremendous work in Africa \r\nto save children’s lives. Save a Child’s Heart, which \r\nrecently won the 2018 United Nations Population \r\nAward, provides free heart surgery to children in \r\nneed in many African countries. That humanitarian \r\norganization not only brings thousands of children \r\nto Israel for heart surgery not available in their own \r\ncountries, but also trains African doctors and medical \r\npersonnel to perform such operations back home.\r\nOur relationship with Africa has never been \r\nstronger, and increasing those ties is a top priority for \r\nIsrael. A testament to that is the fact that Israeli Prime \r\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu has visited Africa three \r\ntimes in the past two years. I wish to reaffirm Israel’s \r\ncommitment to continuing its efforts to support the \r\ndevelopment of Africa. Israel will continue to share its \r\nknowledge and expertise so as to inspire and support \r\nfellow nations, communities and individuals on their \r\njourney to achieve sustainable development.\r\nThrough the exchange of ideas and strategies, our \r\nnations can combat mutual challenges together, using \r\nsustainable solutions proved to work. We stand with our \r\nAfrican partners to build a brighter future.\r\nMr. Chumakov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We note with satisfaction that African countries \r\nare making consistent progress towards socioeconomic \r\ntransformation. Progress in areas such as industry, \r\nagriculture, health care, education, information and \r\ncommunications technology and innovation is of \r\nparticular importance. The establishment of a single \r\nAfrican air transport market and an African free \r\ntrade area serve as important steps towards economic \r\ndevelopment and regional integration. Lifting tariff \r\nand non-tariff barriers will help to boost intra-African \r\ntrade, and regular direct f lights among countries will \r\ncreate momentum for the development of industry, \r\ntrade and tourism. It is evident that such efforts will, \r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n12/28 18-32548\r\nultimately, help to eradicate poverty. We believe that \r\nAfrican countries need to determine independently, on \r\nthe basis of their national priorities, their policies for \r\nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the \r\nAfrican Union’s Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want.\r\nAlong those lines, States can leverage their \r\ncomparative advantages and study the lessons and \r\nexperience of other global markets. We value the desire \r\nof countries to boost mechanisms for domestic resource \r\nmobilization and expand public-private partnerships, \r\nincluding by establishing independent tax authorities, \r\nintroducing a value-added tax, ensuring transparency \r\nin revenues and expenditure and improving the overall \r\nbusiness climate. At the same time, it is clear that \r\nthe international community, in particular developed \r\ncountries, need to continue to deliver assistance to \r\nAfrica as it seeks to achieve sustainable development.\r\nThe Russian Federation is a long-standing \r\npartner in and donor to international efforts to \r\ndeliver multifaceted assistance to African countries. \r\nSpecifically with regard to trade, we provide broad \r\nconcessional arrangements to a host of countries. With \r\nregard to African goods, a concessional duty and tariff \r\nregime covers the lion’s share of Russian imports from \r\nAfrica. Russia is also proactively helping to ease the \r\ndebt burden of African countries. To date, under the \r\nHighly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, Africa’s \r\nprincipal debt has been written off, amounting to more \r\nthan $20 billion. Under the Debt for Development \r\nprogramme, intergovernmental agreements are being \r\nimplemented with Madagascar, Mozambique and \r\nTanzania. More than 11,000 African students attend \r\nRussian tertiary education institutions. The Russian \r\nFederation provides contributions to international \r\nassistance programmes for Africa through the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the \r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, the \r\nWorld Food Programme and the International Civil \r\nDefence Organization. We have contributed $20 million \r\nto implement the World Bank programme to combat \r\nmalaria in African countries. We have also contributed \r\n$18 million to WHO to implement the global polio \r\neradication initiative.\r\nThe Russian Federation is keen to develop \r\nwide-ranging partnerships with African countries. We \r\nstand ready to continue to facilitate sustained economic \r\ngrowth and greater employment in order to develop \r\ninfrastructure and overcome health-care challenges.\r\nMr. Al-Kuwari (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the President of the General \r\nAssembly for convening today’s meeting to discuss the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nWe have taken note of the reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral under this agenda item (A/73/269, A/73/270). \r\nOne of those two reports refers to the formidable \r\nchallenges that African countries face in achieving \r\nsustainable development and the importance of the \r\ninternational community providing more support \r\nthrough financing, trade and debt relief. All those \r\nissues are crucial in supporting African countries in the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the causes \r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/73/273) contains \r\nmany important recommendations and conclusions. \r\nIt indicates the importance of taking all necessary \r\nmeasures to help African countries avert the outbreak \r\nor recurrence of crises and violent conflicts, which \r\nhave a negative impact on civilian populations and \r\nundermine institutions and the capacity for achieving \r\npeace and development.\r\nIt goes without saying that addressing the root \r\ncauses of conflict is important in order to achieve the \r\ngoal of ensuring a conflict-free and harmonious Africa, \r\nin the context of implementing Agenda 2063 of the \r\nAfrican Union, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which emphasizes the importance of \r\nsupporting NEPAD and Agenda 2063, seen as an \r\nintegral part of the sustainable development agenda.\r\nThe State of Qatar believes that the achievement of \r\nsecurity, stability and peace for all nations contributes \r\nsignificantly to efforts to attain sustainable development \r\nand to change people’s lives for the better. The State \r\nof Qatar plays an important role in the international \r\ncommunity to that end. It is committed to providing \r\nsupport to developing countries that seek to improve \r\nlivelihoods in their communities. The State of Qatar \r\nhas provided voluntary development assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries, in particular the least developed \r\ncountries; development assistance at the governmental \r\nand non-governmental levels exceeded $2 billion in \r\n2017. The African continent received the lion’s share.\r\nUnder the wise leadership of His Highness the \r\nEmir of the State of Qatar and in solidarity with \r\nAfrican nations, we continue to step up our efforts to \r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 13/28\r\nassist development projects in Africa and to support the \r\ninfrastructure, education and health sectors.\r\nMr. Yelchenko (Ukraine) Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe Qatar Development Fund has provided \r\ndeveloping countries in Africa with financial resources \r\nthrough relief and development projects, including \r\nsupport for 596,000 students to enrol in primary \r\neducation. That reflects our firm belief in the fact \r\nthat access to primary education for children is a \r\ndriving force in human development. We also support \r\ninfrastructure projects, such as those related to building \r\nroads, power generation and health care.\r\nAfrican States have the primary responsibility \r\nfor their socioeconomic development. However, the \r\nsupport of the international community is needed to \r\nassist the efforts of those States. The commitments \r\nmade by the international community in that respect \r\nshould be honoured. The State of Qatar reiterates that it \r\nwill remain committed to working in partnership with \r\nthe international community in order to advance the \r\nsustainable development agenda, in particular NEPAD.\r\nMs. Blais (Canada): It is an honour for Canada \r\nto make this statement at today’s debate on the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development. Canada has \r\nactively participated, as a partner and a peer, in \r\nthis week’s Africa Dialogue Series. We very much \r\nappreciate the opportunity to listen to our friends and \r\ncolleagues as we explore a stronger African Union and \r\nUnited Nations partnership for peace, security and \r\ndevelopment in Africa. Canada understands that we \r\nneed to listen and learn in order to contribute to better \r\noutcomes. That is what we do, both at home and abroad \r\nand in this Hall today.\r\nCanada commends the leadership of African \r\ncountries, the African Union and the regional economic \r\ncommunities in efforts to advance regional integration \r\nand mainstream the priorities of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the African Union’s \r\nAgenda 2063: The Africa We Want. We should all \r\nsupport Africa as it works to create opportunities for \r\nits youth and to meet its ambitions. Africa will do that \r\nthrough greater economic integration, which will lead \r\nto prosperity.\r\nDuring the General Assembly’s high-level week, \r\nCanada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, was proud to \r\npartner with President Akufo-Addo of Ghana, President \r\nKagame of Rwanda and Prime Minister May of the \r\nUnited Kingdom to lead a discussion on investing in \r\ndecent jobs and opportunities for young people across \r\nAfrica. Let me take a moment to acknowledge that the \r\nWorld Bank has just confirmed that Seychelles has \r\nmade the most progress in achieving the development \r\nof human capital. It is an inspiration to all Africa that \r\na small nation can make so much progress in only a \r\nshort period of time. We also know that over the next \r\n20 years, the world’s 10 fastest growing cities will all \r\nbe in Africa. To support that reality, we need to build \r\nessential infrastructure.\r\nTo help bridge the financial gap in order to make \r\nthat happen, Prime Minister Trudeau announced the \r\ncreation of an affiliate of the Global Infrastructure \r\nHub in Toronto to leverage Canada’s expertise in \r\ninfrastructure so as to help connect capital to projects \r\nin Africa and beyond. Such projects fuel long-term \r\neconomic growth and support the transition to a low-\r\ncarbon economy, while making progress towards \r\nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand improving the representation of women and \r\nmarginalized groups in sustainable infrastructure. Aid \r\nalone is not enough. Economic growth also derives \r\nfrom high-quality education. That is why Canada led \r\nthe Group of Seven (G-7) in raising $4 billion towards \r\ngirls’ education. The Prime Minister was very pleased \r\nto sit down with the Presidents of the Central African \r\nRepublic, Sierra Leone and Zambia and the Foreign \r\nMinister of The Gambia at this year’s session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to discuss the issue and to find out \r\nfrom them how the money can be disbursed and how we \r\ncan work with them to achieve that common goal.\r\nWith respect to climate change, in a statement \r\nto the General Assembly to mark the opening of the \r\nParis Agreement for signature in 2016, Prime Minister \r\nTrudeau said that developing countries should not be \r\npunished for a problem they did not create, nor should \r\nthey be deprived of the opportunities for clean growth \r\nthat developed nations are now pursuing.\r\nTherefore, as part of our G-7 presidency this \r\nyear, we felt strongly that we needed to tackle the \r\nissue of climate resilience and disaster recovery. We \r\nwere honoured that the Presidents of Rwanda, Kenya, \r\nSouth Africa and Seychelles participated in that \r\ncritical conversation.\r\nOur oceans and coasts are under considerable threat. \r\nResilient coastal communities and healthy oceans are \r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n14/28 18-32548\r\nvital to growing economies that work for everyone, and \r\nthat is why we are committed to working with others \r\nto protect the world’s oceans. In that vein, Canada will \r\npartner with Kenya and Japan to host the first global \r\nconference on the sustainable blue economy this fall in \r\nNairobi. We hope that all Members will join us.\r\nUnder the 2030 Agenda, we also collectively \r\nagreed to end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis and \r\nmalaria over the next 12 years. For that reason, Canada \r\ncontinues to support the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, an organization that works \r\nclosely with sub-Saharan countries and disburses 65 per \r\ncent of its funding to eliminate those three diseases.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada believes in African leadership. In that \r\nregard, Canada joined the consensus to elect Louise \r\nMushikiwabo of Rwanda to head the International \r\nOrganization of la Francophonie. We congratulate \r\nher and look forward to working with her. With the \r\nAssembly’s support, Canada, with French as one of its \r\nofficial languages, will be a voice for la Francophonie in \r\nthe Security Council for the period from 2021 to 2022.\r\nCanada is proud to continue its long history of \r\ncontributing to international peace, security and \r\nstability, including through our deployments in \r\nthe United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in Mali, the United Nations \r\nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and the United Nations \r\nMission in South Sudan. As gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women and girls are key priorities \r\nfor Canada, we have launched the Elsie Initiative, a \r\npilot project to increase the meaningful participation \r\nof women in United Nations peacekeeping operations. \r\nCanada will establish bilateral technical assistance \r\nand training partnerships with the Ghana armed forces \r\nand the Zambia police force. We will also support the \r\nimplementation of the gender-mainstreaming strategy \r\nin Senegal’s armed forces.\r\nOnly together can we meet the great challenges \r\nof our time and, in particular, seize emerging \r\nopportunities. Whether it is creating economic growth \r\nfor the benefit of all, combating climate change or \r\nbuilding a more peaceful world, Canada is committed \r\nto working with African Member States to build a \r\nbetter future for us all.\r\nMs. Krisnamurthi (Indonesia): Indonesia aligns \r\nitself with the statements delivered by the representative \r\nof Egypt on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and the \r\nrepresentative of Viet Nam on behalf of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations.\r\nMy delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports (A/73/269, A/73/270 and \r\nA/73/273) under this agenda item, which highlight the \r\nprogress achieved in the implementation of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and set \r\nforth practical recommendations.\r\nMy delegation is very pleased to see positive \r\ntransformations taking place in Africa. African \r\neconomies continue to gain momentum, following the \r\nupturn in the global economy. Overall, growth reached \r\n3.6 per cent in 2017, exceeding the rate in other regions \r\nand marking a significant rebound from 2.2 per cent \r\nin 2016. The continent is also making strides in the \r\nimplementation of the NEPAD priorities, particularly \r\nagriculture, infrastructure, education, gender \r\nmainstreaming and governance. The establishment of \r\nthe African Continental Free Trade Area in March is \r\na welcome development, with the potential to promote \r\nintra-African trade and greater economic integration. \r\nWhile NEPAD embodies African countries’ acceptance \r\nof responsibility for their own development, sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa cannot be achieved by the \r\nAfrican countries alone. We all share the responsibility \r\nto ensure that African countries are not left behind.\r\nThe critical role of official development assistance \r\nand foreign direct investment cannot be overstated, and \r\nwe call for the fulfilment of all the commitments of \r\nthat kind made by development partners. Efforts must \r\nbe made to provide debt relief for African countries. \r\nWe must address Africa’s disproportionately low share \r\nof international trade. Infrastructure development \r\nis imperative to facilitate trade and promote Africa’s \r\nintegration into the global economy. Equally critical \r\nis the continuous provision of capacity-building and \r\npolicy advisory support.\r\nIndonesia has always been a true partner for \r\nAfrican countries. Such a partnership can be traced \r\nas far back as the 1955 Asian-African Conference held \r\nin Bandung, Indonesia. We take pride in co-initiating \r\nwith South Africa the New Asia Africa Strategic \r\nPartnership to promote cooperation between the two \r\nregions. With no less than 1,100 participants over \r\nthe past decade, African countries continue to be \r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 15/28\r\namong the top recipients of Indonesia’s South-South \r\ncooperation programme, which is based entirely on the \r\nprinciples of non-conditionality and demand-driven \r\nconsiderations. Early this year, Indonesia also hosted \r\nthe first-ever Indonesia-Africa Forum to promote \r\ntrade and investment cooperation. Suffice it to say that \r\nthe Forum was a great success, resulting in business \r\ndeals worth no less than $586 million. During the \r\nForum, a series of meetings was also held to begin \r\npreferential trade agreement discussions with a number \r\nof African countries.\r\nBuilding on that momentum, we will convene the \r\nIndonesia-Africa Infrastructure Dialogue in August \r\n2019, which will address that issue of high priority to \r\nboth Indonesia and Africa. Later this month, Indonesia \r\nwill host the Indonesia-Africa Maritime Dialogue on \r\nthe margins of the “Our Ocean” Conference to explore \r\ncooperation on sustainable fisheries and maritime \r\nsecurity, including through the exchange of best \r\npractices and capacity-building.\r\nThere can be no sustainable development without \r\npeace. Indonesia is committed to supporting peace and \r\nstability in Africa, including through its participation \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping. No fewer than 1,388 \r\nIndonesian peacekeepers are currently deployed in \r\nseven United Nations peacekeeping missions in Africa, \r\nand we are now in the process of deploying a 850-person \r\nstrong rapid deployment brigade to the United Nations \r\nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nAllow me to conclude by commending African \r\nleaders for their excellent stewardship and unwavering \r\ncommitment to the pursuit of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development. Indonesia stands ready to be \r\npart of the positive transformation of Africa.\r\nMr. Sinha (India): We align our statement with the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nWe meet at a time when we are well under way \r\non the journey towards the achievement of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, adopted three \r\nyears ago. In addition, our African partners have also \r\ncommenced the first phase of the implementation of \r\nthe African Union’s mutually reinforcing, longer-term \r\nAgenda 2063. Africa has made rapid strides in recent \r\nyears in every aspect. Compared with even a decade \r\nago, the continent is more peaceful. Its governance \r\ninstitutions are stronger. Its overall economic output \r\nhas grown. Poverty rates have fallen. Infrastructure \r\nand connectivity are improving, and the economies are \r\nmore diversified. Life expectancy has increased. Infant \r\nand maternal mortality rates have fallen. Africa is a \r\nyoung continent. It is projected to account for nearly \r\none fifth of the world’s population by 2030, with a \r\ndemographic dividend that can be of great advantage \r\nprovided that young people have the education and the \r\nskills needed for economic opportunities.\r\nLong-standing trade and diaspora links across the \r\nIndian Ocean, a shared colonial past and our common \r\ndevelopment challenges have framed India’s relationship \r\nwith Africa. Going forward, shared prosperity is the \r\ntheme of our partnership. Our development partnership \r\ncurrently includes the implementation of 180 lines of \r\ncredit, worth approximately $11 billion, in over 40 \r\nAfrican countries. At the previous India-Africa Forum \r\nSummit, we committed a concessional line of credit \r\nof $10 billion and $600 million in grant assistance. \r\nEvery year, more than 8,000 African young people are \r\ntrained in a diverse set of programmes in India. As \r\nalways, our efforts will be driven by African priorities. \r\nIndian companies have invested more than $54 billion \r\nin Africa.\r\nOur trade with Africa now amounts to more than \r\n$62 billion. That is over 21 per cent more than in the \r\nprevious year. Africa’s exports to India are growing, \r\nand our economic ties are now increasingly driven by \r\nnew partnerships of innovation in the digital economy. \r\nThe Pan-African e-Network Project links 48 African \r\ncountries to India and to one another. It can become the \r\nnew backbone of digital innovation in Africa. Working \r\nwith several African coastal nations, our partnership \r\nnow seeks increasingly to harness the benefits of \r\nthe blue economy in a sustainable manner. India’s \r\nmedicines have turned the tide on diseases that were \r\nonce a threat to Africa’s future. They also continue to \r\nmake health care affordable and accessible to many. \r\nThe International Solar Alliance, championed by India \r\nand France, has been joined by 70 nations, including 25 \r\nfrom Africa. The Alliance is making ambitious strides \r\nin contributing tangibly to global efforts to promote \r\nrenewable energy and climate action.\r\nIndian leaders continue to attach a very high \r\npriority to our partnership with Africa. Earlier this \r\nyear, Prime Minister Modi paid an official visit to three \r\ncountries of the continent. During the past four years, \r\nthe top leadership of India, including the President, \r\nVice-President and Prime Minister, have visited more \r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n16/28 18-32548\r\nthan 20 African countries. Indian ministers visited all \r\n54 partner countries during that period. We have also \r\nhad 32 incoming visits by African Heads of State and \r\nGovernment, in addition to the landmark third India-\r\nAfrica Forum Summit, held in Delhi three years ago, in \r\nwhich all 54 African nations participated, including 41 \r\nAfrican Heads of State and Government. India has also \r\nengaged with the Group of 20 and the BRICS group, \r\ncomprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South \r\nAfrica, on issues concerning Africa’s development \r\npriorities.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating that India’s \r\npartnership with Africa is based on building instruments \r\nof empowerment for Africa. India stands together with \r\nAfrica in its endeavours, while upholding the principle \r\nof equality. In a similar spirit, we look forward to the \r\nHigh-level United Nations Conference on South-South \r\nCooperation on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for \r\nPromoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation \r\namong Developing Countries.\r\nLast year, here at the United Nations, India \r\nestablished the India-United Nations Development \r\nPartnership Fund, stepping up its efforts to promote \r\nSouth-South cooperation. A sum of $150 million has \r\nbeen committed for the next decade, the focus of which \r\nwill be development projects in least developed countries \r\nand small island developing States. In its first year, the \r\nFund has already initiated projects in nine countries in \r\nAfrica and will continue to enhance its outreach, which \r\ncontinues to contribute to the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063 and stands true to the \r\nprinciple of leaving no one behind.\r\nMs. Khyne (Myanmar): Myanmar aligns itself \r\nwith the statements made by the representatives of Viet \r\nNam, on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations, and of Egypt, on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China.\r\nI would like to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive reports \r\n(A/73/269, A/73/270 and A/73/273), which highlight the \r\nprogress, impact and challenges of African countries in \r\nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the African Union’s Agenda 2063, and \r\nprovide recommendations on the way forward for the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nMyanmar highly values relations with countries in \r\nAfrica. Myanmar was one of the leading countries that \r\norganized in 1955 the first Asia-Africa Conference, \r\nalso known as the Bandung Conference, to cultivate \r\ngreater friendship and cooperation between African \r\nand Asian countries. Myanmar also welcomed the \r\nNew Asian-African Strategic Partnership, which seeks \r\nto rekindle the spirit of friendship and cooperation \r\nbetween the two continents. Given its long-standing \r\nfriendship and relations with Africa, Myanmar attaches \r\ngreat importance to NEPAD and remains committed to \r\nits implementation aimed at achieving socioeconomic \r\ntransformation and development in Africa.\r\nMyanmar congratulates Africa on making great \r\nstrides in the economic and social fields over the past \r\nyears. We welcome the important progress towards \r\nthe implementation of several key areas of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, particularly in \r\ninfrastructure, agriculture and gender mainstreaming. \r\nAfrica’s gross domestic product growth rate rose to \r\n3 per cent in 2017, as compared to 1.7 per cent in 2016, \r\nand concrete steps are being taken in the health and \r\neducation sectors to advance progress in the social \r\nsphere. We appreciate the efforts made by our African \r\nfriends, in their respective national development \r\nframeworks, in mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the African Union’s \r\nAgenda 2063, which has started to bear fruitful results. \r\nMyanmar welcomes the launch this year of the Single \r\nAfrican Air Transport Market and the establishment \r\nof the African Continental Free Trade Area. Myanmar \r\nhopes that the creation of such intra-African trade will \r\ngenerate dynamic economic gains and a more resilient \r\nAfrican economy.\r\nNotwithstanding those positive developments, \r\nAfrica still needs to overcome persistent and emerging \r\nchallenges. The progress we have witnessed is clearly \r\nnot enough. In order to accelerate the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063 and to achieve our \r\ncommon goal of sustainable development, the African \r\ncountries and the international community need to \r\nintensify their collective efforts. I wish to highlight \r\nsome points towards that end.\r\nAdequate and predictable financing is indispensable \r\nfor the successful implementation of those Agendas \r\nif no one is to be left behind. Financing remains a \r\ngrowing challenge, even though bilateral aid to Africa \r\nincreased in 2017. Efforts therefore need to be made \r\nto increase official development assistance to African \r\ncountries, in line with the pledges made. We need to \r\nfoster a closer partnership between Africa and the \r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 17/28\r\ninternational community, including the United Nations \r\nsystem. Cooperation in the areas of trade, investment, \r\ntechnology transfer, debt relief and addressing illicit \r\nfinancial f lows is crucial to supporting African \r\ncountries in the implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. We also need to promote South-\r\nSouth and triangular cooperation for the development \r\nof Africa, while complementing relations with its \r\ntraditional development partners.\r\nThe United Nations system continues to play a \r\npivotal role in realizing the priorities of the African \r\nUnion and NEPAD at both the global and the regional \r\nlevels by providing substantial support to programmes \r\nand projects for the inclusive and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of Africa. My delegation hopes that the \r\nrepositioning of the United Nations development system \r\nwill further enhance the capacities of African countries \r\nin their pursuit of sustainable development.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate Myanmar’s strong \r\ncommitment to working closely with our African \r\nfriends to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and Agenda 2063. I also wish to reaffirm \r\nour friendship and solidarity with Africa. Together, we \r\nwill achieve a better future that leaves no one behind.\r\nMr. Stefanile (Italy): Italy aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered by the observer of the European \r\nUnion, and would like to add a few remarks in its \r\nnational capacity.\r\nWe welcome the latest report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/73/269) on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which outlines the progress \r\nmade by the African countries in the implementation \r\nof the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the United \r\nNations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nThe report shows that African countries continue \r\nto make important advancements in implementing \r\nNEPAD’s priorities, particularly in infrastructure, \r\nagriculture, education, gender mainstreaming and \r\npublic governance. Among those positive developments, \r\nwhich we sincerely commend, the establishment of the \r\nAfrican Continental Free Trade Area stands out as a \r\nparticularly significant achievement that could create \r\nmomentum towards continental integration and help \r\nto achieve the African Union’s vision of an integrated, \r\npeaceful and prosperous Africa. At the same time, the \r\nSecretary-General’s report analyses the challenges that \r\nmust still be addressed, including the need to build \r\nsustainable partnerships with international actors.\r\nItaly stands ready to work in that direction together \r\nwith its African partners. Because of its history, \r\ngeography and cultural traditions, Italy has always had \r\na strong and profound relationship with Africa. Over \r\nthe years, we have invested significant resources in the \r\nfuture of the continent, with an integrated approach \r\nencompassing humanitarian assistance, development \r\ncooperation and private investments. Our action has \r\nalways been and remains inspired by the following \r\nprinciples: African ownership in defining development \r\npriorities, transparency and shared responsibility.\r\nOur engagement has been consistent over the \r\nyears and is being scaled up. In 2018, the resources \r\nallocated for Africa by the Italian Development \r\nCooperation amount to €182 million — an increase of \r\n11.6 per cent, as compared to last year. More generally, \r\nItaly is assisting with training and capacity-building \r\nprogrammes in many parts of Africa, from Libya \r\nto the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, in various areas \r\nidentified in agreement with the local authorities and \r\nwith full respect for the principle of African ownership. \r\nItaly’s engagement is particularly strong in the Horn \r\nof Africa. Last week, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte \r\nvisited Ethiopia and Eritrea in order to express concrete \r\nsupport for the normalization process being carried \r\nforward by the leaders in Addis Ababa and Asmara, \r\nwhich we are confident will also result in better \r\ndevelopment prospects for the two countries and the \r\nrest of the region.\r\nThe Sahel has also become a priority for us. Italy \r\nstrongly supports the revitalization of the United \r\nNations integrated strategy for the Sahel and is \r\nparticularly pleased to see that the United Nations \r\nSupport Plan for the Sahel is moving forward. From a \r\nbilateral point of view, we have expanded our presence \r\nin the region through the opening of new embassies \r\nin Niamey, Conakry and, soon, Ouagadougou. Italy \r\nhas also traditionally put African development at the \r\nforefront of its action in major multilateral forums. \r\nDuring our presidency of the Group of Seven in \r\n2017, we focused on increasing collective support for \r\nfood security and nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa \r\nand dedicated the outreach session of the Group of \r\nSeven summit specifically to the African continent. \r\nIn the framework of the Group of 20, we have been \r\nactively participating in the Compact with Africa, an \r\ninitiative launched by the 2017 German presidency, \r\nwhich is aimed at promoting private investment in 11 \r\nAfrican countries.\r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n18/28 18-32548\r\nWe believe in the need for a stronger involvement \r\nof the private sector in order for African development \r\nto be sustainable in the long term. Already one of \r\nthe largest investors in Africa, Italy has increasingly \r\nbeen engaging its private sector in the creation of \r\nmulti-stakeholder partnerships in Africa, especially \r\nwith a view to promoting greater and better access to \r\nsustainable energy.\r\nI take the opportunity to highlight the fact that the \r\nsecond Italy-Africa Ministerial Conference — which \r\nrepresents a structured framework of the partnership \r\nestablished between Italy and Africa — will take \r\nplace in Rome on 24 and 25 October. That high-level \r\nmeeting, the second of which is now being held, will \r\nenable us to strengthen our dialogue and cooperation \r\nwith Africa in many areas. It will focus on Africa’s \r\neconomic growth, our concerted efforts to foster peace \r\non the continent, and the promotion of human-capital \r\ndevelopment. There will also be the opportunity to \r\ndiscuss how the Italian business model — based on \r\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises — can help in \r\ndeveloping African entrepreneurship.\r\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming Italy’s \r\ncommitment to move forward its partnership with the \r\nAfrican countries in pursuing the objectives set out \r\nin Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda and in making \r\nfurther and steady progress in the implementation of \r\nthe NEPAD priorities. Our long-term engagement \r\nalongside the African continent is and will remain \r\na priority.\r\nMs. Guadey (Ethiopia): At the outset, allow me \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive \r\nreports under this agenda item (A/73/269, A/73/270 \r\nand A/73/273). I would like to associate my delegation \r\nwith the statements delivered by the representatives of \r\nMorocco and Egypt on behalf of the Group of African \r\nStates and the Group of 77 and China, respectively.\r\nSince the beginning of this century, Africa has \r\ncontinued to see encouraging economic growth \r\nresulting in the reduction of poverty. However, the \r\ncontinent still faces multiple development challenges \r\nowing, inter alia, to the lack of structural economic \r\ntransformation and regional integration. As a result, \r\nin 2015, African leaders endorsed Agenda 2063 with \r\nan unwavering political commitment to building an \r\nintegrated, prosperous and peaceful continent that plays \r\nits rightful role at the global level. The African Union’s \r\nAgenda 2063 demonstrates the will and readiness of \r\nAfricans to shape the destiny of the continent by forging \r\npartnerships with domestic and external partners.\r\nIn that regard, by mainstreaming Agenda \r\n2063, particularly its first 10-year plan, into their \r\ndevelopment priorities, African countries have been \r\nimplementing national, regional and continental \r\ndevelopment initiatives. The establishment of the \r\nAfrican Continental Free Trade Area is an important \r\nachievement that seeks, inter alia, to promote regional \r\nintegration by increasing the value of intra-African \r\ntrade. African countries, including Ethiopia, have \r\nalso continued to mobilize domestic resources so as \r\nto finance their development programmes. Similarly, \r\nthe implementation plans of the national, regional and \r\ncontinental strategies include actions to adapt to and \r\nmitigate the negative impacts of climate change.\r\nWhile implementing Agenda 2063 is primarily the \r\nresponsibility of African countries, we believe that, in \r\nan interconnected world where we have committed to \r\nrevitalizing global partnerships through internationally \r\nagreed development frameworks, supporting Africa \r\nis the right thing to do in order to demonstrate global \r\nsolidarity and cooperation in a practical way. In that \r\nconnection, as outlined in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport on NEPAD (A/73/269), we appreciate all our \r\nbilateral and multilateral development partners for \r\ntheir continued support for the implementation of \r\nAgenda 2063.\r\nIn that regard, we commend the cooperation \r\nbetween the African Union and the United Nations, \r\nwhich is aimed at coordinating the follow-up and \r\nreporting mechanisms of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 \r\nAgenda. We also believe that the United Nations-\r\nAfrican Union cooperation and coordination should be \r\nfurther consolidated so as to achieve both development \r\nframeworks in accordance with national and \r\nregional initiatives.\r\nWe underscore that Agenda 2063 and the 2030 \r\nAgenda have been fashioned in a coherent manner so as \r\nto support Africa’s sustainable development. Africa’s \r\nefforts should therefore be supported by coordinated \r\nglobal actions so that the continent is not left behind. \r\nAfrica remains the litmus test for the success of \r\nthe international community in implementing the \r\nSustainable Development Goals and targets. Ethiopia \r\nremains committed to contributing to the realization of \r\nthe vision of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda in line \r\nwith its development priorities.\r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 19/28\r\nPeace is an essential prerequisite for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment. Much has been achieved by the continent \r\nas it works to strengthen the capacities for structural \r\nconflict prevention in Africa. The operationalization of \r\nthe African Peace and Security Architecture represents \r\nnotable progress towards further strengthening African-\r\nled efforts to prevent conflicts and to address their root \r\ncauses. Africa is indeed driving its own agenda and \r\nrising to meet its peace challenges.\r\nSignificant advancements has been made with \r\nregard to regional cooperation and integration. The \r\nimplementation of the African Union’s master road map \r\nof practical steps for silencing the guns in Africa by \r\n2020 is also under way. The role of the United Nations \r\nsystem, which is focused mainly on supporting peace \r\nand security and good governance and on initiatives \r\nand actions aimed at contributing to addressing the root \r\ncauses of conflict on the continent, is also commendable. \r\nBut one crucial matter is the collaboration at various \r\nlevels between the United Nations and the African \r\nUnion on the basis of comparative advantages in \r\nworking towards a greater unity of purpose.\r\nMember States have the primary responsibility \r\nfor conflict prevention, and that prevention depends \r\nultimately on their capacity to build resilience to \r\nviolent conflicts, strengthen local capacities to \r\nbuild and sustain peace, and promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment. To that end, Ethiopia has opened a new \r\nchapter in its political and social history, offering \r\nrealistic and genuine possibilities for change that will \r\nmeet the hopes and expectations of our citizens and \r\nensure that those changes are in line with the new \r\npolitical and democratic realities in the country, with \r\nthe ultimate goal of creating a just, peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable society.\r\nAnother highly important and historic development \r\nis taking place in our subregion. A real process of \r\nnormalization of relations between and among the \r\ncountries of the Horn of Africa has been launched. In \r\nthe light of those important and positive developments, \r\nit is appropriate and timely for the United Nations \r\nto seriously consider how to support and maintain \r\nthose efforts.\r\nLet me conclude by underlining that Ethiopia is, and \r\nwill always remain, firmly committed to making every \r\npossible effort towards creating peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies in our subregion and on the \r\nAfrican continent.\r\nMr. Boukadoum (Algeria): The joint debate on the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\nin the General Assembly is, as we all know, very \r\nimportant to the continent, and my country cherishes \r\nthis opportunity to share its views with the entire \r\nmembership. The NEPAD Agency remains the technical \r\narm of the African Union (AU), in coordination with \r\nthe other structures of the Union and with regional \r\neconomic communities.\r\nI would like to start by saying that, in addition to \r\naligning ourselves with the statements delivered by \r\nthe representatives of Egypt and Morocco, speaking \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China and the Group \r\nof African States, respectively, I would like to add the \r\nfollowing remarks.\r\nWe note with deep appreciation most of the \r\nfindings and recommendations contained in the three \r\nreports of the Secretary-General, namely, the latest \r\nreport on NEPAD (A/73/269), the report on the causes \r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/73/273), and the \r\nbiennial report on the review of the implementation of \r\nthe commitments made towards Africa’s development \r\n(A/73/270).\r\nI first wish to thank the Office of the Special \r\nAdviser on Africa for the dedication and valuable work \r\nof Ms. Bience Gawanas and her team in enhancing \r\ninternational support for Africa’s development. I \r\nalso wish to commend the work of the Economic \r\nCommission for Africa in that regard and call for \r\nenhanced cooperation with the African Union on those \r\nand other issues.\r\nRegarding the report entitled “New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development: sixteenth consolidated progress \r\nreport on implementation and international support”, \r\nwe consider its findings encouraging, as it shows the \r\ncontinued progress being made by African countries in \r\nthe implementation of NEPAD’s priorities, particularly \r\nin the areas of infrastructure, agriculture, education, \r\ngender mainstreaming and governance.\r\nWith regard to the actions being taken by African \r\ncountries and organizations, we agree that infrastructure \r\nis an enabler for the continent’s industrialization \r\nand regional integration. It is a positive development \r\nthat the NEPAD Agency is hosting the project on the \r\nimplementation of the African Integrated High-Speed \r\nRailway Network, which aims to interconnect all \r\nAfrican capitals. There are currently ideas to connect \r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n20/28 18-32548\r\nSouth Africa with Algeria by rail — a project on \r\nwhich we have already made a start. It is now almost \r\npossible to drive from Algiers to Lagos as a result of the \r\nTrans-Sahara Highway project, which aims to connect \r\nmore than 400 million people spread across 6 million \r\nsquare kilometres. Health issues are also crucial, and \r\nwe welcome the fact that 12 of the 55 member States of \r\nthe African Union have reviewed, or are in the process \r\nof reviewing, their domestic laws on the regulation \r\nof medicines, in line with the African Union’s model \r\nlaw. We hope that more countries will undertake that \r\nalignment process in the coming years.\r\nWe strongly appreciate the fact that the NEPAD \r\nAgency continues to support the efforts of African \r\ncountries to achieve gender parity in education and \r\nthe implementation of gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment at the national, regional and subregional \r\nlevels. Algeria is among the leaders of its region on \r\nthat issue. As for the response of the international \r\ncommunity, I note with some concern that data on \r\nofficial development assistance to Africa in 2017 was \r\nnot available at the time of reporting. Let me insist on \r\nthe importance of having that data in the next NEPAD \r\nreports. The available data on Africa in the report \r\nshows a 1.3 per cent decrease in official development \r\nassistance in 2016. We hope that the most recent data \r\nwill be more positive.\r\nWe agree that, in the light of the persistent \r\nimbalances in African labour markets and the high youth \r\nunemployment, African countries must take measures \r\nto equip students with the requisite skills and training \r\nneeded for today’s labour markets. Youth employment \r\nis an important component of preventing conflicts.\r\nThat brings me to the report on the causes of conflict \r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa. That report indicates that the \r\npast two decades have witnessed remarkable progress \r\nand the emergence of a new African narrative in all \r\nareas. Africa is driving its own agenda in rising to \r\nmeet the challenges it faces with regard to peace and \r\ndevelopment, and we believe that that achievement is \r\ncertainly the result of the African Union’s outstanding \r\nefforts. The United Nations and development partners \r\nhave also contributed to that success.\r\nWe note with appreciation that the Peacebuilding \r\nFund has provided seed funding for some components \r\nof the United Nations Support Plan for the Sahel (2018-\r\n2022). We would be very interested in having in the \r\nnext report information on what the United Nations \r\nand development partners are doing to support the \r\nimplementation of the Agreement on Peace and \r\nReconciliation in Mali emanating from the Algiers \r\nprocess. We invite the Secretary-General to shed \r\nlight on that aspect in his next report. We concur that \r\nconflict prevention is ultimately about the capability of \r\nMember States to build resilience to violent conflicts. \r\nThe United Nations, the AU and the regional economic \r\ncommunities, along with their respective mechanisms, \r\nplay a tremendous role in the efforts to develop \r\ncomprehensive and coherent conflict-prevention \r\nstrategies and tools of countries in that regard.\r\nIt is imperative for the AU, NEPAD, the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism, the African Development \r\nBank and the regional economic communities to \r\nenhance their work on conflict prevention. The newly \r\nestablished United Nations-AU annual conference, the \r\ndesk-to-desk consultations, the Regional Coordination \r\nMechanism for Africa and the United Nations \r\ninterdepartmental task force on African affairs \r\nprovide useful platforms for improving consultations, \r\ninformation exchange and joint planning in our efforts \r\nto foster coordinated support for Africa’s peace and \r\ndevelopment priorities.\r\nRegarding the third report, which deals with \r\nimpacts and challenges in four thematic areas that \r\nare critical to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063 of the \r\nAfrican Union, namely, industrialization and regional \r\nintegration, health, water and sanitation, climate \r\nchange and financing for sustainable development, I \r\nwould first like to commend Africa’s traditional, new \r\nand emerging development partners. We agree with \r\nalmost all the conclusions and recommendations in \r\nthe report. However, regarding the health, water and \r\nsanitation recommendations to development partners, \r\nwe wonder why the scaling-up of long-term, predictable \r\nand sustainable health financing is limited only to \r\nSouth-South cooperation. We believe that that should \r\nbe broadened to all forms of international cooperation. \r\nOn financing for development, we echo the need for \r\ndevelopment partners to increase official development \r\nassistance to Africa, in line with the scale of the \r\nchallenges facing the continent.\r\nThanks to its immense potential in both human \r\nand natural resources, Africa is the future of the world. \r\nAfrica is a thriving continent that is on the right track, \r\ndespite real and evident setbacks and uncertainties. \r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 21/28\r\nAfrica now needs to jump-start its development, \r\nand it has started to do that thanks to many national, \r\nregional and continental endeavours. Africa needs to \r\nbe respected and viewed as a partner, not as a source \r\nof problems or a threat to others. History shows that \r\nthe whole world still has an obligation towards the \r\ncontinent to work to repair its problems. Cooperation, \r\nmutual respect, genuine partnership and solidarity are \r\nneeded more than ever.\r\nMs. Skåre (Norway): There are many reasons to \r\nbe optimistic about the future of Africa. Good progress \r\nhas been made in achieving the goals set out in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063 \r\nof the African Union (AU). The African Continental \r\nFree Trade Area holds promise for stimulating \r\ncontinued and inclusive growth. Serious challenges \r\nremain, however, and here I wish to underscore the \r\nimportance of job creation, particularly for women and \r\nyoung people.\r\nWe must step up our support for those in the greatest \r\nneed, and in order to achieve our common goals we \r\nneed to intensify our cooperation with our partners \r\nin Africa. Regional and subregional organizations \r\nplay a crucial role in helping us to find sustainable \r\nsolutions for our shared future. On 1 October, Norway \r\nopened its Permanent Mission to the African Union \r\nin Addis Ababa. Norway is honoured to support the \r\nAU-led training for incoming African members of the \r\nSecurity Council and the AU office in New York. We \r\nsee ourselves as a consistent and reliable partner. For \r\nmore than 10 years, Norway has allocated 1 per cent \r\nof its gross national income to official development \r\nassistance. Development assistance continues to be an \r\nimportant component of our cooperation with countries \r\nin Africa. However, trade, private investments and \r\nbusiness cooperation have now become increasingly \r\nprominent parts of our partnerships, which is a very \r\npromising and inspiring trend.\r\nWe share with Africa the challenges posed by illicit \r\nfinancial f lows, and we commend the good work done \r\nin that regard in Africa. We particularly commend \r\nNigeria for the leading role it has taken in the fight \r\nagainst illicit financial f lows, and we are proud to be \r\npartners in that important work. We share the priority of \r\nensuring gender equality. Women’s participation in all \r\nsectors of society benefits our economies and societies. \r\nAllow me to especially congratulate Ethiopia on the \r\ngender parity in its new Government. That country is \r\nleading the way.\r\nIn his twentieth annual report on the causes of \r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/73/273), the \r\nSecretary-General advocates the strengthening of \r\ncapacities for structural conflict prevention. We \r\nalign ourselves with that important message, and we \r\nwelcome the notable progress on the operationalization \r\nof the African Peace and Security Architecture. \r\nNorway stands ready to contribute to the prevention of \r\nconflicts and to addressing their root causes. Through \r\nour partnerships, Norway will continue to contribute to \r\ngood solutions for our common future.\r\nMr. Arrocha Ruíz (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nPanama welcomes this debate, which constitutes a \r\nsignificant effort to stimulate effective dialogue on \r\nglobal cooperation for the development of the African \r\ncontinent — a topic that demands the commitment of us \r\nall. My delegation aligns itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Egypt on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China.\r\nI would like particularly to emphasize the value \r\nof the reports of the Secretary-General (A/73/269. \r\nA/73/270 and A/73/273), which put into perspective the \r\nprogress made by African countries in fulfilling their \r\npriorities within the framework of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) — a strategy that \r\nseeks to tackle the great challenges of the region and \r\nenable the full-f ledged sustainable development of \r\nits population. We have set ourselves the challenge \r\nof leaving no one behind. Achieving that requires \r\ninnovative and mutually responsible leadership in order \r\nto ensure that such well-being is enjoyed by all, fairly \r\nand without discrimination, aimed at attaining more \r\npeaceful and inclusive societies.\r\nPanama recognizes the significance of the existing \r\nlink between the African Union’s Agenda 2063: The \r\nAfrica We Want and the United Nations 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. We congratulate the \r\nefforts of African countries to include the priorities of \r\nboth Agendas in their national development frameworks \r\nin a coordinated way. We also commend the progress \r\nmade in terms of integration through the establishment \r\nof the African Continental Free Trade Area, the \r\naccomplishment of which also marks the ideal way to \r\nattain an integrated, peaceful and prosperous region.\r\nThe challenges that Africa continues to face \r\nare not insignificant, namely, the need to overcome \r\narmed conflicts, consolidate peace processes and \r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n22/28 18-32548\r\naddress issues of human rights, health and education, \r\namong others. However, we are confident of Africa’s \r\npotential to drive its own development so as to ensure \r\na safe, prosperous and peaceful continent with strong \r\ninstitutions. We also trust that the Africa Dialogue \r\nSeries, held in recent days, yielded valuable results \r\nin strengthening the strategic alliance that must be \r\nmaintained between the United Nations and the African \r\nUnion. There is no doubt that the role played by regional \r\ninstitutions provides a platform of unique importance \r\nin ensuring the success of the development agenda.\r\nThroughout the current decade, Africa has \r\nstriven to maximize the results of its regional agenda, \r\nwhich is laudable. We welcome the third Industrial \r\nDevelopment Decade for Africa, as well as its efforts \r\nto achieve the rollback of malaria and to increase \r\nagricultural productivity and food security. In addition, \r\nin 2010, Africa marked the beginning of the African \r\nWomen’s Decade, and we have seen an increase in the \r\nparticipation of women in leadership roles — such as \r\nDeputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed and \r\nMs. Graça Machel, to name only two. We therefore \r\ncommend all efforts to achieve gender equality and \r\nthe empowerment of women and girls. My country \r\nfirmly believes that the participation of women is a \r\nfundamental element in attaining the full development \r\nand progress of any country.\r\nThere is no doubt that the international community \r\nshould support, and must continue to support, African \r\ncountries in the socioeconomic transformation of \r\ntheir continent. To that end, cooperation among States \r\nand through multisectoral partnerships that address \r\nstrategic areas prioritized by Africans is vital and \r\nmandatory. My country firmly believes in the strong \r\nties between development and security, stressing \r\nthat there can be no development without peace, nor \r\npeace without development. The responsibility of this \r\nOrganization, and the Security Council in particular, \r\nshould be to serve as the fulcrum in the prevention of \r\nconflicts. For that reason, we commend the efforts of \r\nAfrican countries to promote and foster constructive \r\ndialogue mechanisms with all segments of society. \r\nWe urge those countries to continue their work in the \r\narea of  conflict prevention and to implement initiatives \r\naimed at preventing conflicts at all stages by tackling \r\ntheir root causes in a timely manner.\r\nMindful of the fact that the construction of a peaceful \r\nand safe world is a shared global responsibility, Panama \r\nhas been expanding and strengthening its relations with \r\nother regions of the world, and, as part of our foreign \r\npolicy priorities, we have launched the so-called Falcon \r\nPolicy, through which we seek to further strengthen our \r\npolitical ties of friendship, fraternity and cooperation \r\nwith Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In that regard \r\nand as a middle-income country offering cooperation, \r\nwe make ourselves available to African countries to \r\nserve as a resource for the exchange of knowledge and \r\ngood practices, abiding by the criterion of solidarity \r\nand with a view to contributing to the achievement of \r\nour shared development goals.\r\nI would like to conclude by remembering two \r\nsons of Africa and citizens of the world, namely, \r\nNelson Mandela and Kofi Annan, who both dreamt of \r\nan African continent in peace and with full-f ledged \r\ndevelopment. I reiterate Panama’s support and solidarity \r\nin contributing to the full and effective implementation \r\nof the commitments made for the development of Africa \r\nand its people.\r\nMr. Elnour (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his important reports before us (A/73/269, \r\nA/73/270 and A/73/273), as well as the substantial \r\nrecommendations therein.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representative of the Kingdom of Morocco \r\non behalf of the Group of African States and by the \r\nrepresentative of the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China. I would like to add the \r\nfollowing points in my national capacity.\r\nWe note that the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/73/269) on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) includes the positive \r\ndevelopments that have taken place during the \r\nreporting period. Among the most important of those \r\ndevelopments are the inauguration in March of the \r\nAfrican Continental Free Trade Area and the continent’s \r\neconomic growth rate of 3.6 per cent in 2017, as well \r\nas the enhanced cooperation among African States \r\nto implement NEPAD, particularly in the fields of \r\ninfrastructure, agriculture, gender mainstreaming, \r\nthe environment and climate change, information and \r\ncommunications technology, education and training, \r\namong other important fields.\r\nIn that regard, we recall the many developments \r\nrelated to achieving the purposes and objectives \r\nof NEPAD, most importantly the recent positive \r\ndevelopments in the Horn of Africa and the \r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 23/28\r\nnormalization of relations among the countries of the \r\nregion, as well as the revitalized Agreement on the \r\nResolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South \r\nSudan. The Agreement was signed in Addis Ababa \r\non 12 September by the parties to the conflict in the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan, thanks to the efforts of the \r\nSudan in the context of the Intergovernmental Authority \r\non Development initiative for peace in South Sudan. \r\nThe relevant stakeholders have begun the necessary \r\npreparations to implement the Agreement.\r\nWith regard to the Central African Republic, \r\nefforts are currently under way to hold a new round of \r\nnegotiations among the relevant parties in Khartoum in \r\nNovember, following the negotiations that took place \r\nin August, all within the framework of the African \r\nUnion (AU) initiative for peace and reconciliation in \r\nthe Central African Republic. All those efforts are \r\nbeing made in the broader context of the AU initiative \r\nto silence the guns across Africa by 2020. That would \r\nenable African countries to dedicate their financial \r\nand human resources to achieving the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063 of the \r\nAfrican Union, to which we aspire.\r\nWe note the important information contained in \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on NEPAD to the effect \r\nthat the African continent is in need of $130 billion to \r\n$170 billion annually for investment in infrastructure \r\nprojects. However, the current projects represent just \r\n5 per cent of Africa’s overall investment needs, which \r\nshould prompt us to step up international and regional \r\nefforts to address that large gap in order to ensure that \r\nno one is left behind in terms of development.\r\nWe also note that, despite the significant economic \r\ngrowth rate realized in Africa, which in the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General is estimated to be approximately \r\n3.6 per cent in 2017, Africa continues to face multiple \r\nchallenges, including poverty, youth unemployment, \r\nincome disparity among African communities, climate \r\nchange, debt burden and population growth. That \r\narray of challenges is hampering the development of \r\nthe continent.\r\nWe would like to recall the importance of \r\nsupporting the efforts of the AU and regional economic \r\ncommunities to achieve economic integration on the \r\ncontinent, strengthen commercial trade and investment \r\namong African States, and strengthen the role of the \r\nAU in achieving peace and security in Africa, in the \r\ncontext of attaining African solutions to the continent’s \r\nproblems. In that regard, we commend the AU initiative \r\nto establish a fund for supporting peace and security, \r\nwhich aims to provide 25 per cent of the budgets for \r\nAfrican peacekeeping operations.\r\nWe stress the importance of enhancing African \r\nownership and leadership of the efforts to address the \r\nchallenges facing the continent. It is also important \r\nto strengthen coordination between the AU and other \r\npartners, States and organizations, as well as to \r\npromote partnership between the AU and the private \r\nsector, civil society, academics, the media and Africans \r\nin diaspora, who, as a group, constitute the fifth region \r\nof the African continent. We also support the reforms \r\nundertaken by the AU, as well as the partnership \r\nbetween the AU and the United Nations in the areas \r\nof peace, security and development. We call for the \r\nimplementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of \r\nthe Third International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and for investing in conflict resolution \r\nin Africa. It is important to strengthen coordination \r\nbetween the United Nations and its agencies that work \r\non the continent, while seeking to promote capacity-\r\nbuilding, technology transfer and the exchange of \r\nexperiences and best development practices.\r\nTo conclude, my delegation underlines that the \r\ninternational community has significant vital interests \r\nin Africa, and that supporting the continent’s efforts \r\nto achieve sustainable development and fulfil the \r\n2030 Agenda would reap benefits for all. We stress \r\npartnerships for the future, which would benefit \r\neveryone in the areas of investments, trade exchange, \r\nachieving peace and security, fighting terrorism, \r\ncombating drugs, terrorism and illicit migration, \r\ntransnational crime, sustainable environment and other \r\ncrucial areas. We all can accomplish those noble goals if \r\nwe work, cooperate and coordinate together according \r\nto a clear vision.\r\nMr. Hoshino (Japan): There is no denying \r\nthat Japan finds itself geographically far from the \r\nAfrican continent. However, in today’s globalized \r\nworld, irrespective of our location, we share common \r\nchallenges, common successes and a common future. \r\nTherefore, Africa’s peace and prosperity are our peace \r\nand prosperity, and our peace and prosperity are those \r\nof Africa. In that spirit, in 1993, the Government of \r\nJapan launched the Tokyo International Conference on \r\nAfrican Development (TICAD).\r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n24/28 18-32548\r\nTICAD is a process realized through the active \r\nparticipation of African countries, as well as a strong \r\npartnership with the United Nations, represented by the \r\nUnited Nations Office of the Special Adviser on Africa \r\nand the United Nations Development Programme, \r\nthe African Union Commission and the World Bank. \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express our \r\nsincere appreciation for that strong partnership, without \r\nwhich TICAD could not succeed.\r\nInclusiveness, a focus on Africa’s ownership and \r\nstrong follow-up mechanisms to ensure the concrete \r\nimplementation of commitments are the three notable \r\nfeatures of TICAD. The TICAD process is also aligned \r\nwith the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the African Union’s Agenda 2063 through its \r\nfocus on the peace, development and humanitarian \r\nnexus, as well as its people-centred and human security \r\napproach. We believe that TICAD makes significant \r\ncontributions to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nand Agenda 2063.\r\nAt the latest TICAD ministerial meeting held \r\nin Tokyo earlier this month, it was agreed that \r\ninternational support should comply with international \r\nstandards, taking into account the sustainability of \r\nthe debt of the recipient countries. That echoes a point \r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report entitled \r\n“New Partnership for Africa’s Development: sixteenth \r\nconsolidated progress report on implementation and \r\ninternational support” (A/73/269). In addition, the \r\nparticipants agreed on the need for private investment \r\nin order to diversify Africa’s economies, in particular its \r\nindustries, and to develop high-quality infrastructure. \r\nThey also agreed on the importance of realizing \r\nuniversal health coverage. Based on the outcomes of the \r\nTICAD ministerial meeting, Japan intends to accelerate \r\nits preparations to host the next TICAD summit, known \r\nas TICAD VII, which will take place in August next \r\nyear. I urge delegations to mark their calendars.\r\nThis week, we appreciated the launch of the \r\nAfrica Dialogue Series 2018 as an opportunity to \r\ndeepen discussions on the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda and Agenda 2063 and on operationalizing \r\nthe frameworks for partnerships between the United \r\nNations and the African Union. It has also provided us \r\nwith invaluable inspiration for TICAD VII.\r\nWe look forward to further consolidating our \r\npartnerships with African countries, international and \r\nsubregional organizations and all other stakeholders, \r\nincluding civil society and the private sector, in order \r\nrealize the Africa we want, which is a necessary \r\ncomponent of the world we all want.\r\nMrs. Pobee (Ghana): My delegation thanks the \r\nSecretary-General for the excellent reports he has \r\nsubmitted under this agenda item (А/73/269, А/73/270 \r\nand А/73/273), and commends the Special Adviser on \r\nAfrica and her team for the successful launch of the \r\nAfrica Dialogue Series and for facilitating the rich \r\nexchange of views on the critical issues of concern to \r\nAfrica over the past two days.\r\nGhana aligns itself with the statements delivered \r\nby the representatives of Morocco and Egypt on behalf \r\nof the Group of African States and the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, respectively.\r\nAfrica’s development priorities have been clearly \r\nexpressed in several continental and global landmark \r\nagreements, the most significant being Agenda \r\n2063: The Africa We Want, a strategic vision for \r\ntransformative development in Africa, and the 10-\r\nyear implementation plan (2014-2023), which hold the \r\npromise of contributing to the enhancement of inclusive \r\neconomic and social progress. The emphasis of Agenda \r\n2063 on agriculture development, infrastructure \r\ndevelopment and industrialization will greatly facilitate \r\njob creation and poverty eradication on the continent.\r\nEqually transformative is the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, which derives many of its \r\ngoals and targets from the African Union’s Agenda \r\n2063 and which, together with the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda of the Third International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development, provides a comprehensive \r\nframework for action in the spirit of global partnership \r\nand solidarity.\r\nMy delegation is particularly pleased that, in the \r\npast year, the African Union has concluded several \r\nmajor continental agreements, including the Africa \r\nContinental Free Trade Area, the Single African Air \r\nTransport Market and the continent-wide protocol on \r\nthe free movement of people, all of which are important \r\npillars of Agenda 2063 and a sign of the collective resolve \r\nand determination of Africans to create the conditions \r\nnecessary for the realization of the continental vision of \r\nsocioeconomic transformation.\r\nAfrica has demonstrated leadership in the \r\ndevelopment of the continent and is charting the \r\ncontinent’s path to prosperity. The sense of enterprise, \r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 25/28\r\ncreativity, innovation and hard work needed to engineer \r\nsuch a transition are already at work, and what is \r\nrequired is coherence and complementarity among \r\nglobal, continental, regional, national and local efforts \r\nfor effective implementation.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation welcomes the renewed \r\nefforts of the Planning and Coordinating Agency of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\nto strengthen national and regional capacities to \r\ncoordinate the implementation of the Agendas. We also \r\nwish to underscore the important work of the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism in fostering good governance \r\nas an enabler of growth and sustainable development.\r\nThe African Union-United Nations Framework \r\nfor the Implementation of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in \r\nJanuary, is a significant development. Similarly, the \r\nJoint United Nations-African Union Framework for \r\nan Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security will \r\npromote sustaining peace as an important prerequisite \r\nfor sustainable development. We urge continued \r\ncollaboration on the implementation of strategies \r\nand programmes that promote the comprehensive \r\ndevelopment of Africa.\r\nAs rightly indicated in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport on NEPAD, global economic conditions have a \r\nconsiderable bearing on the performance of African \r\neconomies and, consequently, on the pace of progress in \r\nthe implementation of the Agendas. Building resilience \r\nwill be necessary in order to sustain our efforts.\r\nFinancing is a critical element for the achievement \r\nof development. As African countries redouble their \r\nefforts to mobilize domestic resources, we call on \r\npartners to fulfil their official development assistance \r\ncommitments to complement those efforts. We also \r\ncall for urgent international action to help curb illicit \r\nfinancial f lows from Africa.\r\nWe take note that, as foreign direct investment \r\n(FDI) f lows to Africa have continued their downward \r\ntrend, Africa’s new and emerging development partners \r\nhave made significant commitments in terms of FDI and \r\nother support, ranging from trade in natural resources \r\nto agriculture and construction. We welcome those \r\npartnerships, together with the launch of the Group \r\nof 20 Africa Partnership in July 2017, and hope that \r\ncooperation with the continent will be strengthened, \r\nwith Agenda 2063 as its guiding framework. \r\nWhile commending our partners for those tangible \r\ncontributions, we reaffirm the importance of the \r\nrole of the private sector, as well as that of public-\r\nprivate partnerships, in meeting the challenges of \r\nsustainable development.\r\nBoth the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the African Union’s Agenda 2063 recognize \r\nthe importance of peace and stability, not only as \r\ncritical enablers but also as important components of \r\nsustainable development. In line with that aspiration, \r\nAfrica has also continued, with the support of the United \r\nNations and development partners, to deal with current \r\nconflicts and to address emerging challenges to peace, \r\nsecurity and development, such as the rise of terrorism \r\nand violent extremism, as well as the growing number \r\nof migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons.\r\nWe reaffirm that sustaining peace is a particularly \r\npoignant goal in Africa, and the mutually reinforcing \r\nand interlinked pillars of peace, security, development \r\nand human rights must be reinforced in order to find \r\nlasting solutions to conflicts on the African continent. \r\nTackling the root causes of conflict, such as youth \r\nunemployment, inequality and economic and social \r\nexclusion, including through the African Peace and \r\nSecurity Architecture and the African Governance \r\nArchitecture, will be critical to Africa’s transformation.\r\nThe role of women in sustainable development \r\ncannot be overestimated. Equally important is their \r\nindispensable role in peacebuilding and sustaining \r\npeace. For that reason, Ghana welcomes the \r\ncollaboration between the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union aimed at enhancing women’s political \r\nleadership and participation in conflict prevention, \r\nresolution and peacebuilding through the support given \r\nto the African Women Leaders Network.\r\nDeliberate and targeted policies must be adopted \r\nby Governments with the goal of seeking ways to \r\npromote the inclusive participation of young people \r\nin development. The continent is a youthful one. That \r\nmakes it imperative to include young people in Africa’s \r\nefforts in a meaningful way, if we mean to achieve the \r\ngoals and targets of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I would like to begin by associating myself \r\nwith the statements delivered by the representatives of \r\nEgypt, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and of \r\nMorocco, on behalf of the Group of African States.\r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n26/28 18-32548\r\nI would also like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the three reports (A/73/269, A/73/270 and \r\nA/73/273) submitted under this agenda item. In those \r\nreports, the Secretary-General presents all the activities \r\ncarried out by African countries, their development \r\npartners and the United Nations system. He also focuses \r\non conflicts and the need for peace.\r\nWe commend all those contributions, and we \r\nthank Africa’s bilateral and multilateral partners for \r\ntheir much-appreciated efforts. Nevertheless, the fact \r\nremains that, owing to problems with coordination, \r\nproject finalization, resource mobilization and \r\nwithdrawal, those efforts have not always produced the \r\nexpected results. We must therefore redouble our efforts \r\nin a number of key areas in the future. That is why we \r\nendorse the Secretary-General’s recommendations, \r\nwhich highlight a fitting vision for sustainable \r\nprogress in Africa, with a focus on the following \r\nareas: sustainable and inclusive economic growth \r\nbased on industry, trade and regional integration; the \r\ndevelopment of infrastructure; investment in human \r\ncapital through measures in the fields of health care, \r\nscience, technology and innovation, social development, \r\nemployment, job creation, social protection, migration \r\nand mobility; action to promote women, gender \r\nequality and youth empowerment; humanitarian \r\nissues and disaster risk management; the environment, \r\nurbanization and population; and, lastly, advocacy, \r\ninformation, communication and culture.\r\nHaving embraced those strategic guidelines \r\nand despite an unfavourable economic situation, the \r\nGovernment of my country, through its strategic \r\ndocument for growth and employment, continues to \r\ncreate favourable conditions so that it can achieve the \r\ndesired goals in each of those areas. We have therefore \r\nfocused on entrepreneurship and the transformation \r\nof the informal sector, which provide niches for the \r\nempowerment of women and young people, with a view \r\nto fully integrating those groups into society.\r\nA bank for small and medium-sized enterprises \r\nhas been established. Further measures involve the \r\nefficient use of domestic resources through bonds, an \r\napproach that generates domestic savings to finance \r\ngrowth-generating projects. An investment-friendly \r\ncode and framework conducive to a transparent, stable \r\nand predictable business climate are in place in order \r\nto attract foreign direct investment, which is seen \r\nas one of the cornerstones of strong, sustainable and \r\ninclusive economic growth. Cameroon’s health system \r\nhas been considerably strengthened, and the transition \r\nto universal health coverage is well under way.\r\nIn recent years and in accordance with the Malabo \r\nDeclaration on Nutrition Security for Inclusive \r\nEconomic Growth and Sustainable Development in \r\nAfrica, the Government of Cameroon has committed \r\nto achieving the goal of food security and nutrition. \r\nHowever, my delegation regrets to note that that objective \r\nis seriously threatened by desertification, drought, the \r\nterrorism of the Boko Haram sect and instability in the \r\nsubregion, which requires an economically and socially \r\nburdensome management of refugees.\r\nWith regard to the multilateral and comprehensive \r\napproach to addressing common challenges, I would \r\nlike to point out that Cameroon is actively participating \r\nin the promotion and strengthening of trade and \r\nregional integration through numerous bodies, such \r\nas the Central African Economic and Monetary \r\nCommunity, the Economic Community of Central \r\nAfrican States, the Niger Basin Authority and the Lake \r\nChad Basin Commission. It has joined the agreement \r\nestablishing the African Continental Free Trade Area, \r\nwhich seeks to increase commercial trade in Africa. It \r\nparticipates in the implementation of numerous local and \r\nregional infrastructures that seek to strengthen regional \r\nand continental integration, such as a project — now \r\nwell under way — to build a railway linking the capital \r\nof Chad to the Cameroonian ports of Douala and Kribi. \r\nThose projects, currently at an advanced stage, are \r\nexpected to increase trade among the countries of the \r\nsubregion. Much of the road infrastructure linking the \r\nCameroonian capital to the capitals or large cities of \r\nneighbouring countries, which is either operational or \r\nin the process of becoming so, will considerably boost \r\nsubregional integration.\r\nCameroon is concerned about the increasing \r\nburden of African debt and the downward trend in \r\nofficial development assistance. In that context, we \r\ncan barely implement the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals in Africa. My country therefore calls on the \r\ninternational community to strengthen the capacities \r\nof the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) and to respect fair and equitable rules so that \r\nAfrican countries can access international trade and \r\nthe technologies needed for sustainable development.\r\nWe cannot emphasize enough that conflict \r\nprevention, management and resolution, as well as post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding, are crucial for the achievement \r\n19/10/2018 A/73/PV.23\r\n18-32548 27/28\r\nof NEPAD’s objectives with regard to development. Let \r\nus therefore address the root causes of conflict in Africa \r\nin order to enable the United Nations Peacebuilding \r\nCommission to fully support African countries \r\nemerging from conflict. There is a saying in Africa \r\nthat where peace is absent, destitution takes root, and \r\nwhere there is destitution, endless quarrels arise. There \r\nis therefore a cycle linking peace and development. \r\nIn other words, while we certainly cannot eat peace, \r\nwe also cannot eat when there is no peace. As such, \r\nsubstantial resources should be made available to the \r\nSecretary-General for those purposes.\r\nIt has been 16 years since Africa presented the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development to the world. \r\nThe international community embraced that new \r\npartnership with enthusiasm. It is on that basis that our \r\ncontinent built the new initiative for the development \r\nof our continent by 2063 — which was endorsed by the \r\nAssembly — along with its programmes for the first \r\n10 years. It is therefore clear that Africa knows what it \r\nwants, that it knows where it is going and that we know \r\nwhat must be done. We therefore call on all parties to \r\nrespect their commitments.\r\nThe United Nations, for its part, must strengthen \r\nthe coordination of its agencies responsible for \r\nimplementing the Organization’s contributions to \r\nthat programme. In particular, they must strengthen \r\nthe capacities of the Office of the Special Adviser on \r\nAfrica, as well as those of the Economic Commission \r\nfor Africa and its subregional structures, which play an \r\nimportant role in coordinating, planning — including \r\nstrategic planning — and programming, as well as \r\nin mobilizing resources and international opinion in \r\nsupport of Africa.\r\nMr. Bin Momen (Bangladesh): My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative \r\nof Egypt on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. We \r\nwould also like to make some additional remarks in our \r\nnational capacity.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his reports \r\nportraying the development scenario in Africa \r\n(A/73/269, A/73/270 and A/73/273). While they \r\ngenerate optimism regarding the overall rebound of the \r\nAfrican economy in 2017, one cannot miss their words \r\nof caution regarding Africa’s persistent development \r\nchallenges, for example, debt servicing, structural \r\nimpediments, factors causing environmental stress \r\nsuch as desertification, job creation and the investment \r\ndeficit, among others. The international community, \r\nand the United Nations in particular, must pay due \r\nattention to those areas.\r\nAs Chair of the Group of Least Developed \r\nCountries for the past three years, we have been \r\nparticularly conscious of the interests of the African \r\nleast developed countries. We have tried to highlight \r\nthe specific challenges that they face, such as in the \r\nsectors of structural transformation, information and \r\ncommunications technology infrastructure, social and \r\nhealth issues, resilience-building and crisis management \r\nand mitigation, inter alia. We have also pressed for \r\ntailored support for the conflict-ridden countries in \r\nAfrica. Our efforts to establish the Technology Bank \r\nare expected to go a long way towards addressing the \r\ntechnological requirements of and gaps facing the \r\nAfrican least developed countries.\r\nBangladesh fully appreciates Africa’s emerging \r\npotential to transform the world’s political and \r\nsocioeconomic landscape. The growing role and \r\ncontribution of African countries to the global trade \r\nand economy is also gratifying. We endorse the African \r\nUnion’s Agenda 2063 and would be happy to contribute \r\nto the Agenda in any way we can. Since many of our \r\ndevelopment challenges are similar to those of African \r\ncountries, we can complement each other by sharing \r\nour development experiences and best practices. \r\nBangladesh can help to realize the full potential of the \r\ndemographic dividend arising on the African continent \r\nwith its huge young population. Here at the United \r\nNations, we have consistently supported resolutions \r\non Africa.\r\nIn the negotiations leading to the global compact \r\nfor safe, regular and orderly migration, Bangladesh \r\nis one of the co-Chairs of the Friends of Migration \r\nGroup, coordinating closely with the Group of African \r\nStates, as our positions are often convergent. The same \r\nis true for many issues related to climate change. As \r\none of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, \r\nBangladesh realizes the challenges facing many African \r\ncountries and can contribute to building resilience and \r\nto disaster-risk reduction efforts.\r\nThe United Nations Office for South-South \r\nCooperation is a good platform for Africa’s development. \r\nWe will continue to work with the Office to cooperate \r\nfurther to that end.\r\nAs one of the leading troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries with extensive experience in peacekeeping, \r\nA/73/PV.23 19/10/2018\r\n28/28 18-32548\r\nparticularly in Africa, Bangladesh will continue to \r\ncontribute to improving Africa’s peace and security \r\nsituation. Our peacekeepers have shed blood for their \r\nAfrican brothers in the cause of peace. In almost all \r\nof the African countries where our peacekeepers have \r\nbeen deployed, they were able to leave a deep and \r\npositive mark on the society through their dedicated \r\nservice and efforts. After all, peacekeeping is not only \r\nabout the enforcement of peace but also about winning \r\nthe hearts and minds of the host population.\r\nOn the bilateral front, despite our geographical \r\nremoteness, we are continuously expanding our \r\ndiplomatic outreach to the African continent. In \r\n2016 alone, we opened as many as three full-f ledged \r\ndiplomatic missions in Africa, including one in Addis \r\nAbaba, in order to increase our engagement with the \r\nAfrican Union. Our teachers, doctors, engineers and \r\nother professionals contribute to the socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment of many African countries. There is \r\na huge opportunity for investment cooperation in \r\nhealth, agriculture, particularly contract farming, and \r\neducation-related areas within a win-win framework.\r\nWe are sharing our success in e-governance \r\nwith African countries. In Somalia, for example, \r\nwe are working on innovation in the delivery of \r\npublic services and in Ethiopia, on the role that \r\ninformation and communications technology can play \r\nin the implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. We are also in talks with some other African \r\ncountries. Those are replicable examples of South-\r\nSouth cooperation. A number of our non-governmental \r\norganizations (NGOs), including the Bangladesh \r\nRural Advancment Committee, one of the largest \r\nanti-poverty NGOs in the world, are working \r\nin many African countries in public health and \r\nsocioeconomic improvement programmes, using our \r\nhome-grown approach.\r\nBangladesh has made significant progress in \r\ncombating malaria. We have seen a reduction of more \r\nthan 50 per cent in the number of malaria cases and \r\n54 per cent in related deaths since 2010. However, \r\nmany people are still at risk of the disease. We have \r\ntherefore revised our strategy so as to ensure alignment \r\nwith the World Health Organization’s Global Technical \r\nStrategy for Malaria 2016-2030. That will also greatly \r\ncontribute towards overall national development and the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly \r\nSDG target 3.3 on ending the malaria epidemic. We are \r\nhappy to share our experiences and best practices with \r\nAfrica in terms of capacity-building and the prevention \r\nand management of malaria. We hope that a strong, \r\nwell-organized multi-stakeholder partnership can help \r\nto deliver broad health benefits to African countries, \r\nincluding the reduction of malaria in sub-Saharan and \r\nother parts of Africa.\r\nWe look forward to the continued strengthening \r\nof our partnership with Africa. We also join the \r\ninternational community in its efforts to ensure and \r\npromote peace, security and sustainable development in \r\nAfrica. We must bear in mind that the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development will remain elusive without \r\nAfrica’s development.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on these items.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 68 and its sub-items (a) \r\nand (b), and agenda item 13.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
