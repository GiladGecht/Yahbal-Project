"United Nations A/73/PV.26\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n26th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 26 October 2018, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Bahr Aluloom \r\n(Iraq), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 30\r\nSpace as a driver of sustainable development\r\nDraft resolution (A/73/L.6)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Mexico to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.6.\r\nMs. Ramírez de Arellano y Haro (Mexico) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): It is an honour for me to address the General \r\nAssembly on behalf of my country, Mexico, which this \r\nyear has the honour of chairing the Committee on the \r\nPeaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS).\r\nThis year, as part of the Committee’s sixty-first \r\nsession, we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nfirst United Nations Conference on the Exploration \r\nand Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, known as \r\nUNISPACE+50. Its high-level segment, open to all \r\nMember States, was attended by 93 States, a number \r\nof United Nations entities and specialized agencies \r\nand a wide range of international intergovernmental \r\nand non-governmental organizations in the space field. \r\nAs evidenced by its successful anniversary in June, \r\nUNISPACE+50 promoted discussions on developing \r\nnew directions for the global governance of outer-space \r\nactivities and strengthening the capacities of all States, \r\nthe Committee itself and the United Nations Office \r\nfor Outer Space Affairs to respond to new realities, \r\nchallenges and opportunities in the area of space.\r\nSpace-based tools are fundamental to meeting \r\nthe targets and indicators of the 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. The space community must \r\nwork collectively towards them for the benefit of all, \r\nparticularly developing countries. I should not fail to \r\nmention that in addition to those Goals, we also have \r\nbefore us the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \r\nReduction and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, \r\nto mention various landmarks related to space activities \r\nand their impact on all of us who inhabit the Earth and \r\nthe solar system.\r\nThe States that took part in the high-level \r\nsegment adopted the draft resolution, entitled “Fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the first United Nations Conference \r\non the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer \r\nSpace: space as a driver of sustainable development” \r\n(A/73/L.6), and recommended it for consideration by \r\nthe Assembly, under item 30 of its agenda. The work \r\nahead is to establish a Space2030 agenda, which will be \r\ncrucial to the achievement of the goals outlined in the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nThrough the pillars of space economics, space \r\nsociety, space accessibility and space diplomacy, we \r\nembark today on a COPUOS process as a single platform \r\nto discuss issues related to all space activities and to \r\nintegrate a global agenda for greater space awareness \r\nwith a view to meeting the challenges facing humankind \r\nand society’s growth. I thank those countries that have \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

We refrain from \r\nthe use or threat of use of force in our international \r\nrelations, strive to prevent an arms race in outer space \r\nand stress the need to ensure international liability \r\nfor damage caused by space activities and to continue \r\nworking on the design of an appropriate legal regime \r\nin that regard. In that belief, Paraguay has applied for \r\nmembership in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of \r\nOuter Space (COPUOS).\r\nFor space to be a driver and a decisive element in \r\nthe achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nas discussed at the 2018 session of COPUOS and in its \r\nScientific and Technical and Legal Subcommittees, it is \r\nessential to strengthen coordination and support at all \r\ninternational levels, including through improved access \r\nto space data, applications and infrastructure. We \r\nurge all Member State delegations to work together to \r\nseize and strengthen the opportunities of international \r\ncooperation offered by the exploration of outer space, \r\nas well as the development and application of space \r\nscience and technology.\r\nAll countries, regardless of their level of economic \r\nor scientific development, should participate in, \r\ncontribute to and benefit from the exploration and use \r\nof outer space for peaceful purposes. In this regard, we \r\nstress the importance of taking special account of the \r\nneeds of developing countries, particularly in building \r\ntheir capabilities to explore and use outer space for \r\npeaceful purposes without discrimination, on an equal \r\nfooting and in accordance with international law. We \r\nemphasize the importance of fostering international \r\ncooperation to that end.\r\nIn that spirit, the Government of Paraguay, which \r\nrecently ratified the Treaty on Principles Governing \r\nthe Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of \r\nOuter Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial \r\nBodies, thereby contributing to its universalization, \r\nhas also created a space agency, made up of public and \r\nprivate institutions, with the objective of promoting \r\nand implementing policies for developing national \r\nspace activities and taking advantage of outer space \r\nthrough its peaceful use. The space agency, which has \r\nbeen operating since 2017, is currently developing its \r\nspace policy and national space-activities programme \r\nand has promoted initiatives to cooperate with similar \r\ninstitutions in other States, most recently Mexico and \r\nArgentina.\r\nFinally, in our firm belief in the importance of \r\nthe work of the United Nations Office for Outer Space \r\nAffairs in the creation of national capacities and its \r\nrelevance as a platform for cooperation among States, \r\nthe delegation of Paraguay supports providing it with \r\nappropriate and sufficient resources for assisting States \r\nwith capacity-building activities in space science \r\nand technology and their applications and in the \r\ndevelopment of space legislation and policy.\r\nMs. AlZaabi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, I want to welcome the \r\nAssembly’s adoption today of draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.6, entitled “Fiftieth anniversary of the first \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Exploration and \r\nPeaceful Uses of Outer Space: Space as a driver of \r\nsustainable development”. I would also like to express \r\nour appreciation for the organization of the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations Conference on \r\nthe Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space \r\n(UNISPACE+50), which was an important opportunity \r\nto review more than 50 years of exploring and using \r\nouter space, in addition to defining the future role of \r\nthe Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space \r\n(COPUOS) in terms of the global governance of \r\nouter space.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates played an active role \r\nin making the UNISPACE+50 Conference successful, \r\nbased on our belief in the importance of achieving \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals. We recognize \r\nthat outer space has an important role to play. That \r\nis why in 2016 and 2017 we hosted two of the three \r\npreparatory forums for UNISPACE+50, held under the \r\ntopic “Outer space as a driver for economic and social \r\nsustainable development”. That led to the adoption of \r\n26/10/2018 A/73/PV.26\r\n18-34313 3/8\r\nthe Dubai Declaration, which includes many important \r\nrecommendations to be adopted within the United \r\nNations Space2030 agenda. In addition to participating \r\nin the discussion sessions of the Conference, the United \r\nArab Emirates helped to organize the UNISPACE+50 \r\nexhibition, as well as an event on the United Arab \r\nEmirates and UNISPACE+50.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is working to establish \r\na robust and sustainable outer-space sector that \r\ncan contribute to regional and international efforts \r\npromoting space exploration. That will help develop \r\nadvanced technologies that could have a positive impact \r\non people’s lives and contribute to the achievement of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nOuter space is a major area of investment for our \r\nState with a view to achieving a promising future for \r\ngenerations to come. We have developed plans and \r\npolicies for outer space that extend as far as 100 years \r\nfrom now. The most prominent of them is our 2117 Mars \r\nprogramme, which includes building the first human \r\ncity on Mars by 2117.\r\nGiven the important role that young people play \r\nin shaping and preparing for the future, with its \r\nopportunities and challenges in the outer-space sector, \r\nthe United Arab Emirates has developed a strategy \r\ntraining young nationals in this area with a view to \r\nbecoming active and essential partners in leading efforts \r\nat the local, regional and international levels to explore \r\nspace and use it in peaceful ways. In that context, my \r\ncountry has created a council for an outer-space agency \r\nfor young people of the United Arab Emirates that aims \r\nto encourage the efforts of distinguished young people \r\nfrom the agency and provides them with a platform \r\nwhere they can exchange ideas and aspirations on \r\nouter space, enabling them to come up with innovative \r\nconcepts and get help in implementing them. As part \r\nof our astronaut programme, two young Emiratis were \r\nrecently chosen to be the first Arabs to participate in \r\nthe activities of the international space station with a \r\nview to carrying out space exploration projects.\r\nIn order to implement our plans for training a new \r\nEmirati generation capable of carrying out ambitious \r\nspace projects over the next decade, a large group of \r\nelite young Emirati engineers, both men and women, \r\nhave designed and executed the KhalifaSat project, \r\nthe first satellite made in the United Arab Emirates \r\nfor monitoring purposes. Alia Al-Mansouri, a female \r\nEmirati student, conducted a scientific space experiment \r\nthat won first place in a contest in Abu Dhabi on the \r\ntheme “Genes in space”, and the National Aeronautics \r\nand Space Administration will be launching a Falcon 9 \r\nrocket carrying Al-Mansouri’s experiment, which will \r\nundoubtedly motivate her fellow students to develop \r\nmore such experiments.\r\nThe year 2020 will be a unique one for young \r\nEmiratis engaged in the space sector, as my country \r\nwill be hosting the International Conference on Space \r\nNavigation in Dubai. We will be the first Islamic-Arab \r\nState to host that conference, which was first held in \r\n1950. That year we will also launch the first Islamic-Arab \r\nprobe to Mars, making us one of nine States seeking to \r\nexplore that planet. The Hope probe will help to acquire \r\nscientific knowledge, create space applications and find \r\nhighly competent human resources in the Emirates. \r\nBy 2020, more than 150 Emirati engineers, men and \r\nwomen, will be contributing to the project.\r\nIn conclusion, as a representative of the young \r\npeople of the United Arab Emirates, I want to assure \r\nthe Assembly that we will continue to work diligently \r\nto create a better and more promising future for \r\nsucceeding generations, and in every sector, not just \r\nouter space. In that regard, we call on the international \r\ncommunity to step up its efforts to empower and invest \r\nin young people. Young people have great potential and \r\nunlimited capabilities that can build prosperous, stable \r\nsocieties if used constructively.\r\nMs. Mozolina (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): The Russian Federation supports the \r\nAssembly’s adoption today of draft resolution A/73/L.6, \r\nentitled “Fiftieth anniversary of the first United \r\nNations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful \r\nUses of Outer Space: space as a driver of sustainable \r\ndevelopment”.\r\nThe preparatory process for the conference \r\ncelebrating 50 years since the first United Nations \r\nConference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses \r\nof Outer Space (UNISPACE+50) was enriching and \r\nimportant both for understanding the areas of activity \r\nof the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful \r\nUses of Outer Space on which States have achieved \r\na mutual understanding and those on which there are \r\ndifferences of position. In particular, some States \r\nopposed strengthening the draft resolution’s provisions \r\non developing international regulations for outer-space \r\nactivities based on their belief in the importance of \r\ndeveloping exclusively national regulatory systems. \r\nA/73/PV.26 26/10/2018\r\n4/8 18-34313\r\nWhile we believe that national regulation should \r\ncertainly be developed, it must be done so that it does \r\nnot conflict with international norms and rules. Besides \r\nthat, significant differences of opinion were expressed \r\nabout the introduction into the political lexicon a few \r\nyears ago of the term “global governance of outer-\r\nspace activities”. We think it would be a good idea for \r\nthe term to be clarified within the framework of the \r\nCommittee. We hope that States’ efforts to implement \r\nthe draft resolution will contribute to the development \r\nof international cooperation on the exploration of \r\nouter space and ultimately to the achievement of \r\nthe sustainable development agenda. However, it is \r\nimportant to strive to consistently address the issue of \r\nthe safety of outer-space activities and security in space \r\nin general.\r\nAmong other things, working to achieve the goals \r\nset by UNISPACE+50 means convening a large number \r\nof so-called high-level forums organized by the United \r\nNations Office for Outer Space Affairs in cooperation \r\nwith host countries. We can only welcome the \r\ndevelopment of that type of dialogue. Together with the \r\nUnited Nations, in Moscow in September we ourselves \r\nsuccessfully held the first United Nations Conference \r\non Space Law and Space Policy, in which more than \r\n200 representatives of various countries, academia and \r\nbusinesses took part.\r\nIn general, my country attaches great importance \r\nto issues related to promoting the implementation of the \r\nsustainable development agenda through outer-space \r\nactivities. Our Government policy stipulates that the \r\nresults of outer-space activities must be used for the \r\nsocioeconomic development of the Russian Federation \r\nand its regions both for the period between now and \r\n2030 and beyond. This year Russian spaceports \r\nlaunched 10 rockets putting 22 spacecraft into orbit, \r\n10 of them foreign. As part of its basic space research, \r\nthe Russian Federation is conducting ExoMars, an \r\ninternational Mars exploration project, as well as moon \r\nexploration projects with automated spacecraft. We are \r\ncontinuing our activities in the area of manned space \r\nf light, in which we are a world leader. Work is currently \r\nunder way on a new generation of Federatsia manned \r\ntransport spaceships designed to send people and goods \r\nto stations orbiting Earth and to the moon.\r\nWe are focusing seriously on issues related to the \r\nnormative and legal regulation of outer-space activities, \r\nand in particular we are working on improving the \r\nsystem of registering objects launched into outer space, \r\nas well as studying possible options for implementing \r\nlong-term guidelines for the sustainability of space \r\nactivities based on our experience.\r\nLike other participants in outer-space activities, \r\nRussia greatly values the development of international \r\ncooperation, including in areas such as scientific and \r\ntechnical cooperation, the training of personnel and \r\ncosmonauts, joint development of space technology \r\nand its components and carrying out collaborative work \r\nin space. That also includes the monitoring of objects \r\nand events in near-Earth space, as well as the general \r\nstate of the near-Earth space environment. We believe, \r\nindeed we are certain, that the Committee can become \r\na platform for sharing experiences on a broad range \r\nof outer-space activities in the interests of sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Hodgkins (United States of America): In 1958, \r\nsoon after the launching of Earth-orbiting satellites \r\nhad imparted new intensity to the cold war, the United \r\nNations created the Committee on the Peaceful Uses \r\nof Outer Space (COPUOS) in the hope that the use \r\nof outer space would avoid extensions of national \r\nrivalries and instead be harnessed for the benefit of \r\nhumankind. Recognizing space as a new frontier of \r\nhuman endeavour that held both promise and danger \r\nin equal measure, nations aimed to erect a structure \r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations that would \r\nfoster cooperation and shared benefits.\r\nOver the past six decades, the Committee has \r\nfollowed these principles in developing and supporting \r\nthe four core outer-space treaties and in promulgating \r\nnew legally binding consensus principles and guidelines \r\nfor activities in outer space, which by the end of this \r\nmeeting will include a set of voluntary guidelines for \r\nthe long-term sustainability of outer-space activities. In \r\ndoing so, the Committee continues to make important \r\ncontributions to the global governance framework for \r\nouter space. COPUOS has also acted as a catalyst, \r\npromoting international cooperation in space activities \r\nand fostering information exchanges among developed \r\nand developing countries on the latest advances in \r\nspace exploration and applications.\r\nThe American space programme was born at the \r\nheight of the Cold War, when fears of a super-Power \r\nspace race over time reached their zenith. Fortunately, \r\nthese fears abated in no small part because of \r\ninformation collected and conveyed by satellites. Today \r\nwe are now able to see our space activities primarily \r\n26/10/2018 A/73/PV.26\r\n18-34313 5/8\r\nas an instrument of human advancement. Over the \r\npast six decades the Committee’s growing roster of \r\nmembers has continued to serve as the United Nations \r\nleading forum for advancing the peaceful exploration \r\nand uses of outer space. The most recent way station in \r\nour shared voyage is the 2018 session of COPUOS and \r\nits Scientific and Technical and Legal Subcommittees \r\n(UNISPACE+50), which celebrated the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the first United Nations Conference on \r\nthe Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, held \r\nin 1968.\r\nUNISPACE I, which was held just 11 months \r\nbefore the first humans landed on the moon, raised \r\nawareness of the vast potential for space benefits for \r\nall humankind. UNISPACE II, in 1982, continued those \r\nefforts particularly in promoting space-technology \r\napplications for developing countries. UNISPACE \r\nIII, in 1999, took into account the growing number \r\nof developing countries involved in space activities. \r\nBuilding on its success, UNISPACE+50 recognized \r\nthe growing importance of private-sector involvement \r\nin space exploration and applications. We were \r\npleased with the breadth and the scope of the topics \r\nconsidered, as well as the presentations by leading \r\nscientists, Government officials and private-sector \r\nrepresentatives.\r\nUNISPACE+50 has continued this impressive \r\nlegacy of the ways that Governments, the United Nations \r\nand civil society can partner to advance innovative \r\nspace applications for the benefit of everyone. To that \r\nend, the United States was pleased with the success of \r\nthe UNISPACE+50 commemoration that took place in \r\nconjunction with the sixty-first session of COPUOS in \r\nJune. We were particularly pleased that UNISPACE+50 \r\ninitiated a process for the Committee to develop a \r\nSpace2030 agenda over the next two years, setting the \r\ncourse for the Committee’s work through 2030.\r\nMy delegation would like to take note of the \r\nprogress made during the first meeting of the Working \r\nGroup on the Space2030 Agenda, held in Vienna from \r\n1 to 5 October. In this regard, the United States would \r\nlike to thank Ambassadors Maria Sabbatini of Italy \r\nand Dumitru-Dorin Prunariu of Romania for their \r\noutstanding leadership during the first meeting, which \r\nresulted in the development of a work plan and methods \r\nof work setting the Working Group on a path for success \r\nmoving into next year.\r\nThe United States looks forward to continuing its \r\nparticipation in these efforts to develop a visionary \r\ndocument that lays the foundation for the future work \r\nof the Committee and its Subcommittees, taking into \r\naccount new directions that Member States are taking to \r\nmove beyond low-Earth orbits to go to the moon, Mars \r\nand other celestial bodies, as well as incorporating new \r\nand innovative commercial ventures.\r\nMr. Ghaniei (Islamic Republic of Iran): Today \r\nspace science and technology are an indispensable \r\npart of our daily lives. Our dependence on them could \r\nbe compared to our dependence on air and the seas \r\nand oceans. That is why outer space is considered \r\npart of the common heritage and the province of all \r\nhumankind. It must be explored and used for the benefit \r\nof the present and future generations of all peoples, and \r\nit must be free for equitable exploration, use and access \r\nby all countries. That is the inalienable right of any \r\nState, regardless of its level of economic or scientific \r\ndevelopment.\r\nAccordingly, as a founding member of the United \r\nNations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space \r\n(COPUOS), Iran underlines the importance of ensuring \r\nthe full application of universally agreed principles on \r\nouter space. This is the only approach whereby we can \r\nensure the sustainable and equitable use of outer space by \r\nall States. In this context, we underline the importance \r\nof such principles as equality, the non-appropriation of \r\nouter space by claims of sovereignty, use, appropriation \r\nor other means, non-discriminatory cooperation \r\nin outer-space activities and non-intervention and \r\nnon-interference in the activities of States in exploring \r\nand using outer space for peaceful purposes. Those \r\nprinciples must be fully respected by all.\r\nAccordingly, access to outer space through space \r\nscience, technologies and their applications should be \r\navailable to all States without discrimination of any \r\nkind. They are indispensable tools for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. To that end, and taking into account the \r\nurgency of developing countries’ need to be able to use \r\nspace science and technologies in their socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment, cooperation with developing countries in \r\nouter-space activities should be promoted. Similarly, the \r\nnon-discriminatory transfer of related science, know-\r\nhow and technology must be promoted and ensured.\r\nIran also attaches great importance to the long-term \r\nsustainability of outer-space activities, which should \r\nbe an integral part of such activities and respected by \r\nA/73/PV.26 26/10/2018\r\n6/8 18-34313\r\nall. However, long-term sustainability should not be \r\nused as a pretext for imposing limitations on the space \r\nactivities of developing countries.\r\nEquality is one of the most important principles of \r\ninternational space law and must be strictly applied. \r\nFor instance, the exploitation of the geostationary \r\norbit should be rationalized and made available to all \r\nStates on an equal basis and without discrimination. \r\nUnfortunately, the existing regulations for allocating \r\nslots on this orbit, which basically set forth a first-come, \r\nfirst-served regime, have limited many countries’ \r\ncapacity to gain access to it. Indeed, many orbital slots \r\nare occupied only by the most developed countries. At \r\nthe present time, therefore, there is little chance for \r\ndeveloping countries to enter outer space and place \r\ntheir own geosatellites in appropriate orbital slots, \r\nwhich means they are deprived of more useful satellite \r\nservices and excluded from enjoying the benefits of \r\ngeostationary orbits. That is an inequality that must \r\nend.\r\nOne of the cardinal principles of international \r\nspace law is that outer space may be explored and \r\nutilized exclusively for peaceful purposes. Any attempt \r\nto militarize or weaponize outer space would seriously \r\nchallenge that principle.\r\nThe announcement by the United States that \r\nit will create a new military force for outer space is \r\nan alarming development. As United States officials \r\nhave stated, they seek dominance in space, view space \r\nas a war-fighting domain, and plan to work on the \r\ndevelopment of a space-based weapon system. Such \r\npolicies and measures increase the possibility of an \r\narms race or even actual conflict in outer space.\r\nWe should make every effort to ensure that \r\nouter space will be explored and used exclusively for \r\npeaceful purposes. In this context, Iran fully supports \r\nthe negotiation of a legally binding instrument on the \r\nprevention of an arms race in outer space.\r\nI would like to conclude by stressing that \r\npromoting the greatest possible use of space science \r\nand technology, ensuring the sustainability of outer-\r\nspace activities and ascertaining that space will remain \r\na zone of peace are common responsibilities. We should \r\nfulfil them responsibly.\r\nMs. Chan (Canada): Space brings an abundance \r\nand diversity of unique and fundamental benefits to \r\nEarth. As the space community moves forward with its \r\nexploration endeavours, space will continue to inspire, \r\ninnovate and provide real-world applications for the \r\nbenefit of humankind.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada, through its national space programme, is \r\nfully committed and actively working to ensure that \r\nspace science and technology provide fundamental \r\nsocial and economic benefits to all Canadians and to \r\nthe global community.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn the past three years, through the preparatory \r\nprocess for the United Nations Conference on the \r\nExploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space+50 \r\n(UNISPACE+50), the Committee on the Peaceful Uses \r\nof Outer Space (COPUOS) and the United Nations \r\nOffice for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) have \r\nsuccessfully promoted the use of space as a driver for \r\nsustainable development and increased the recognition \r\nof its unparalleled contribution to and indispensability \r\nin achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The \r\nhigh-level UNISPACE+50 segment, which took place \r\nin Vienna in June, was an excellent opportunity for \r\nthe international space community to showcase and \r\npromulgate the socioeconomic benefits of space. From \r\nenvironmental monitoring to disaster management, \r\nagriculture, rural connectivity and job creation, space \r\ntremendously benefits people and the planet and is a \r\ndynamic driver for sustainable development.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada is honoured to have played a leading role \r\nthroughout the preparatory process for UNISPACE+50. \r\nAs the Chair of COPUOS for the 2016-2017 biennium \r\nand leader of thematic priorities 4 and 5, on outer-space \r\nweather and space and global health, respectively, \r\nCanada has sought to make a significant contribution \r\nto UNISPACE+50 and to the development of the \r\nSpace2030 agenda for the Committee, its subcommittees \r\nand UNOOSA. Over the past three years, we have \r\nworked closely with colleagues from COPUOS and \r\nUNOOSA to achieve significant results. In addition \r\nto highlighting the many benefits of space, Canada \r\nconsiders UNISPACE+50 an excellent opportunity for \r\naddressing the rapid evolution of the space agenda and \r\nthe unique role played by the Committee and UNOOSA \r\nin international space cooperation and the global \r\ngovernance of space activities. We fully support the \r\nadoption of draft resolution A/73/L.6.\r\n26/10/2018 A/73/PV.26\r\n18-34313 7/8\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe UNISPACE+50 process is not yet over, and \r\nthrough its follow-on working group to develop a \r\nSpace2030 agenda, Canada will continue to deliver on \r\npromoting the peaceful use and development of space, \r\nadvancing knowledge of space through science and \r\nensuring that space science and technology provide \r\nsocial and economic benefits to all, with a focus on \r\npromoting diversity and women in space.\r\nCanada is committed to making concrete and \r\nmeasurable progress on the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. In many instances, reporting on such progress \r\nwill require data and information derived from space \r\nassets. With the second largest landmass in the world, \r\nCanada relies heavily on Earth observation as an \r\nessential and sometimes its only source of information. \r\nCanada’s long-standing expertise and advanced \r\nachievement in space-based Earth observation is a \r\nkey asset supporting decision-making in sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nFor example, space-based Earth observation \r\ndata has proved instrumental in providing reliable \r\ninformation on conditions in the Arctic. For northern \r\ncommunities, the ability to travel safely over coastal \r\nsea ice is an essential part of their basic routine, which \r\nis becoming increasingly dangerous because of climate \r\nchange. Given the extent, remoteness, and isolation of \r\nthese regions, Earth observation is often the only cost-\r\neffective and technically feasible means of obtaining \r\nreliable information on ice conditions.\r\nIn addition, over the next few months, we will \r\nlaunch the third generation of Canada’s Synthetic \r\nAperture Radar Satellite (RADARSAT) programme, \r\nthe RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). RCM \r\nwill have a significant role to play in supporting and \r\ntracking progress of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. It will revisit Canada’s vast territory and \r\nmaritime approaches on a daily basis and provide daily \r\naccess to 90 per cent of the world’s surface. It will help \r\nlead our efforts to monitor our changing northern lands \r\nand coastal waterways, providing valuable information \r\non how these remote regions are responding to both \r\nclimate change and increasing resource development.\r\nAlthough national commitments and advances \r\nare key steps towards progress on the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, it is critical that we continue to \r\nshare expertise and work together regionally and \r\nglobally to ensure success. No country can do this \r\nalone.\r\nThe Canadian delegation would like to once again \r\napplaud the United Nations for its continued work in \r\nchallenging all Governments to work in a collaborative \r\nmanner towards ending poverty, building more \r\nprosperous and peaceful societies and protecting our \r\nplanet.\r\nIn conclusion, Canada is proud to support the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the work of \r\nCOPUOS and the Office for Outer Space Affairs on \r\nthe Space2030 Agenda. We will continue to leverage \r\nspace and its assets in support of the successful \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, thereby increasing the socioeconomic benefits \r\nto humankind. As an innovative, inspirational tool for \r\npeace, diplomacy and collaboration among nations, \r\nspace is already seen as and will increasingly prove to \r\nbe a driver for sustainable development.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this agenda item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.6, entitled “Fiftieth anniversary of \r\nthe first United Nations Conference on the Exploration \r\nand Peaceful Uses of Outer Space: space as a driver of \r\nsustainable development”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMs. De Miranda (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I should \r\nlike to announce that since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution, and in addition to those delegations listed in \r\ndocument A/73/L.6, the following countries have also \r\nbecome sponsors of the draft resolution: Austria, Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, \r\nFrance, Greece, Guinea, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malawi, \r\nMalaysia, Paraguay, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, \r\nThailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nthe United Arab Emirates, Ukraine and Uruguay.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.6?\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.6 was adopted (resolution \r\n73/6).\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor for \r\nexplanations of position after adoption of the resolution, \r\nA/73/PV.26 26/10/2018\r\n8/8 18-34313\r\nI would like to remind speakers that explanations of \r\nposition are limited to 10 minutes and should be made \r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Hodgkins (United States of America): My \r\ndelegation fully supports resolution 73/6, concerning \r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the first United Nations \r\nConference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of \r\nOuter Space. However, we would like to explain our \r\nviews on three parts of the resolution, which by no \r\nmeans signifies that we have any objection to it.\r\nThe United States recognizes the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development as a global framework \r\nfor sustainable development that can help countries to \r\nwork towards global peace and prosperity. We applaud \r\nthat call for shared responsibility, including national \r\nresponsibility, within the 2030 Agenda, and emphasize \r\nthat all countries have a role to play in achieving this \r\nvision. The 2030 Agenda recognizes that each country \r\nmust work to implement the Agenda in accordance with \r\nits own national policies and priorities.\r\nThe United States also underscores that paragraph \r\n18 of the 2030 Agenda calls for countries to implement \r\nthe Agenda in a manner than is consistent with the \r\nrights and obligations of States under international law. \r\nWe also highlight our mutual recognition in paragraph \r\n58 that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda must \r\nrespect and be without prejudice to the independent \r\nmandates of other processes and institutions, including \r\nnegotiations, and that it does not prejudice or serve as a \r\nprecedent for decisions and actions that are under way \r\nin other forums.\r\nIn terms of the Sendai Framework for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction 2015-2030, which is also mentioned in \r\nresolution 73/6, the United States reiterates its view on \r\nthe Framework, which was set out in its explanation of \r\nposition delivered in Sendai in March 2015. We have \r\nbeen a strong supporter of disaster-risk-reduction \r\ninitiatives that are designed to reduce the loss of life \r\nand the social and economic impact of disasters. This \r\nassistance helps the recipients to build a culture of \r\npreparedness, promote greater resilience and achieve \r\nself-reliance.\r\nFinally, with respect to the specific reference to the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change in resolution 73/6, \r\nwe want to note that the United States announced that \r\nit intends to withdraw from the Agreement as soon as \r\nit is eligible to do so, consistent with the terms of the \r\nAgreement, unless suitable terms for re-engagement \r\nare identified. The language on the Paris Agreement in \r\nthe resolution is therefore without prejudice to United \r\nStates positions. We recognize that climate change is \r\na complex global challenge and affirm our support for \r\npromoting economic growth and improving energy \r\nsecurity while protecting the environment.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of position.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item \r\n30?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 10.55 a.m.\r\n"
