That treaty is a \r\nremarkable achievement. It is the product of a common \r\nresolve, forged by the horrors of the previous century, \r\nto create a permanent international court to prosecute \r\nand punish those responsible for the most egregious \r\ninternational crimes.\r\nWe also mark another milestone this year, the \r\nactivation of the ICC’s jurisdiction over the crime \r\nof aggression. The Court is now empowered to \r\nexercise jurisdiction over the four core international \r\ncrimes — war crimes, crimes against humanity, \r\ngenocide and aggression. It is worth emphasizing that \r\nthe ICC does not operate in isolation. It is part of an \r\ninternational criminal justice system, the Rome Statute \r\nsystem. The ICC’s role is to step in only where national \r\njurisdictions are unable or unwilling to act.\r\nAs a strong supporter of accountability and a long-\r\nstanding supporter of the ICC, Australia will continue \r\nto work with all States parties to ensure that the Court \r\nis as strong an institution as it needs to be to fulfil its \r\nmandate. We encourage Member States not yet party to \r\nthe Rome Statute to consider ratifying it, particularly \r\nnon-parties in our own region of the Indo-Pacific.\r\nAt their core, the ICC and the United Nations \r\nare striving to achieve the same goals. One of the \r\nprimary purposes of the Charter of the United \r\nNations — the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security — aligns with those of the Rome Statute. \r\nHistory has demonstrated clearly that sustainable peace \r\nand impunity for serious international crimes rarely go \r\nhand in hand. All too often, impunity catalyses conflict.\r\nThe interrelationship between the mandates of \r\nthe United Nations and the ICC makes the Court a \r\nkey partner for the United Nations, particularly as the \r\nUnited Nations pivots to focus more on prevention. As \r\nits key partner, it is critical to ensure that the United \r\nNations provides the ICC with the support it needs to \r\ndeliver on its mandate.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of the United Nations so \r\nfar and encourage the Secretary-General to continue to \r\nenhance cooperation under the Relationship Agreement. \r\nWe have heard the Prosecutor’s repeated requests for \r\neffective Security Council follow-up and support \r\nwith respect to situations referred to the Court by the \r\nCouncil. It is essential that the Council not approach \r\nICC referrals in a set-and-forget frame of mind. Its \r\nongoing political support for the work of the ICC is \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Indeed, \r\nvictims and the communities affected have been \r\nconsistently calling for justice as an essential component \r\nof viable political outcomes and reconciliation. While \r\nwe are clear-eyed about the challenges ahead, the \r\ninternational community simply must not tolerate \r\nimpunity. Those who are most responsible for serious \r\ninternational crimes must be held to account. We call \r\non the Assembly to ensure that the Court receives full \r\nand consistent support for that essential mandate.\r\nMr. Skinner-Kleé Arenales (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Allow me to thank Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nfor his briefing on his report (see A/73/334), updating \r\nus on the important events in the proceedings of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court during the past year. We \r\nappreciate and take note of the information on the cases \r\nfiled, the final judgments pronounced in two cases \r\nby the Appeals Chamber, the important decisions on \r\nreparations to victims, the preliminary examinations, \r\nand the new investigations conducted by the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor.\r\nGuatemala reaffirms its unequivocal support for the \r\nICC and its commitment to the fight against impunity. \r\nMy delegation values the support and cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the International \r\nCriminal Court, not only because they strengthen the \r\ndialogue and relationship between the two entities, but \r\nalso because they serve to give visibility to the hugely \r\nimportant work of the International Criminal Court, \r\nwhich provides us with an opportunity to strengthen its \r\nauthority and deepen our knowledge about its mandate \r\nand the unquestionable importance of cooperation \r\namong States.\r\nGuatemala would like to reiterate its respect for \r\nthe principle of complementarity and for strengthening \r\nnational systems to ensure accountability. As we have said \r\nbefore, the International Criminal Court does not replace \r\nnational courts. Moreover, an essential component of \r\nthe Rome Statute is the principle of complementarity, \r\nwhereby national criminal jurisdictions have primacy \r\nin investigating and prosecuting those responsible for \r\nthe crimes contemplated when the Court was founded, \r\nparticularly the most serious crimes.\r\nFor that reason, we believe it is necessary to improve \r\nthe cooperation between the Court and the Security \r\nCouncil so as to join their efforts and help to prevent \r\ncrimes that undermine international peace and security \r\nand fight impunity for such acts. It is also appropriate \r\nto hold regular exchanges between the Council and the \r\nCourt independently of the informational meetings that \r\nbetween the two.\r\nCooperation is one of the fundamental pillars of \r\nthe proper functioning of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. A firm commitment on the part of States parties \r\nis therefore crucial to efforts to build the Court’s \r\ncapacity to ensure accountability, bring justice, provide \r\nreparations to victims and contribute to the prevention \r\nof future crimes, as the spirit of the Rome Statute \r\nrequires.\r\nThe States parties to the Rome Statute and the \r\nmembership of the United Nations must work to \r\nstrengthen their cooperation and continually reaffirm \r\nthe relevance and importance of international \r\ncriminal justice as we work to ensure the rule of law \r\nand international peace and security. My delegation \r\nurges that we redouble our efforts to achieve a \r\nuniversal regime. Each step towards universality will \r\nsignificantly reduce the risk of impunity and help to \r\nstrengthen States’ peace and stability. For that reason, \r\nwe must continue to promote the universal dimension \r\nof the Rome Statute and maintain the momentum for \r\nthe ratification and accession processes.\r\nFinally, on the twentieth anniversary of the Court, \r\nI would like to reiterate my country’s commitment to \r\nsupporting the Court’s work, since it is more than an \r\ninstitution based on a foundational document. Its work \r\nis cross-cutting and lies at the heart of an international \r\njustice system with worldwide impact. In recognition \r\nof that, my delegation has chosen to be a sponsor of the \r\nannual draft resolution (A/73/L.8) on the work of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): The International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) is an independent organization \r\nwith a strong institutional connection to the United \r\nNations. The two are bound by a common purpose, \r\nin that both the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nRome Statute are founded on the principles of justice \r\nand international law. They have had a fruitful and \r\nproductive relationship on the basis of the Relationship \r\nAgreement governing their interaction. But while \r\nthat has been true in all the past years that we have \r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 3/31\r\ndiscussed the reports of the Court, today’s debate takes \r\non an additional dimension.\r\nInternational organizations and treaties, and \r\nindeed multilateral approaches as such, have been \r\nincreasingly under assault. Both the United Nations \r\nand the ICC have been subject to political attacks, \r\nand many of the achievements of the recent past are \r\nin jeopardy. Other areas affected include trade, climate \r\nchange, disarmament and, of course, accountability \r\nand human rights. It can therefore come as no surprise \r\nthat the International Criminal Court is yet again \r\nunder attack by those who feel threatened by the idea \r\nof international criminal justice — an area in which \r\nprogress has been fast and steady over the past two \r\ndecades. It has never been more important than it is \r\ntoday to express unequivocal political support for \r\nthe Court — the world’s first and only permanent, \r\ninternational, independent judicial institution with \r\njurisdiction over the most serious crimes.\r\nWhile our support for the Court must be unwavering, \r\nwe should not be uncritical. The Court faces significant \r\nexternal challenges, but it also suffers from problems \r\nwithin, problems that it cannot afford. It is therefore \r\ntime for the States parties to demonstrate leadership by \r\nasserting ownership, while fully respecting the Court’s \r\njudicial independence, which is an indispensable \r\nelement of any court of law. We look forward to an \r\nhonest and constructive dialogue with the Court to \r\naddress the challenges it is facing.\r\nA landmark development — not just for the Court \r\nbut for international law more generally — occurred \r\non 17 July, the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of \r\nthe Rome Statute. That day also marked the activation \r\nof the ICC’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, \r\nthe most serious form of the illegal use of force by \r\none State against another. For the first time since the \r\nNuremberg trials more than 70 years ago, we have \r\nindividual criminal accountability for illegal war-\r\nmaking. That moment, based on a consensus decision \r\nby the 123 States parties, could not be more opportune. \r\nAt a time when international norms are being dealt with \r\nin an increasingly cavalier manner, with a growing \r\nexpectation of impunity for the most heinous crimes, \r\nand when well-established international rules on the use \r\nof force are being bent or violated, nothing can be more \r\nimportant than making it clear that the commission of \r\ncrimes of aggression entails criminal accountability for \r\nthose responsible.\r\nIt is also another important illustration of how \r\nclosely the mandates of the Court and the United \r\nNations are connected. The prohibition on the use of \r\nforce is at the very core of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, and it is the International Criminal Court that \r\nnow offers the necessary complement of individual \r\ncriminal responsibility. That is essential, although \r\nnot so much because the Court is likely to exercise its \r\nnewfound jurisdiction very soon. It is not going to do \r\nso, and owing to the exemption of non-States parties \r\nfrom its jurisdictional regime, its reach is limited. \r\nIt is, however, essential for States to have a legally \r\nbinding international definition of the act and crime of \r\naggression, both for their consideration as to whether \r\nto add that crime to their national penal codes and for \r\npossible decision-making processes, including in the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe have also recently witnessed the first referral \r\nof a situation in a State that is party to the Court by a \r\nnumber of other States parties. All the triggers foreseen \r\nunder the Rome Statute for the exercise of jurisdiction \r\nhave been applied. We welcome that development and \r\nencourage reflection on a similar course of action with \r\nrespect to the crimes committed against the Rohingya \r\npopulation. Since the Court has concluded that it has \r\njurisdiction with respect to the forced deportation of \r\nthe Rohingya population who have f led to Cox’s Bazar \r\nin Bangladesh, we now have a direct path to justice. \r\nWe hope that there will be serious consideration of that \r\npolicy option, not only in the interest of justice, but \r\nalso in order to enable a forcibly displaced population \r\nto return home.\r\nWhenever there is a massive crisis of impunity, \r\nwhether in Myanmar, Syria or Yemen, we automatically \r\nhear calls for the involvement of the ICC from civil \r\nsociety, victims and policymakers. In many of those \r\ninstances, however, the Court does not have jurisdiction. \r\nWorking towards universality is a long and arduous \r\ntask. We must and can make progress — but we should \r\nbe under no illusion that a significant number of States \r\nwill join the ICC system in the coming years.\r\nHopes that the Security Council might step in \r\nto fill impunity gaps have proven futile time and \r\nagain, and it would be naive to expect that to change \r\nin the foreseeable future. It is therefore all the more \r\nimportant that we understand the Court as it was \r\ndesigned to be understood, not just as an institution \r\nworking in isolation in The Hague, but rather as \r\nthe centrepiece of an international criminal justice \r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n4/31 18-34919\r\nsystem. In that regard, strengthening the capacities of \r\nnational judiciaries can play an important role, as can \r\nthe exercise of universal jurisdiction. As evidenced \r\nin the creation of the International, Impartial and \r\nIndependent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation \r\nand Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most \r\nSerious Crimes under International Law Committed in \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011, there is \r\nroom for innovation, which is a far better policy option \r\nthan inaction. Engagement to fight impunity where the \r\nICC does not have competence complements the very \r\nmission for which the Court was created.\r\nFinally, I have the honour to deliver the following \r\nmessage on behalf of Austria, Belgium, Costa Rica, \r\nthe Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, the Netherlands, \r\nPortugal, Slovenia, Switzerland and my own country, \r\nLiechtenstein, which are all Member States that are \r\nstrong supporters of the ICC and its mission to end \r\nimpunity for the worst crimes known to humankind.\r\nWe would like to thank the facilitator from \r\nMexico for his work on the draft resolution before us \r\n(A/73/L.8), and we appreciate his intentions to deliver a \r\nconsensus outcome.\r\nOur delegations have joined the consensus on that \r\ndraft resolution because we strongly believe in the \r\nwork of the Court. We have also decided to become a \r\nsponsor of it because it includes many important points \r\nand because we want to express our commitment to the \r\nCourt. However, we would also like to point out what \r\nwe consider to be a significant deficiency in the present \r\ntext. We want to underline that the draft resolutions that \r\nthe Assembly is asked to adopt should always include, \r\nas a bare minimum, technical and factual updates. We \r\nfind it necessary to make this statement in order to \r\nhighlight the fact that a number of major international \r\nlaw developments in the past year have been omitted \r\nfrom the draft resolution before us. They include the \r\nlandmark twentieth anniversary of the Rome Statute, \r\nthe historic activation of the ICC’s jurisdiction over the \r\ncrime of aggression and the adoption of amendments \r\nadding three new war crimes to the Rome Statute.\r\nThe historic significance of those developments \r\ncannot be overstated. The Court is a central \r\nachievement of multilateral diplomacy and a true \r\nmilestone in the development of international law. In \r\nJuly, the international community marked the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the Rome Statute, an occasion that many \r\nStates used in order to reaffirm their commitment to the \r\nCourt and the broader rules-based international order. \r\nAlso in July, the ICC’s jurisdiction over the crime of \r\naggression went into effect. Never has humankind \r\nhad a permanent independent international court with \r\nthe authority to hold individuals accountable for their \r\ndecisions to commit aggression, the worst form of the \r\nillegal use of force. Now we do. The Court will thus help \r\nto enforce a fundamental provision of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, the prohibition on the use of force.\r\nFinally, last year, during its sixteenth session, \r\nthe Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute \r\nadopted three new amendments to article 8 of the \r\nStatute, expanding the Court’s jurisdiction. Those \r\nthree amendments criminalize the use of microbial, \r\nbiological or toxin weapons, weapons that injure through \r\nfragments that are undetectable by X-rays, and blinding \r\nlaser weapons, both in international armed conflicts \r\nand armed conflicts not of an international character.\r\nThe omissions in this year’s text happen to be \r\nvery significant. But even if the developments were \r\nof more limited relevance, we would still want to see \r\na General Assembly draft resolution reflect them. We \r\nmust not allow the Assembly — whether on the topic \r\nof international justice or indeed any other area — to \r\nadopt texts that are outdated. We are confident that we \r\nwill do better next year.\r\nMr. Favre (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland thanks the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, Judge Eboe-Osuji, for the presentation \r\nof his report (see A/73/334).\r\nSwitzerland aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Liechtenstein on \r\nbehalf of a number of countries, including Switzerland. \r\nI would like to add the following remarks in my national \r\ncapacity.\r\nWe States adopted the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) 20 years ago. Today, \r\nmore than ever, we need the Court to ensure a rules-\r\nbased international order, and the ICC needs us. Its \r\ncritics argue that the world would be better off without \r\nit, and no one would deny that in a perfect world the \r\nICC would have no reason to exist. Unfortunately, we \r\ndo not live in an ideal world. War and violence are still \r\nvery much with us. States often fail to fight impunity \r\nvigorously or do not have the financial and institutional \r\nresources to do so at the national level.\r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 5/31\r\nThe need for effective criminal justice — in \r\nother words, for an ICC that holds actors accountable, \r\ncontributes to the maintenance of sustainable peace and \r\nserves victims — remains unchanged. What has changed \r\nin recent years is the context. Nationalism is on the rise, \r\nand the fight against impunity at the international level \r\nis often misrepresented as an obstacle to peace rather \r\nthan as one of its building blocks. The fact that one \r\nState has recently withdrawn from the Rome Statute \r\nand that another withdrawal is about to take effect is a \r\nreflection of that regrettable development. The same is \r\ntrue for the political attacks against the Court.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, firm signals are needed. \r\nWe must reaffirm that we stand behind international \r\ncriminal justice and the ICC as a vital, independent \r\nand impartial part of it. During the high-level week of \r\nthe General Assembly, 35 foreign ministers, including \r\nSwitzerland’s, issued a public statement reaffirming \r\ntheir commitment to the Court. Equally, we consider \r\nthe referral by six States of a situation to the Court, the \r\nfirst collective referral in its history, to be a sign of trust \r\nin and support for the Court. Looking ahead, we must \r\nmaintain and strengthen our political and diplomatic \r\nsupport for the ICC. We invite Member States that have \r\nnot yet done so to investigate atrocity crimes, prosecute \r\ntheir perpetrators through their national authorities and \r\nratify the Rome Statute.\r\nThe collaboration between the ICC and the organs \r\nof the United Nations is intense, and for good reasons. \r\nTheir mandates and goals are mutually reinforcing. \r\nThe Court’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression \r\nis in the fundamental interest of the United Nations \r\nand its Member States. The Security Council can refer \r\naggressive war-making to the ICC, not to mention \r\nthe dissuasive and thereby protective effect that the \r\npossibility of referring perpetrators of aggression to \r\nthe Court provides.\r\nThe commemoration of the twentieth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of the Rome Statute reminds us of the \r\nhistoric progress that the establishment of the ICC \r\nrepresents. Today, notwithstanding the numerous \r\nchallenges that we face, we must reaffirm our collective \r\ncommitment to ending impunity for the perpetrators of \r\nthe most horrific crimes and bringing justice to victims. \r\nOur support in that regard must not falter.\r\nMr. Duque Estrada Meyer (Brazil): The Statute \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC) celebrated \r\nits twentieth anniversary on 17 July. In addition to \r\nproviding us with an opportunity to reflect on the many \r\nachievements of the past two decades in that regard, that \r\ndate represented a milestone for international justice. It \r\nmarked the activation of the ICC’s jurisdiction over the \r\ncrime of aggression and thus finally, and consensually, \r\ncompleting the Statute as originally envisaged. The \r\nfact that the ICC now has jurisdiction over the crime of \r\naggression gives additional meaning to the prohibition \r\nof the use of force, fostering a more stable, just and \r\ndemocratic world order.\r\nAs a proud founder of the ICC, Brazil is pleased that \r\nit has firmly established itself as the first permanent \r\ntribunal for fighting impunity for the most serious \r\ninternational crimes. In ensuring that those accused \r\nand brought before it are judged with fairness and full \r\nrespect for their rights, the Court is an instrument for \r\njustice and peace.\r\nI am pleased to be able to point out that not only \r\nare all South American countries parties to the Rome \r\nStatute, but also that Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates represent the second largest regional group among \r\nthe States parties, behind only the Group of African \r\nStates. Any misperception of the existence of bias or \r\nselectivity in the ICC’s activity can be definitively \r\ndispelled only by increasing the universality of the \r\nStatute and thereby expanding the space within which \r\nthe Court can operate. That is particularly relevant \r\nwhen we bear in mind that a number of important actors \r\nare still not parties to the Statute. Brazil reiterates that \r\ninternational criminal justice is a central element of the \r\nrule of law and should apply to all.\r\nIn the general debate of this session of the General \r\nAssembly, Brazil drew attention (see A/73/PV.6) to the \r\nfact that in order to improve our rules-based order, we \r\nnow have an additional task before us, that of defending \r\nits very integrity. Like all socially constructed systems, \r\ninternational law cannot sustain itself. It must be \r\nnurtured, developed and protected. The mandate of the \r\nCourt requires that it speak law to power. At a time \r\nwhen multilateralism is under fire and political attacks \r\non the ICC are increasing, Brazil underscores our \r\npolicy, namely, that we will always respect the Court’s \r\nintegrity and independence, indispensable features of \r\nany court of law.\r\nI want to take this opportunity to thank the \r\nPresident of the ICC for presenting the Court’s report \r\n(see A/73/334), which gives a clear indication of \r\nits significant workload. Since its establishment 20 \r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n6/31 18-34919\r\nyears ago, the Court has opened 26 cases involving 41 \r\nsuspects or accused and conducted investigations into \r\n11 situations. Against that backdrop, Brazil reiterates its \r\nlong-standing concern about the financing of Security \r\nCouncil referrals. That is a structural issue that goes \r\nto the very core of the relationship between the Court \r\nand the United Nations, and the General Assembly in \r\nparticular.\r\nOnce again, we reiterate our call for the \r\nimplementation of article 13 of the Relationship \r\nAgreement and article 115 (b) of the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich provide clear guidance to the effect that such \r\ncosts should be met, at least partially, by funds provided \r\nby the United Nations and should not fall solely on the \r\nparties to the Statute. It is equally important to stress \r\nthat as laid out in Article 17 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, the General Assembly has the exclusive \r\nresponsibility to consider and approve the budget of \r\nthe Organization. The proper funding of Security \r\nCouncil referrals would enhance the credibility of both \r\nthe Court and the United Nations. To date, the budget \r\nallocated within the Court in relation to those referrals \r\namounts to more than €60 million. The current situation \r\nis neither fair nor sustainable.\r\nThe report contains a number of suggestions \r\naimed at improving the relationship between the \r\nSecurity Council and the Court. Brazil concurs with \r\nthe assessment that a more structured dialogue between \r\nthem on issues of mutual interest, both thematic and \r\nsituation-specific, would be beneficial. Through the \r\ncase law that it has developed over the past two decades, \r\nthe ICC has accumulated significant knowledge on \r\nissues such as children and armed conflict, women \r\nand peace and security, and the protection of cultural \r\nproperty. The discussion in the context of the Council’s \r\nArria Formula meeting on 6 July convened by the \r\nStates parties that sit on the Security Council, provided \r\nfood for thought in that regard. From a very practical \r\nperspective, there is significant room for improvement \r\nin the cooperation between the Security Council \r\nSanctions Committees and the ICC, especially with \r\nregard to travel bans and assets freezes.\r\nIncreased cooperation remains one of the best \r\nways to enhance the Court’s effectiveness. While the \r\nexecution of its outstanding arrest warrants regrettably \r\ncontinues to be the most visible challenge in this area, \r\nit will also be critical to diversify witness-relocation \r\nagreements and strengthen financial investigations. \r\nAsset recovery could even contribute to securing funds \r\nfor reparations to victims and covering the costs of \r\nlegal aid.\r\nSeeking to reconcile retributive and restorative \r\njustice, the Rome Statute contains a sophisticated set \r\nof provisions on victims’ rights that seeks not only to \r\nprotect victims but also to enable them to participate in \r\nthe proceedings and apply for reparations. Victims of \r\ngenocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the \r\ncrime of aggression have rights, and their voices must \r\nbe heard. Over the past 20 years, more than 22,000 \r\nvictims have applied to participate in proceedings, and \r\nthousands more have applied to make submissions at the \r\ninvestigation stage or during reparations proceedings.\r\nBrazil notes with appreciation that providing justice \r\nfor victims continues to be an essential component \r\nof the Court’s daily work. We welcome the fact that \r\nreparations procedures are ongoing in various cases and \r\nthat the Trust Fund for Victims has assisted more than \r\n450,000 individuals with physical and psychological \r\nrehabilitation, as well as material support. We commend \r\nthe efforts being made to enhance witness protection, \r\nincluding through relocation agreements, and we stress \r\nthe role of the positive dimensions of cooperation \r\nthrough the strengthening of national capacities.\r\nThe quest for peace and justice is always challenging, \r\nand that challenge is inherent in the search for a more \r\njust and collaborative world order. Let us not fall into \r\nthe trap of operating with dichotomies that oppose \r\npeace to justice and sovereignty to accountability. We \r\nshould rather focus on the shared values that bring the \r\nGeneral Assembly together and that have made the \r\nfirst permanent and treaty-based international criminal \r\ncourt a reality. Brazil remains firm in its commitment \r\nto the Rome Statute system and to the cause of justice \r\nthat motivated its creation.\r\nMs. Durney (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Chile \r\nappreciates the full report of the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) (see A/73/334), \r\ncovering the period from 1 August 2017 to 31 July 2018, \r\nwhich reflects the workload of the Court, 20 years \r\nafter the adoption of the Rome Statute. We take note \r\nof the account of its judicial activities in that period, \r\nas well as those of the Office of the Prosecutor and the \r\nRegistry, in the areas of preliminary examinations, \r\ninvestigations and judicial proceedings, including final \r\njudgments in two cases, and decisions on reparations to \r\nvictims and their implementation in fulfilment of the \r\nCourt’s mandate. Our appreciation also goes to the new \r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 7/31\r\nPresident of the Assembly of States Parties, who led our \r\nwork during this period.\r\nChile has actively supported the Court since \r\nthe beginning of the process that led to the adoption \r\nof the Rome Statute, as we stated at the anniversary \r\nceremonies that took place in The Hague and New \r\nYork. One of the concrete ways we showed our support \r\nwas by ratifying the amendments to article 8 of the \r\nRome Statute, as well as the amendments to the Statute \r\nrelating to the crime of aggression. We are aware of \r\nthe progress that has been made and of the challenges \r\nthat the Court faces on a daily basis and that make it \r\nurgent to ensure that States continue to work together \r\nin a coordinated manner.\r\nThe celebrations commemorating the anniversary \r\ngave us an opportunity to highlight the importance \r\nof the relationship between the States parties and the \r\nCourt, which makes it possible to address through a \r\ncomprehensive dialogue issues that demand that the \r\ncriminal proceedings’ effectiveness and efficiency be \r\nstrengthened and the challenges of cooperation and \r\ncomplementarity addressed. We reiterate the value of \r\nboth concepts, and the importance of mechanisms to \r\nhold those responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court accountable for their actions. We therefore \r\ncall on all States to cooperate fully with the Court and \r\nwork together to deal with one of its greatest challenges.\r\nConsideration of the issue of the complementarity \r\nand cooperation of national, regional and international \r\ncourts, in which the International Criminal Court plays \r\na key role, should continue, both within the Assembly \r\nof States Parties and within individual States in \r\nconjunction with their domestic bodies with judicial \r\nand investigative functions. My country would like \r\nto reiterate its commitment to that effort, as we have \r\ndone regularly in the working groups in The Hague and \r\nNew York, and we hope to make progress in drafting \r\nlegislation on cooperation with the Court that takes into \r\naccount the various areas where that cooperation must \r\nbe implemented.\r\nWe recognize the crucial work of the Court’s \r\nTrust Fund for Victims, which must have the means \r\nto fulfil its task of contributing to the physical and \r\npsychological rehabilitation of victims and providing \r\nmaterial support to survivors of the crimes governed \r\nby the Statute. In that regard, we would like to recall \r\nthe visit of the President of the Assembly of States \r\nParties to Uganda, along with representatives of 10 \r\nStates, including Chile. There they monitored the \r\nactivities of the Trust Fund and received information \r\nin the field and the testimonies of community leaders \r\nand survivors. We thank the Government of Ireland and \r\nthe Trust Fund for chairing that initiative. The ICC’s \r\ndigital exhibit “Trauma, healing and hope” reminds \r\nus that the international community’s efforts to assist \r\nvictims must not cease. We therefore call for voluntary \r\ncontributions to the Trust Fund for the benefit of victims \r\nand their families.\r\nMy delegation believes that the communication \r\nbetween the International Criminal Court and the \r\nUnited Nations must be intensified, and we support \r\nthe Court’s efforts in that regard to ensure the Security \r\nCouncil’s effective follow-up of situations that it \r\nrefers to the Court. We also very much hope that the \r\nissues before States and the Court will be receive due \r\ncooperation, as should issues raised by the Council’s \r\nfollow-up to referrals.\r\nWe also want to place on record our appreciation \r\nto the Secretary-General for the services and facilities \r\nthat he provided in accordance with the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the Court and the United Nations \r\nduring the sixteenth session of the Assembly of States \r\nParties, held at United Nations Headquarters from 4 to \r\n14 December 2017. It was important not only because of \r\nthe election of six judges, whose admission to the Court \r\nwe have celebrated, but also because of the historic \r\nagreement reached on activating the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt over the crime of aggression.\r\nWe would also like to express our appreciation \r\nfor the work of the secretariat of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties, which provided substantive support \r\nduring the sixteenth session. We view its functional \r\nindependence and structural integrity in meeting the \r\nneeds of States parties to the Statute as fundamental \r\nand therefore particularly wanted to highlight its work \r\non this occasion.\r\nWe reiterate our commitment to achieving the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute and our confidence \r\nin the role played by the International Criminal Court \r\nwithin the architecture of international justice in \r\neffectively combating impunity for the crimes that \r\ninternational community considers most serious. The \r\nregrettable withdrawal of some States from the Statute, \r\nwhich we hope can be reversed, as well as the failure of \r\nsome to ratify or accede to the Statute, should not stop \r\nus from seeking to maximize the Court’s effectiveness \r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n8/31 18-34919\r\nand presence within the framework of the international \r\nlegal system.\r\nMr. Guillermet-Fernández (Costa Rica) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): My delegation thanks Judge Eboe-Osuji \r\nfor presenting the reports of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe activities of the International Criminal Court (ICC)\r\nduring the period from 2017 to 2018. I would also like \r\nto congratulate him on his appointment in March as \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court.\r\nThe International Criminal Court is undoubtedly \r\nthe most important achievement of the international \r\njustice system. It is a product of the desire of the \r\ninternational community to put an end to impunity for \r\nthe most serious crimes against humanity and to bring \r\njustice to its victims. Its essence and main strength lie \r\nin the fact that the desire for justice is global. For that \r\nreason, we appreciate the trend towards universality of \r\nthe Rome Statute and its amendments.\r\nIn that regard, we congratulate Panama, Guyana \r\nand Ireland on ratifying the Kampala amendments on \r\nthe crime of aggression, bringing the number of States \r\nthat have ratified them to 37. In addition, Costa Rica \r\nurges all States parties to continue working to achieve \r\nuniversality and to continue their efforts to ratify the \r\nlatest amendments to article 8 of the Statute, approved \r\nby the Assembly of States Parties in December 2017.\r\nCosta Rica welcomes the addition on 17 July to \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction of the capacity to cover the \r\ncrime of aggression and the celebration of the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the Rome Statute on the same date. The \r\nInternational Criminal Court was an aspiration of the \r\ninternational community for many years. Just over 20 \r\nyears after the adoption of the Rome Statute, we can \r\nnow say that the Court has fulfilled expectations, \r\nbringing justice to victims of the crime of aggression \r\nand laying the foundations for a solid and innovative \r\njurisprudence on international criminal law.\r\nWith regard to victims, my delegation recognizes \r\nthe importance of the fact that a total of 12,509 \r\nvictims participated in cases before the Court during \r\nthe reporting period, and we were pleased that during \r\nthe reporting period the Court received a total of \r\n384 new applications from victims for participation \r\nor reparations. That is a reflection of the Court’s \r\nimportance and the central role it plays for the victims \r\nof the most egregious crimes under international law.\r\nNor should we forget that the Court inquestionably \r\noperates on the principle of complementarity and was \r\nnot created to replace the functions of national courts. \r\nIn that regard, we should reaffirm that the primary \r\nobligation to end impunity for the most heinous crimes \r\nrests with States in the responsible exercise of their \r\nsovereignty. State sovereignty imposes obligations for \r\nthe investigation and prosecution of crimes committed \r\nunder the jurisdiction of the State concerned.\r\nOnly when a State party “is unwilling or unable to \r\ncarry out an investigation or prosecution”, as established \r\nin article 17, paragraph (a), of the Statute, should those \r\ncrimes be brought to the attention of the International \r\nCriminal Court. For that reason, complementarity \r\nis an essential part of the machinery of international \r\ncriminal justice. However, it is essential to make it \r\nclear that when the Court’s jurisdiction is activated, \r\nStates parties must comply with the inalienable \r\nresponsibilities outlined in the Rome Statute. Failure \r\nto comply with those responsibilities is particularly \r\nserious when non-compliance translates into a refusal \r\nto provide the required support for the investigations of \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor or into the prevention or \r\nhindering of access to evidence, which could ruin an \r\ninvestigation and the associated case and open up the \r\npossibility for impunity.\r\nSimilarly, the fight against impunity is hindered \r\nevery time a State party fails in its obligation to execute \r\ncurrent arrest warrants. A lack of cooperation with \r\nthe Court in fulfilling its orders also prevents it from \r\nproviding victims with the justice they seek and deserve. \r\nRefusing to cooperate with the Court under the pretext \r\nthat it is not impartial or because a high percentage of \r\nits cases refer to alleged violations occurring in the \r\nsame region is not acceptable.\r\nIt is time to change the narrative. Those who make \r\nsuch arguments ignore the fact that the situations in \r\nMali, Côte d’Ivoire, Uganda, the Democratic Republic \r\nof Congo and the two situations in the Central African \r\nRepublic were referred to the Court by the Governments \r\nof those countries, while the situations in Libya and the \r\nSudan were referred to the Court by the Security Council. \r\nOnly three out of 11 situations — in Kenya, Georgia \r\nand Burundi — have been initiated motu proprio by the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor. It would therefore be absurd \r\nto expect the Office of the Prosecutor to reject referrals \r\nfrom States parties in order to maintain a geographical \r\nbalance in its cases.\r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 9/31\r\nDuring the period covered by the report, the \r\nCourt had a large volume of work. It issued new \r\narrest warrants against two individuals, one of whom \r\nwas transferred to the Court, and continued with \r\nthree trials. It pronounced final judgments in two \r\ncases before the Appeals Chamber and made several \r\nimportant decisions regarding reparations to victims. \r\nThe Prosecutor opened a new investigation, and another \r\n10 situations remained open. Since its inception, the \r\nCourt has initiated a total of 26 cases and conducted \r\ninvestigations of 11 situations.\r\nIn order to continue fulfilling its mandate, the \r\nCourt requires the support and cooperation of the \r\nentire international community, particularly the \r\nUnited Nations, with which it shares the ideals of \r\naccountability, the protection of human rights, and \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nWe were pleased to hear that the Court received the \r\nvaluable cooperation of the United Nations on various \r\nmatters, such as operational assistance in the field, the \r\nprovision of United Nations personnel for interviews \r\nand testimony, when needed, and the dissemination \r\nof information generated by the United Nations and \r\nprovided under the reimbursement model.\r\nHowever, my delegation reiterates the need for the \r\nUnited Nations to participate in financing the referrals \r\nmade to the ICC by the Security Council. The Charter \r\nof the United Nations holds the Security Council \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, and therefore, in undertaking those \r\nreferrals, the Court is helping the Council to fulfil its \r\nmandate. In such cases of cooperation, article 13 of \r\nthe Relationship Agreement between the Court and \r\nthe United Nations must be applied, providing for an \r\neconomic contribution from our Organization.\r\nIn the 20 years since the adoption of the Statute, we \r\nhave witnessed the evolution of an institution that has \r\nlittle by little transformed into reality the objectives set \r\nby the delegations that came to Rome in the summer \r\nof 1998. Today only the most experienced could name \r\nall the cases that have been before the Court or that the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor has investigated. The Court’s \r\njurisprudence speaks for itself. Nevertheless, 20 years \r\nis not a long time, if we take into account the fact that \r\nwe want this Court to be permanent and to transcend \r\nour children’s generation as well as our own. There is \r\nmuch that remains to be done, and States have the main \r\nresponsibility to ensure that the Court has the necessary \r\ntools to deliver on its mandate.\r\nCosta Rica would like to emphasize its full \r\nsupport for the International Criminal Court. We are \r\ncommitted to continuing to support its universalization, \r\nindependence and integrity so that together with other \r\nStates parties, and with the support of the community \r\nof nations, we can ensure that international justice is \r\nrespected and achieved, including by acknowledging \r\nthe immunity of its judges and its legitimacy as a \r\nlegal body.\r\nThe International Criminal Court has filled a legal \r\nvacuum that existed for many decades in the progressive \r\ndevelopment of international law. It is not dead or on its \r\ndeathbed. On the contrary, we predict that it will enjoy \r\na long life in its efforts to ensure the rights of victims \r\nand attain justice.\r\nMrs. Leega Piiskop (Estonia): We thank Judge \r\nEboe-Osuji, President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC), for his presentation of the latest annual \r\nreport of the Court (see A/73/334) and his ongoing \r\nservice to it. We welcome this debate today to discuss \r\nthe contributions of the Court and the international \r\ncommunity to international criminal justice.\r\nEstonia fully aligns itself with the statement made \r\nthis morning by the observer of the European Union \r\n(see A/73/PV.27).\r\nEstonia firmly believes that the ICC is an essential \r\ntool for fighting impunity and thus contributes to \r\npeaceful societies. It has played a crucial role in the \r\nmaintenance of a rules- and values-based world order. \r\nIt is unfortunate that the rules-based international \r\nsystem, the foundation of the international community, \r\nis increasingly being challenged and questioned. \r\nInternational criminal justice needs greater political \r\nsupport. In that context, we would like to mention the \r\nparticular role played by the Security Council. We call \r\non all States, and the Council, to take appropriate action \r\nto fully cooperate with the Court so that perpetrators can \r\nbe brought to justice and we can put an end to impunity.\r\nWe would like to recall that it is the primary \r\nduty of States to prevent and respond to international \r\ncrimes, and we stress that the ICC complements rather \r\nthan replaces national courts. Its complementary \r\nrole in cooperation with national justice systems and \r\nits assistance in strengthening them are particularly \r\nimportant to efforts to combat impunity. The ICC’s \r\neffectiveness and efficiency in fulfilling its mandate \r\ninevitably depend on States’ full cooperation with it, \r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n10/31 18-34919\r\nirrespective of whether they are parties to the Rome \r\nStatute or not.\r\nWe share the concern of the President of the \r\nCourt about the fact that the prompt and unconditional \r\nexecution of arrest warrants of the ICC remains a \r\nchallenge today. When States parties do not comply, \r\nthe ICC must be able to rely on the Security Council to \r\nintervene with its full support. We need to strengthen \r\nour common efforts to bring an end to conflicts and \r\nmake perpetrators accountable. We must also do more \r\nto offer important protection to victims and witnesses \r\nwho have suffered from or witnessed crimes. Here \r\nwe would like to stress the Court’s important role in \r\ndelivering justice to the victims of atrocious crimes by \r\nproviding assistance and awarding reparations.\r\nThe Court is currently dealing with more cases and \r\nsituations than ever, covering most of the regions of the \r\nworld. We note that there have been significant judicial \r\ndevelopments at all stages of the proceedings before \r\nthe Court. We also note that the ICC has continued to \r\nexpand its tasks relating to preliminary examination \r\nactivities and that two new preliminary examinations \r\nwere opened this year. The increasing number of cases \r\nand situations also demonstrates that there is wide \r\ntrust in the ICC and testifies to the good work it has \r\ndone. However, its increasing workload also creates \r\nchallenges for the Court in terms of its ability to remain \r\nefficient and effective.\r\nThis year we celebrated the twentieth anniversary \r\nof the Rome Statute and witnessed the activation of the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression this \r\npast summer. It is up to us to further strengthen the \r\nCourt so that it can fulfil its mandate effectively.\r\nEstonia is committed to continuing to work together \r\nwith all partners to further the work of the ICC and \r\nstrengthen the system of international criminal justice. \r\nWe call on all Governments that have not yet ratified \r\nthe Rome Statute to do so.\r\nMs. Ioannou (Cyprus): I would like to add some \r\nremarks to the statement delivered this morning by the \r\nobserver of the European Union (see A/73/PV.27), with \r\nwhich my delegation fully aligns itself.\r\nLet me start by thanking Judge Eboe-Osuji, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nfor his presentation. It is Cyprus’s firm belief that the \r\nICC is an indispensable pillar of the international rules-\r\nbased order that humankind has struggled so hard to \r\nbuild over the past few decades, with the United Nations \r\nat its core. The Court stands for every lofty purpose \r\nthat the United Nations was created to serve, that is, \r\nto ensure that there is no impunity for the most serious \r\ncrimes, establish accountability and thereby deter the \r\ncommission of such crimes, highlight restorative justice \r\nas an essential component in achieving sustainable \r\npeace and support the victims of such crimes.\r\nIn order to effectively serve those objectives, the \r\nCourt must have a global mandate. However, as we \r\ncommemorate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Rome Statute and the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nNuremberg trials, the ICC is not as close to universality \r\nas we would like. Universal ratification of the Rome \r\nStatute remains the only realistic way of effectively \r\naddressing jurisdictional gaps and thereby dealing with \r\ncurrent challenges and shortcomings. It is also crucial \r\nto the application of the principle of equality before the \r\nlaw and the effective deterrence of the most serious \r\ncrimes under international law. We would therefore like \r\nto take this opportunity to call on all States that are not \r\nyet parties to the Rome Statute to ratify it.\r\nCyprus reiterates its commitment and unfailing \r\nsupport to the Court, which we have given it since its \r\ninception, as well as to full cooperation between the \r\nCourt, the United Nations and its States Members. We \r\nare pleased that during the reporting period Cyprus \r\nmade its first symbolic contribution to the Trust Fund \r\nfor Victims, which must be commended for its work. \r\nWe should not forget that we collectively created \r\nthe Court to provide justice to millions of victims of \r\nunimaginable atrocities that deeply shock humankind.\r\nAs reflected in its report (see A/73/334), the \r\nCourt had another very full year in terms of judicial \r\nproceedings, including investigations, preliminary \r\nexaminations and institutional developments. It \r\ncontinued three of its trials, pronounced final \r\njudgments on two cases before the Appeals Chamber \r\nand issued several important decisions on reparations \r\nto victims. The Prosecutor is also engaged in ongoing \r\ninvestigations relating to 11 situations.\r\nIt was significant that on 6 September, the Court \r\nissued for the first time a decision on the Prosecution’s \r\nRequest for a Ruling on Jurisdiction under Article 19 \r\n(3) of the Statute, finding that the Court has jurisdiction \r\nwith respect to the alleged deportation of a population \r\nfrom a State that is not party to the Rome Statute to \r\nthe territory of a State party. In so holding, the Court \r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 11/31\r\nemphasized that the rationale for its determination \r\non the Court’s jurisdiction in relation to the crime \r\nof deportation may apply to other crimes within the \r\njurisdiction of the Court as well, in circumstances \r\nwhere an element of a crime occurs on the territory of \r\na State party.\r\nOne of my country’s foreign-policy priorities is \r\npreventing the destruction of cultural heritage and \r\nillicit trafficking in it. We therefore recognize the great \r\nsignificance of the Al Mahdi case, the first in which \r\nthe ICC found an individual guilty of the war crime of \r\nattacking historic and religious buildings in Timbuktu, \r\nMali. We welcome the progress regarding reparations in \r\nthat case. We also welcome the active engagement of the \r\nCourt’s Prosecutor in discussions on the responsibility \r\nto protect cultural heritage and the signing of a letter of \r\nintent between the Prosecutor and the Director-General \r\nof UNESCO, enhancing their cooperation in line with \r\ntheir mandates.\r\nLastly, Cyprus is particularly pleased with the long-\r\nawaited activation of the amendments to the Court’s \r\njurisdiction over the crime of aggression, which is \r\nthe worst form of the illegal use of force. The historic \r\nsignificance of the decision to activate the Kampala \r\namendments to the Rome Statute cannot be overstated. \r\nWe anticipate the application of the law contained \r\nin those amendments by the Court in exercising its \r\njurisdiction over the crime of aggression, and we \r\nlook forward to the universal acceptance of those \r\namendments, so that the international community can \r\nbe assured that no one will be immune from prosecution \r\nfor the commission of that supreme international crime.\r\nMr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): Ukraine aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered this morning by the observer of \r\nthe European Union (see A/73/PV.27), and we would \r\nlike to add a few remarks in our national capacity.\r\nWe welcome the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) and thank him for his \r\ncomprehensive presentation of the Court’s annual \r\nactivities (see A/73/334). This year has been significant \r\nfor the ICC, not only because of its marking of the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Rome \r\nStatute, but also thanks to the activation of its jurisdiction \r\nover the crime of aggression on 17 July. That represents \r\na huge step forward for the international criminal \r\njustice system and for strengthening the preventive \r\nrole of the Court, as well as further contributing to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nAs a sponsor of draft resolution A/73/L.8, I \r\nwould like once again to emphasize the importance of \r\ncooperation with the ICC on the part of States that are \r\nnot party to the Statute, as well as the United Nations \r\nand other international and regional stakeholders, in \r\norder to enable it to carry out its activities.\r\nUkraine supports the International Criminal Court, \r\nwhich has proved its effectiveness in promoting the \r\nrule of law and combating impunity. It is important \r\nto highlight the fact that Ukraine was among the \r\nfirst States to support the idea of establishing the \r\nfirst permanent treaty-based international tribunal to \r\ndeal with individual criminal responsibility for the \r\nmost serious crimes under international law. Ukraine \r\nactively participated in the Preparatory Committee \r\non the Establishment of an International Criminal \r\nCourt. In 2000, I had the honour of personally signing \r\nthe Rome Statute. Ukraine was also among the first \r\nnon-States parties to ratify the Agreement on Privileges \r\nand Immunities of the International Criminal Court.\r\nAt the same time, Ukraine is not yet a party to \r\nthe Rome Statute. However, on 17 April 2014, the \r\nGovernment of Ukraine lodged a declaration under \r\narticle 12 (3) of the Statute, accepting the jurisdiction \r\nof the ICC over crimes committed on its territory \r\nbetween 21 November 2013 and 22 February 2014. \r\nFurthermore, on 8 September 2015, the Government of \r\nUkraine lodged a second declaration under article 12 \r\n(3) of the Statute, accepting the jurisdiction of the ICC \r\nin relation to crimes committed on its territory from \r\n20 February 2014, that is, since the beginning of the \r\nmilitary aggression of the Russian Federation against \r\nUkraine. Those declarations have been made for an \r\nindefinite duration. The ICC will therefore be able to \r\nexercise its jurisdiction over such crimes, regardless \r\nof the nationality of the persons who have committed \r\nthem, even if they are citizens of a third State.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Court continued \r\nto engage actively with Ukrainian authorities and \r\nnon-governmental organizations with regard to the \r\npreliminary examination of the situation in Ukraine, \r\nboth through consultations at the Court and during \r\nits missions to Ukraine, the most recent of which took \r\nplace in June.\r\nIn particular, Ukrainian law-enforcement agencies, \r\nin cooperation with civil-society organizations and \r\nhuman rights defenders, have continued to document \r\nand provide the Court with additional information, \r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n12/31 18-34919\r\nfacts and evidence related to the nature of the existing \r\narmed conflict in Ukraine as an international armed \r\nconflict caused by the armed aggression of the Russian \r\nFederation against Ukraine, as well as information \r\nrelated to the numerous war crimes committed by the \r\naggressor State’s armed forces, occupation authorities, \r\npersonnel and proxies in the temporarily occupied \r\nterritories of Ukraine.\r\nWe appreciate the work done by the Office of the \r\nProsecutor and look forward to the ICC report on its \r\npreliminary examination activities in 2018.\r\nIt is a priority for the Ukrainian authorities and a \r\nstrong demand on the part of the people of Ukraine that \r\nthe organizers, supporters and perpetrators of the grave \r\ncrimes committed in Ukraine be held to account and \r\nprosecuted. In that regard, I would like to emphasize \r\nUkraine’s commitment to the fight against impunity \r\nand reiterate that my country will spare no effort to \r\nensure that justice is done.\r\nMr. Oña Garcés (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation thanks the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji, for presenting \r\nthe report of the International Criminal Court on \r\nits work carried out in 2017 and 2018, contained in \r\ndocument A/73/334. We also welcome draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.8, submitted today by Mexico, on the report \r\nof the Court, of which we are a sponsor and which we \r\nhope will be adopted by consensus.\r\nEcuador has consistently defended the role of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and justice and the defence of the \r\nrule of law, and its function as an essential component \r\nin conflict prevention and reparations to the victims \r\nof the most serious crimes. Today we reiterate our \r\nsupport for the Court as a mechanism with unique \r\ncharacteristics that enable it to fight impunity. We urge \r\nall States present here today to lend their support to the \r\nCourt so that it can effectively and concretely exercise \r\nits jurisdiction over the most serious crimes of concern \r\nto the international community.\r\nAn irrevocable objective for Ecuador is to make \r\nprogress on universalizing the Rome Statute and the \r\njurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. We \r\nmust move beyond short-term political considerations \r\ntowards a genuine universal criminal justice system \r\nthat combats impunity and enables those responsible \r\nto be punished. Crimes of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression, which \r\nare subject to the complementary jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt, can be best prosecuted if States universally \r\naccede to the Statute and provide the necessary \r\ncooperation to the Court. However, as we have already \r\npointed out, that universality does not just concern the \r\nuniversal accession by States to the Rome Statute; it \r\npertains to every part of the world and to all the crimes \r\nagainst humanity that are taking place in the world at \r\nthis very moment. It does not have double standards, \r\nand it extends beyond political or economic interests, \r\nwhich could otherwise lead us to evaluate similar \r\nsituations with different criteria.\r\nIn that regard, we recognize and support the ongoing \r\nwork of the Court, which, since its establishment, has \r\nopened a total of 26 cases involving 41 suspects or \r\naccused. We also give our full support to Ms. Fatou \r\nBensouda, Prosecutor of the Court, whose work has \r\ncontributed to the Court’s recent historical achievements \r\nand enabled it to issue new arrest warrants against two \r\npersons and continue three trials in the reporting period. \r\nWe support the Office of the Prosecutor’s ongoing \r\ninvestigations into 11 situations and its willingness to \r\nopen new preliminary investigations and examinations \r\nin all parts of the world where necessary. Those \r\nlandmark actions undercut the misguided criticism \r\nthat has been voiced of selectivity and bias in the \r\nCourt’s investigations. We deplore States’ withdrawal \r\nor notifications of withdrawal from the Rome Statute. \r\nWe support all efforts to achieve the universality of the \r\nStatute, provided that they do not require concessions \r\nor weaken the Court’s scope or jurisdiction.\r\nEcuador incorporated into its 2008 Constitution \r\nand domestic criminal legislation the mandatory nature \r\nof measures and penalties against the crime of genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity, war crimes, the enforced \r\ndisappearance of persons and the crime of aggression. \r\nIn our country, no amnesties or statutes of limitation \r\ncan be applied to those crimes. That fully coincides \r\nwith the Rome Statute, whose very raison d’être is the \r\nfight against impunity. We therefore welcome the fact \r\nthat the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute \r\ndecided by consensus to activate the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nover the crime of aggression, which entered into force \r\non 17 July. Ecuador is in the process of ratifying the \r\nKampala amendments, and we call on everyone to work \r\ntogether to achieve their universality.\r\nI want to take this opportunity to reiterate our \r\nposition with regard to the principle of complementarity \r\nas it concerns the Court and its jurisdiction. We \r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 13/31\r\nattach particular importance to complementarity, as \r\na mechanism that enables States to cooperate in the \r\nfight against impunity and involves national capacity-\r\nbuilding, which is critical. Through complementarity, \r\nthe International Criminal Court supports national \r\nlegislations. It is not a substitute for them.\r\nEcuador supports any initiative aimed at \r\nstrengthening the fight against impunity. That is why \r\nin June we successfully hosted a high-level regional \r\nseminar with the International Criminal Court, during \r\nwhich 11 Latin American Governments signed the \r\nQuito Declaration on the twentieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court. In that same spirit of commitment, I \r\nam pleased to announce that in the coming days the \r\nGovernment of Ecuador will sign the code of conduct \r\nregarding Security Council action against genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes.\r\nMy delegation also believes that it is essential for the \r\nCourt to have the necessary funding to enable it to meet \r\nthe objectives set out in the Rome Statute, especially at \r\na time when the judges’ caseloads, the investigations in \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor and the general workload \r\nof the Court have increased. In addition, we believe it \r\nis essential to strengthen the mechanisms for obtaining \r\nresources and improving the international community’s \r\ncooperation with regard to the Trust Fund for Victims, \r\ngiven the fact that the Fund assists the work of the \r\nCourt with regard to a fundamental element of justice, \r\nthe protection of victims and reparations for the crimes \r\ndealt with in the Rome Statute.\r\nMy delegation would also like to express its \r\nsupport for the efforts of the United Nations system to \r\nimprove the channels of cooperation with the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor and other organs of the Court. We call \r\non Member States to provide every possible support \r\nto the fulfilment and execution of the orders issued by \r\nthe relevant authorities of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. We welcome all the activities undertaken during \r\nthe year to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of \r\nthe Rome Statute. They send a powerful message of \r\nsupport for the Court, highlighting the importance of \r\nthat unique judicial institution’s mandate and the need \r\nfor a more vigorous and effective Court in the face of \r\nthe alarming proliferation of the most serious crimes \r\naround the world.\r\nLast but not least, my delegation would like to \r\nexpress special appreciation for the work of the Registry \r\nof the Court and the secretariat of the Assembly of States \r\nParties, whose efficiency and effective coordination and \r\nsupport have made it possible to achieve these results.\r\nMs. Telalian (Greece): Greece aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered earlier by the European Union, \r\nand I would now like to make some further comments \r\nin my national capacity.\r\nFirst, we want to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji, \r\nfor his comprehensive briefing. We also thank the \r\nInternational Criminal Court for its annual report to \r\nthe United Nations (see A/73/334), which gives us an \r\nopportunity to take stock of the achievements and the \r\nprogress made by the Court during the reporting period \r\nin the fight against impunity and also to reflect on the \r\nchallenges that it faces.\r\nThis year we are celebrating the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute. On \r\n17 July 1998 in Rome, the international community \r\ntook a crucial step towards the establishment of a \r\npermanent international criminal court that would \r\nbe able potentially to intervene as a complementary \r\nmechanism in any situation involving serious \r\ninternational crimes, while also serving as a powerful \r\ndeterrent to the commission of such crimes.\r\nHaving from the very beginning wholeheartedly \r\nsupported the establishment of the International \r\nCriminal Court, on the occasion of this anniversary \r\nGreece would like to reiterate its support for the Court \r\nand its legitimacy, as well as to express its commitment \r\nto the Court’s independence and to the integrity of \r\nthe Rome Statute. In that respect, we regret the recent \r\nwithdrawals from the Statute and call on all States that \r\nhave not yet joined it to do so in order to expand its reach \r\nand deepen its work so as to ensure that the most heinous \r\ninternational crimes do not go unpunished. We are also \r\nready to continue assisting the Court in fulfilling its \r\nmandate in an increasingly complicated international \r\nenvironment, radically different from that of 20 years \r\nago, when its Statute was adopted. We firmly believe \r\nthat the Court must be able to act without hindrance \r\nwithin the legal parameters defined by its founding \r\ntreaty. We also encourage the Court to continue to \r\nreview its judicial and administrative processes in order \r\nto enhance its effectiveness, maximize the impact of its \r\nwork and live up to the expectations of the international \r\ncommunity and of the victims of crimes falling within \r\nits jurisdiction.\r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n14/31 18-34919\r\nAs the report of the Court demonstrates, effective \r\ncooperation with the Court remains a key challenge \r\nto its fulfilment of its mandate. Furthermore, while \r\nSecurity Council referrals may help expand the reach \r\nof the Court to areas not falling within the scope of \r\nits jurisdiction, it is crucial to have active follow-up \r\nfor such referrals in order to ensure cooperation with \r\nthe Court and make full use of the possibilities that the \r\nRome Statute offers in the fight against impunity. We \r\ntherefore share the view expressed in the report that a \r\nstructured dialogue between the Court and the Security \r\nCouncil could improve the implementation of referral \r\nresolutions and enhance accountability.\r\nLast but not least, Greece welcomes the historic \r\nactivation during the reporting period of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction over the crime of aggression, which \r\ncompletes the regulatory framework of the Rome \r\nStatute and reinforces the prohibition and prevention \r\nof the illegal use of force in international relations, \r\nthereby help to strengthen the relevant purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMs. Byrne Nason (Ireland): Ireland associates \r\nitself with the statement made earlier by the observer \r\nof the European Union on behalf of its member States \r\n(see A/73/PV.27).\r\nI want to take this opportunity to thank the \r\nInternational Criminal Court for its annual report \r\n(see A/73/334) to the United Nations and to thank its \r\nPresident, Judge Eboe-Osuji, for his presentation today \r\n(see A/73/PV.27), which outlines a year of significant \r\ndevelopments in relation to many aspects of the \r\nCourt’s work.\r\nThis year marks the twentieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Rome Statute and provides an \r\nopportunity to reflect on the achievement that is the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Twenty years ago, the \r\ninternational community set up the first permanent \r\nInternational Criminal Court with jurisdiction to \r\nprosecute individuals for the most serious crimes of \r\nconcern to the international community when States \r\nare unwilling or unable to do so. In so doing, we made \r\nit clear that there are certain lines that should not be \r\ncrossed and that if they are crossed, there must be \r\naccountability for the perpetrators and justice for \r\nthe victims. The victims must be a central focus of \r\nour concerns.\r\nMy country, Ireland, sees the International \r\nCriminal Court as the cornerstone of international \r\ncriminal justice. The annual report, outlining as it \r\ndoes the range of situations under examination, the \r\nvarious ongoing investigations and the cases being \r\nprocessed, demonstrates how very necessary the Court \r\nis, in our view. Over its lifetime, it has been subject \r\nto much criticism, some of which may be justified, of \r\ncourse, because no institution is perfect. Constructive \r\ncriticism is both warranted and helpful. However, \r\nsome of the harshest criticism directed at the Court is \r\nnot motivated by some failure of the Court to fulfil its \r\nmandate but precisely because it is doing its duty to \r\ncombat impunity for the most serious crimes of concern \r\nto the international community. Echoing the words \r\nof Simon Coveney, Ireland’s Tánaiste-Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade \r\nwith responsibility for Brexit, in his address to the \r\nAssembly last month (see A/73/PV.13), I want to take \r\nthis opportunity today to reaffirm Ireland’s continuing \r\ncommitment to working to ensure that the Court can \r\nfulfil the mandate that it has been given.\r\nThis year we also witnessed a further significant and \r\nhistoric development whereby the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nover the crime of aggression was activated as of 17 July. \r\nIreland welcomes that important development, which \r\nsends a clear signal about the fundamental importance \r\nof the prohibition of the use of force and the overriding \r\nimperative of preserving world peace. Ireland took the \r\nstep of ratifying the amendment to the Rome Statute \r\non the crime of aggression just a few weeks ago, on \r\n27 September.\r\nIt is always important to recall that the Court \r\ndoes not operate in a vacuum. It is very much a key \r\nelement in the system of international criminal justice. \r\nAs is clear from the annual report, the Court has a \r\nnetwork of relationships with the United Nations, other \r\ninternational organizations, States and civil society. \r\nCooperation on the part of the international community \r\nas a whole is essential for its success. In this debate, \r\nwe believe that it is particularly relevant to reflect on \r\nthe relationship that the Court has with the United \r\nNations. Justice and peace are at the very core of why \r\nboth organizations exist. Ireland very much shares \r\nthe view that the Court and the United Nations, while \r\nclearly having differing mandates, can and should \r\nreinforce one another in fulfilling those mandates. It \r\nis encouraging to see a reference in paragraph 65 of \r\nthe report to ongoing cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Court, including crucial support for \r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 15/31\r\nthe Court on the part of the United Nations senior \r\nleadership, up to and including the Secretary-General.\r\nThe report also references the importance of \r\ncooperation between the Court and the Security \r\nCouncil. Ireland was pleased that on 6 July the States \r\nparties to the Court serving on the Security Council, \r\nled by the Netherlands, convened an Arria Formula \r\nmeeting to discuss relations between the Court and the \r\nCouncil. Many helpful suggestions were put forward at \r\nthat meeting about how to strengthen the interaction \r\nand cooperation between the Security Council and \r\nthe Court, and we believe they deserve further \r\nconsideration. In particular, Ireland would welcome the \r\nfurther exploration of possible mechanisms to improve \r\nthe support that the Council can provide to the Court in \r\nrelation to the Court’s work on situations referred to it \r\nby the Council pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nA key issue that the Security Council should address \r\nis cases of non-cooperation by States in relation to such \r\nreferrals. Fifteen such cases have been referred to it, \r\nwith no substantive response, according to the report. \r\nFurthermore, we believe that the Court must receive \r\nadequate financial support when situations are referred \r\nto it. Those issues are undoubtedly challenging, but it is \r\nnecessary to address them so as to enable the Court to \r\ndo what the Council mandates it to do when referring \r\nsuch situations to it — delivering justice in situations \r\nof grave concern with a potential to destabilize \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nI also take this opportunity to reiterate Ireland’s \r\nfirm view that there must be unity of purpose within the \r\ninternational community in prosecuting mass crimes \r\nthrough the international criminal justice system. \r\nThere should be consistency in the referral of situations \r\nto the Court. Ireland supports the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil veto power and believes that at a minimum, the \r\nuse of the veto must be restricted in accordance with \r\nthe French-Mexican initiative and the cross-regional \r\nAccountability, Coherence and Transparency group’s \r\ncode of conduct regarding Security Council action on \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\r\nI also want to highlight the emphasis given to victims \r\nby the Rome Statute. One of the welcome innovations \r\nin the Statute was the manner in which that document \r\nsought to address the needs of victims. One of those \r\ninnovations was the establishment of the Trust Fund \r\nfor Victims. The focus of the Trust Fund’s critically \r\nimportant work is to deliver tangible reparative justice \r\nto victims and their families and communities. It is \r\nimportant to remember that the Trust Fund depends on \r\nvoluntary contributions for its work and that without \r\nactive support from States parties, its vital work would \r\nstall. Ireland is, therefore, pleased to make a regular \r\nannual contribution to the Trust Fund, and this year we \r\nhave increased our contribution. Also, as members will \r\nsee in the annual report, in February Ireland undertook \r\na joint initiative with the Trust Fund and conducted a \r\nmonitoring mission in northern Uganda. The purpose of \r\nthe mission was to assess the impact of the Trust Fund’s \r\nwork and promote it. The President of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties and representatives of 10 States parties \r\ntook part in that mission. We firmly believe that \r\ndelivering on real and effective reparative justice is \r\ncritical to the implementation of the Rome Statute. We \r\necho the Trust Fund’s call ton States parties and others \r\nto consider making new and increased contributions.\r\nIn conclusion, Ireland, like others, is fully aware \r\nthat, in order to implement the principles of the Rome \r\nStatute, it is absolutely essential that we work together. \r\nWe are committed to the universality of the Rome \r\nStatute. The greater the reach of the International \r\nCriminal Court, the greater the chance that the core \r\nprinciples underlying the Statute will be respected. \r\nWe encourage all States that have not yet done so to \r\nconsider becoming party to the Statute.\r\nMr. Bermúdez Álvarez (Uruguay) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The delegation of Uruguay is grateful for \r\nthe full report on the activities of the International \r\nCriminal Court covering the period from 1 August \r\n2017 to 31 July 2018 (see A/73/334).\r\nImportant events have taken place during that \r\nperiod, particularly the activation of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction over the crime of aggression by the \r\nAssembly of States Parties, which met in December \r\n2017. The jurisdiction entered into force on 17 July, \r\nwhich coincided with the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nRome Statute. That activation of the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nover the crime of aggression is a cause for celebration, \r\nas it is a victory for the ideal of justice and law. Despite \r\nthe opposition of several States, which had no legal \r\ngrounds, consensus was finally reached.\r\nDespite its shortcomings and the need for \r\nimprovement, we need an independent Court for \r\nprosecuting the most atrocious crimes, detailed in article \r\n5 of the Rome Statute. The International Criminal Court \r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n16/31 18-34919\r\nhas been a milestone in the international community’s \r\nstruggle against impunity and the most serious crimes \r\nagainst human beings and their integrity and rights. It \r\nwas made possible because we prioritized international \r\nhuman rights law and international humanitarian law \r\nwith a focus on the victims of such crimes.\r\nAttacks on women and children, slavery and the \r\nuse and recruitment of children, for example, are some \r\nof the cases that may now be subject to the Court’s \r\njudgment. Uruguay has always prioritized the defence \r\nof human rights, both domestically and internationally. \r\nThat is why we helped to set up the Court and were part \r\nof the negotiation process that led to its establishment. \r\nWe were one of the first countries to ratify the Rome \r\nStatute, through our adoption in 2006 of Law No. \r\n18026, on cooperation with the International Criminal \r\nCourt. We were also the first country in Latin America \r\nto ratify the Kampala amendments, in September 2013. \r\nThe importance of the Court and its mission impels us \r\nto support any action aimed at improving its operation. \r\nWe would like to remind the States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute of the need to cooperate with the Court to ensure \r\nits ability to fulfil its mandate. We also believe that it \r\nis important to raise awareness about the importance of \r\nthe Court and therefore about the importance of States \r\nacceding to the Rome Statute by ratifying the Statute \r\nand its amendments.\r\nUruguay believes that cooperation between States \r\nand the International Criminal Court is essential if the \r\nCourt is to achieve its objectives and enable us to put \r\nan end to impunity for perpetrators of the cruel acts \r\ndetailed in the Rome Statute. We must bear in mind \r\nthe work, independence and impartiality of the judges, \r\nwhich applies to the Court as a whole, and the difficult \r\nwork that they do in carrying out their duties.\r\nFor Uruguay, combating crimes against humanity, \r\nwar crimes, genocide and crimes of aggression \r\nperpetrated against the rights of men, women, children \r\nand groups is vital. It is important, above all, in the \r\ncurrent difficult context when there is a lack of \r\ncooperation on maintaining maximum support for the \r\nCourt’s work, which is essential if we wish to ensure \r\nthat human rights, human dignity and the rule of law \r\nare respected at the international level.\r\nMr. Arriola Ramírez (Paraguay) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The delegation of the Republic of Paraguay \r\nthanks the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, Judge Eboe-Osuji, for presenting the annual \r\nreport of the Court (see A/73/334) and commends the \r\nCourt and the Office of the Prosecutor for their work in \r\nthe period from 2017 to 2018.\r\nThe delegation of Paraguay is a sponsor of draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.8, which is under consideration by \r\nthe General Assembly today.\r\nFor Paraguay, the establishment of an International \r\nCriminal Court was a very important milestone in the \r\nhistory of humankind, as the international community \r\nsought to address and overcome impunity for the most \r\natrocious crimes, ensure justice and reparations for \r\nvictims of international crimes within the framework \r\nof international law, and realize the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nParaguay reaffirms its commitment to international \r\ncriminal justice and advocates the universalization \r\nof the Rome Statute, to which it is a party, and of \r\nthe Kampala amendments, which are currently \r\nunder legislative review by our National Congress, a \r\nprocedure required by our Constitution prior to their \r\napproval and ratification.\r\nIn its Constitution, Paraguay acknowledges \r\ninternational law and is governed by the principles that \r\nf low from it. We acknowledge a supranational legal \r\norder that among other things provides guarantees for \r\nhuman rights, and we prohibit and declare genocide, \r\ntorture, the forced disappearance of persons and \r\nkidnapping and homicide for political reasons to be \r\ncrimes that are not subject to any statute of limitations.\r\nThe law regarding the national implementation of \r\nthe Rome Statute categorizes and establishes a gradation \r\nof penalties for genocide, crimes against humanity \r\nand war crimes, distinguishes between national and \r\nuniversal jurisdiction, and specifies the limitations \r\nof national jurisdiction, which are provisions that are \r\ncomplemented by general criminal legislation.\r\nThrough their jurisprudence, Paraguay’s courts have \r\nalso implemented the principle of universal jurisdiction. \r\nOne notable example is Judgment No. 195/2008 of the \r\nSupreme Court of Justice of the Republic of Paraguay, \r\nwhich established the irrevocability of horrendous and \r\nrepudiated crimes, such as torture, thereby enshrining \r\na high standard of protection of human rights and \r\nreaffirming that violations of fundamental human \r\nrights must not go unpunished.\r\nThe Republic of Paraguay offers a legal framework \r\nthat concerts with international criminal justice, and \r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 17/31\r\nsince 2003 we have extended a standing invitation \r\nto international organizations that wish to observe \r\nthe efforts undertaken in Paraguay by Government \r\nagencies and civil-society organizations in relation to \r\nthe promotion of human rights.\r\nParaguay considers that in its exercise of universal \r\njurisdiction and under the principle of complementarity, \r\nin situations of serious and systematic violations against \r\nhumanity, the Court may represent a light of hope and \r\njustice for a people oppressed by authoritarian regimes, \r\nby holding those responsible for such violations to \r\naccount before international criminal justice. Paraguay \r\ntherefore calls on all States, regardless of their status \r\nas parties to the Rome Statute and its amendments, \r\nand on all actors in the international community, to \r\ncooperate with the International Criminal Court so as \r\nto ensure its independence and impartiality, facilitate \r\nits investigations and execute its decisions, with a view \r\nto trying the defendants, with full respect for their \r\nfundamental human rights, thereby bringing to account \r\nthose who have committed heinous crimes and securing \r\nreparations to their victims.\r\nFinally, Paraguay strives to bring together other \r\nexisting institutions and mechanisms for the realization \r\nof international criminal justice with the International \r\nCriminal Court. We trust in the efforts of international, \r\nglobal, regional and subregional bodies to monitor \r\nhuman rights situations around the world and document \r\npossible cases of atrocity crimes. We emphasize the \r\nimportance of optimizing the cooperative relations \r\nbetween the International Criminal Court and the \r\nSecurity Council in the follow-up to the cases referred \r\nby the Council to the Court and in the execution of \r\nthe Court’s decisions by the Council. We believe that \r\nthe discussion of issues of mutual interest by the two \r\nbodies, and in particular with regard to the relevance \r\nof the work of the Council’s Sanctions Committees \r\nto the enforcement of the Court’s decisions, will be \r\nproductive to that end. We also appreciate the work \r\nof non-governmental organizations, civil society and \r\nacademia aimed at achieving the universalization of \r\nthe Rome Statute and its amendments and at raising \r\nawareness of the virtues of the multilateral system of \r\ninternational criminal justice.\r\nMr. Imnadze (Georgia): Georgia aligns itself \r\nwith the statement made earlier by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union (see A/73/PV.27), and in addition, I \r\nwould like to make a few remarks in my national capacity.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the President \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC), Judge \r\nEboe-Osuji, for his comprehensive presentation, and \r\nwe welcome the report of the Court (see A/73/334). \r\nThe strengthening of universality and cooperation \r\nwith the Court are key factors enabling the ICC to \r\nwork effectively to end impunity for the perpetrators \r\nof the most egregious crimes that threaten international \r\npeace, security and well-being. We believe that the role \r\nof the ICC is to complement rather than replace existing \r\nnational judicial systems. The primary responsibility \r\nfor investigating and prosecuting crimes still remains \r\nwith individual States.\r\nAs we mark the twentieth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Rome Statute, the international community must \r\ntake a collective stance on the fight against impunity. \r\nWe welcome the milestone achievement represented \r\nby the activation of the Court’s jurisdiction over the \r\ncrime of aggression on 17 July of this year, the Day of \r\nInternational Criminal Justice. In the volatile world we \r\nall live in, it is vital that we all unequivocally support \r\nthe international justice system. The Rome Statute \r\nessentially created a permanent and global institution \r\nthat embodies the Nuremberg principles aimed at \r\nfighting impunity and preventing the most heinous \r\ncrimes. It is time to reflect on the challenges, take \r\nstock of the achievements and unite in echoing the call \r\nof “Never again”.\r\nSince the ratification of the Rome Statute in 2003, \r\nGeorgia has been cooperating effectively with the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. As an enabling factor in \r\nour fully f ledged cooperation with the ICC, we have \r\nput in place legislation to implement the Statute at the \r\nnational level. Furthermore, in December 2017 an ICC \r\nfield office was opened in Georgia to support various \r\norgans of the Court and cooperate with stakeholders \r\non the ground and relevant United Nations agencies. \r\nIn that connection, I would like to underline that just \r\na few days ago Georgia hosted a high-level regional \r\nICC conference designed to promote and enhance \r\ncooperation between the Court and countries from \r\nEastern Europe and Western Asia.\r\nIn conclusion, let me stress Georgia’s support \r\nfor the recommendations in the current report of the \r\nCourt regarding the necessity of investigating crimes \r\ncommitted in Georgia during the Russian aggression of \r\n2008, and in that context, we support the Prosecutor’s \r\ncall on the Russian Federation to cooperate with \r\nthe Court on its investigations. I want to once again \r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n18/31 18-34919\r\nreiterate my country’s unwavering support for the ICC \r\nas an important tool in the international community’s \r\nfight against impunity and a significant contribution to \r\nthe maintenance of peaceful societies.\r\nMs. Stresiná (Romania): We would like to thank \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nJudge Eboe-Osuji, for his eloquent presentation of the \r\nCourt’s annual report (see A/73/334).\r\nRomania aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nthis morning by the observer of the European Union \r\n(see A/73/PV.27).\r\nTwenty years ago, more than 120 States made a \r\ncollective commitment to ending impunity for the \r\nmost serious crimes. The adoption of the Rome Statute \r\nchanged the paradigm of international criminal justice, \r\nsending a strong signal that perpetrators of such horrific \r\ncrimes can and must be held accountable.\r\nThis year’s anniversary offered us a good \r\nopportunity to reflect on the achievements and the \r\nlessons learned in the functioning of the world’s only \r\npermanent international criminal judicial institution. \r\nThe ICC has made significant progress in developing \r\nitself further. With active cases that are in all stages \r\nof proceedings, the Court has developed its own body \r\nof jurisprudence, including standards that may set \r\nbenchmarks for the future. In that context, we should \r\nunderscore its contribution to the establishment of \r\nsexual violence in conflict and the destruction of \r\ncultural heritage and property as international crimes.\r\nThe growing deterrent effect of the ICC is \r\nincreasingly evident. The investigation of mass crimes \r\nis now the expected norm, and the input of the Court to \r\nthat end cannot be ignored. The harsher tone of its critics \r\nis merely a reflection of its relevance. As an independent \r\nbody working in a tense political landscape, the \r\nresolve of the Court should not be affected by volatile \r\nrelationships with States and the implicit challenges of \r\nsecuring cooperation and resources.\r\nWhile we have confidence in the non-discriminatory \r\napplication of the relevant criteria in selecting cases and \r\nsituations, the Prosecutor’s role is extremely difficult \r\nand unavoidably prone to controversy. However, it is up \r\nto the Court to ensure fair proceedings so as to protect \r\nthe credibility and effectiveness of the ICC. From that \r\npoint of view, we would like to salute the ongoing \r\nefforts of the Court to implement the necessary reforms \r\naimed at improving its effectiveness.\r\nAt the same time, we would like to emphasize the \r\nvictim-centred approach to criminal justice as one of \r\nthe innovations brought in by the ICC. We therefore \r\nfurther encourage the Court and States to focus on \r\nthe components of victim participation and effective \r\nrepresentation by tackling existing challenges in that \r\nfield. Victims’ confidence in the Court will remain a \r\nstrong indicator of its legitimacy.\r\nThe ICC is not free of problems. It is obviously \r\nimportant to discuss the various concerns about its \r\nperformance constructively. However, any criticism \r\nshould take into consideration the limitations imposed \r\nby the Court’s treaty-bound competence, its reliance \r\non State support and its external financial constraints. \r\nFrom that point of view, we should remind ourselves \r\nthat the ICC is an essential piece of the Rome Statute \r\nsystem, but not the only one. It is a court of last \r\nresort that was not meant to, and cannot, solve every \r\ninternational crime committed in this world. The \r\nstrength of the system should actually rest on the work \r\nof the national courts, which serve as the first line of \r\naccountability for the most egregious crimes.\r\nAs a co-focal point for this topic since 2017, \r\nRomania strongly supports the implementation of \r\nthe complementarity principle, which represents the \r\ncornerstone of the ICC machinery. Our aim f or the long \r\nrun should be to reduce the number of cases submitted \r\nto the Court as more Member States are willing and \r\nable to investigate and prosecute crimes within their \r\njurisdictions. We therefore echo the Court in its plea \r\nto the relevant actors to include capacity-building \r\nelements for judicial reform in assistance programmes \r\ndevoted to the development of the rule of law.\r\nFurthermore, we must be constantly aware that the \r\nCourt depends on State cooperation in order to function \r\neffectively. In that context, we would like to reiterate \r\nRomania’s support for the Court and add our voice \r\nto the calls for enhanced cooperation between States \r\nparties and the ICC, in accordance with the obligations \r\nset forth in the Rome Statute.\r\nThe potential for improving relations between the \r\nSecurity Council and the Court in support of dealing \r\nbetter with the gravest crimes that threaten international \r\npeace and security remains unaddressed. After the \r\nArria Formula meeting of the Council in July this year, \r\nwe encourage the continuation of a more structured and \r\naction-oriented dialogue on the matter.\r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 19/31\r\nRomania welcomes last year’s historic consensus \r\ndecision to activate the Court’s jurisdiction over the \r\ncrime of aggression, which reinforces the prohibition \r\nof the illegal use of force as enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. While we can continue the \r\ndiscussion about potentially burdening the ICC with \r\nmore expectations, in our view the main added value \r\nof that decision lies, in its symbolic power, by forcing \r\nboth policymakers and citizens to focus on the question \r\nof the legality of wars, and more specifically, on the \r\nresponsibility of individuals for them.\r\nIn conclusion, Romania shares the view that the \r\nadoption of the ICC Statute constitutes one of the most \r\nimportant achievements in the fight against impunity. \r\nAchieving the universality of the Rome Statute \r\nwould be a powerful tool for preventing violations of \r\ninternational criminal law and, at the same time, a \r\nsignificant contribution to establishing lasting peace \r\nand healthier societies, in accordance with the core \r\nprinciples and values of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Escalante Hasbún (El Salvador) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): We would like to begin, as every other \r\nspeaker has done, by thanking the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), Judge Eboe-Osuji, \r\nfor his briefing on the report of the Court (see A/73/334), \r\nwhich details the conduct of both administrative and \r\njudicial activities and has been transmitted to the \r\nGeneral Assembly in accordance with article 6 of the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court and paragraph 28 \r\nof resolution 72/3.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the commemoration on \r\n17 July of the twentieth anniversary of the Court’s \r\nfounding treaty, the Rome Statute, and we stress the \r\nimportance of the Court’s mandate for the international \r\ncommunity, as well as the need to strengthen the \r\ninternational criminal justice system.\r\nWe were pleased to read that in the past year the \r\nInternational Criminal Court has continued to maintain \r\na heavy workload with the issuance of new warrants \r\nof arrest against two persons, the continuation of three \r\ntrials and the delivery of final judgments in two cases \r\nbefore the Appeals Chamber, as well as a number of \r\nimportant decisions on reparations to victims, a focus \r\nof the Court’s activities that represents one of its \r\ngreatest strengths. In addition, the Prosecutor opened a \r\nnew investigation, and there are 10 other situations that \r\nremain open.\r\nIn that regard, while we are aware that in recent \r\nyears the International Criminal Court has achieved a \r\nlot, we also recognize that much remains to be done. \r\nThe road ahead is full of challenges and opportunities \r\nfor the Court’s efforts to prosecute serious human \r\nrights violations and bring to justice those who have \r\ncommitted crimes under the Rome Statute. It also \r\nserves as a deterrent to those crimes.\r\nIn view of the above, our country calls on States \r\nto ratify the Kampala amendments, and we especially \r\nwelcome the activation in July of the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nover the crime of aggression, in line with the decision \r\nadopted by the Assembly of States Parties in New York \r\nin December 2017. That step reinforces the jurisdiction \r\nand competence of the International Criminal Court.\r\nAs part of our commitment to the international \r\ncommunity and the International Criminal Court to \r\nstrengthening the Court’s normative and operational \r\nstructure, we have initiated domestic efforts under \r\nour national legislation to ratify the Agreement on the \r\nPrivileges and Immunities of the International Criminal \r\nCourt as soon as possible, as we are convinced that \r\nsuch an instrument will facilitate its fulfilment of its \r\npurposes as well as its functions.\r\nFinally, I want to conclude by reiterating my \r\ncountry’s deep support and commitment to the work \r\nof the International Criminal Court, and we urge \r\nthose who have not yet ratified the Rome Statute and \r\nits amendments to do so, with a view to ensuring the \r\nfull universality of the Statute in the near future and \r\npromoting justice and accountability at the global level.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, I would like to congratulate \r\nJudge Chile Eboe-Osuji on his election as President of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) and thank him \r\nfor presenting his report (see A/73/334) on the activities \r\nof the Court over the past year.\r\nI would also like to express our gratitude for the \r\npresentation of the reports of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/73/333 and A/73/335) on the implementation of \r\narticle 3 of the Relationship Agreement between the \r\nUnited Nations and the International Criminal Court \r\nand on the expenses incurred and reimbursements \r\nreceived in connection with the assistance provided \r\nto the International Criminal Court. Argentina also \r\nsupports the adoption of this year’s draft resolution \r\n(A/73/L.8) on the report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, which coincides with the presentation of \r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n20/31 18-34919\r\nthe report by its President and today’s debate on the \r\nagenda item.\r\nIn its remarkable activity since the presentation \r\nof the previous report (see A/72/PV.36), the Court has \r\nonce again demonstrated that it is in fact a fundamental \r\ntool in the fight against impunity, the promotion of \r\nhuman rights and the consolidation of the rule of law at \r\nthe international level.\r\nWithin the framework of the twentieth anniversary \r\nof the Rome Statute, Argentina renews its ongoing \r\ncommitment to the Court by remaining actively \r\ninvolved in the mechanisms envisaged by the Assembly \r\nof States Parties and through its support for the goal of \r\nachieving the universality of the Statute.\r\nArgentina has demonstrated its support in various \r\nways, but we are particularly proud to have been the \r\nfirst State party to conclude the four cooperation \r\nagreements suggested by the Court. Similarly, \r\nArgentina has also ratified the Kampala amendments \r\non the crime of aggression and therefore welcomes the \r\nactivation of the Court’s jurisdiction over that crime. \r\nThat activation completes the legal edifice that is the \r\nCourt, reaffirming the prevalence of law and justice \r\nover the use of force in international relations.\r\nI would now like to discuss the relationship between \r\nthe Court and the United Nations. The relationship \r\nbetween our Organization and the Court is crucial, while \r\nit must always respect the judicial independence of the \r\nCourt. In that context, we reiterate some of the concerns \r\nthat Argentina has regarding the referral of situations \r\nby the Security Council to the Court, particularly in \r\nterms of their financial cost. That cost has so far been \r\nborne exclusively by States parties to the Statute of the \r\nCourt, despite the clear rules contained in the Rome \r\nStatute and the Relationship Agreement between the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and the United Nations, \r\nwhich state that the costs of such referrals must be \r\nborne by the United Nations.\r\nThe fight against impunity is an objective shared \r\nby the States parties to the Rome Statute and the United \r\nNations, but that objective must be accompanied by a \r\ncommitment to providing the Court with the resources \r\nnecessary to fulfil its functions. Lack of action in \r\nthat regard could jeopardize the sustainability of the \r\nCourt’s investigations and damage the Organization’s \r\ncredibility. We also believe that there is scope for a \r\ncloser and better relationship between the Court and \r\nthe Security Council, especially with regard to the \r\nwork of its subsidiary bodies, such as the Sanctions \r\nCommittees and the Working Group on Children and \r\nArmed Conflict.\r\nIn conclusion, Argentina wants to emphasize the \r\nInternational Criminal Court’s contribution to the \r\nobjectives of this Organization in its fight against \r\nimpunity for the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern. Indeed, the Court’s contribution to the \r\nconfiguration of a multilateral system that aims to \r\npromote respect for human rights and achieve a lasting \r\npeace, in accordance with international law and the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, is unquestionable.\r\nThe suffering of the victims of the most atrocious \r\ncrimes is humankind’s greatest shame. We cannot \r\nallow this century to pass without providing concrete \r\nresponses to those violations. That will enable us to \r\nwork together to build a more just world under the \r\nprimacy of international law.\r\nMr. Islam (Bangladesh): Bangladesh thanks \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) for his comprehensive report with its valuable \r\ninsights (see A/73/334). We commend his observations \r\nconcerning the standing of the ICC vis-à-vis national \r\nsovereignty, a relationship worthy of the attention of all \r\nMember States.\r\nBangladesh is pleased once again to be a sponsor \r\nof draft resolution A/73/L.8, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court”. We have taken due \r\nnote of the updates on the judicial and prosecutorial \r\nactivities of the Court, as well as on the status of \r\npreliminary examinations.\r\nDuring the reporting period, we followed the ruling \r\nby the Pre-trial Chamber of the ICC on the issue of the \r\nforced deportation of the Rohingya population from \r\nMyanmar’s Rakhine state to Bangladesh with particular \r\ninterest, in our capacity as a State party to the Rome \r\nStatute. We acknowledge the sua moto initiative by the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor to seek the Pre-trial Chamber’s \r\nruling in that regard, especially at a time when the Court \r\nitself faces challenges on multiple fronts. Bangladesh \r\nconsidered it a solemn responsibility as a State party \r\nto respond to the letter sent by the Pre-trial Chamber \r\nwithin the set deadline. Against the backdrop of our \r\nbilateral efforts with Myanmar to ensure the safe, \r\ndignified and sustainable return of the Rohingya people \r\nto Rakhine state, we consider the Pre-trial Chamber’s \r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 21/31\r\nruling concerning the possible denial of their right to \r\nreturn to be an important development.\r\nBangladesh will continue to cooperate with the \r\nCourt in the wake of the Pre-trial Chamber’s ruling, \r\nwhile we want to underscore the need for ensuring \r\naccountability for the entire spectrum of atrocity crimes \r\ncommitted against the Rohingya by the Myanmar \r\nsecurity forces and the non-State actors concerned. In \r\nthat context, we recall the responsibility of the Security \r\nCouncil in the face of the authoritative evidence of \r\nthe gravest crimes under international law committed \r\nagainst the Rohingya, which has been furnished by the \r\nUnited Nations Independent International Fact-finding \r\nMission on Myanmar. We acknowledge the Human \r\nRights Council’s decision to act on the Fact-finding \r\nMission’s report (A/HRC/39/64) and to establish an \r\nongoing independent mechanism to collate, analyse and \r\npreserve evidence for facilitating the prosecution of \r\ncrimes through the appropriate national or international \r\njudicial mechanisms. It is crucial to the restoration of \r\nconfidence among the forcibly displaced Rohingya \r\nwith regard to the prospects for their voluntary return \r\nthat the atrocity crimes that they have been subjected \r\nto are duly accounted for and the perpetrators brought \r\nto justice.\r\nBangladesh welcomes the decision by the Assembly \r\nof State Parties to activate the Court’s jurisdiction over \r\nthe crime of aggression as of 17 July. We also support \r\nthe three amendments to article 8 of the Rome Statute \r\nand take note of further proposals brought before the \r\nWorking Group on Amendments.\r\nWe stress that the cooperation, assistance and \r\nsupport of State parties to the Rome Statute, as well as \r\nother States, remain critical to ensuring that the mandate \r\nof the ICC is discharged in a sustained and meaningful \r\nmanner. We reiterate the importance of recognizing \r\nthe Court’s mandate and competence throughout the \r\nUnited Nations system with a view to acknowledging \r\nits valuable contribution to international peace and \r\nsecurity, the rule of law and the creation of peaceful, \r\njust and inclusive societies. We take positive note of \r\nthe collaboration pursued between UNESCO and the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor to protect cultural heritage \r\nfrom attack during armed conflicts.\r\nWe underscore the need for the Security Council’s \r\ncontinued support for the effective functioning of \r\nthe Court, including in the cases referred to it by the \r\nCouncil. There is clear merit in the suggestion for \r\na structured dialogue between the Council and the \r\nCourt on issues of mutual interest, notably in relation \r\nto States’ non-cooperation, sanctions, travel bans and \r\nasset freezes. For our part, we shall continue to extend \r\nall necessary cooperation to the Court in mission \r\nareas where our peacekeepers and military observers \r\nare deployed.\r\nBangladesh reaffirms the primary responsibility of \r\nnational jurisdictions to investigate and prosecute the \r\ncrimes defined in the Rome Statute. We fully endorse \r\nthe recommendation for the possible inclusion of issues \r\nrelated to the Rome Statute in legal and judicial reform \r\nprogrammes supported by the United Nations in the \r\ncontext of development assistance for the rule of law. \r\nThat would be particularly crucial for States that are \r\nnot party to the Rome Statute.\r\nAs a State party, Bangladesh remains committed \r\nto promoting the universality and full implementation \r\nof the Rome Statute. We would hope that the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich was observed last year, will help create the \r\nnecessary impetus for the eventual universalization \r\nof the Statute. ICC cooperation seminars and other \r\ncooperation arrangements with relevant international \r\nand regional organizations should also contribute to the \r\nuniversalization agenda.\r\nBangladesh underscores the need for appropriate \r\ncapacity-building support for the national jurisdictions \r\nof States parties, pursuant to the principle of \r\ncomplementarity. In that context, we reiterate the \r\nimportance of considering budgetary support for \r\ninternships and visiting professional programmes \r\nfor applicants from States parties representing the \r\ndeveloping and least-developed countries. We have \r\ncirculated a working paper on that subject for favourable \r\nconsideration by all States parties and the Court. We \r\nreiterate that due attention must be given to ensuring \r\nthe equitable geographical representation of the staff at \r\nthe Court, especially at the professional level.\r\nWe consider it important to enhance voluntary \r\ncontributions to the Trust Fund for Victims so that \r\nthe Court can deliver on its reparations and assistance \r\nmandates. As the designated facilitator, Bangladesh \r\nis making efforts to engage with the States parties \r\nconcerned to settle their outstanding arrears. We \r\nalso look forward to discharging our responsibilities \r\nas a member of the ICC Bureau during the next two-\r\nyear period.\r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n22/31 18-34919\r\nIn conclusion, we want to emphasize the importance \r\nof upholding solidarity among States parties, as well as \r\nthe integrity and credibility of the ICC as a court of last \r\nresort, in the overarching interest of fighting impunity \r\nfor the gravest crimes under international law that are \r\nunder its jurisdiction.\r\nMs. Roopnarine (Trinidad and Tobago): Trinidad \r\nand Tobago is grateful to the Secretary-General for \r\nthe annual report of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) contained in document A/73/334 and supporting \r\ndocuments on the activities of the Court in 2017 \r\nand 2018. We view those documents as important \r\ninstruments that convey essential information on the \r\nactivities of the Court to the wider membership of the \r\nUnited Nations as well as States parties. We also want \r\nto take this opportunity to congratulate the President of \r\nthe ICC, Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji, on his presentation \r\nof the report.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago was a participant in the \r\ntrenches during the genesis of the Rome Statute, \r\nthrough the work of our late former Prime Minister \r\nand subsequent President of the Republic of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago. We are therefore pleased to join others in \r\ncelebrating the twentieth anniversary of the founding \r\ndocument of the ICC. The praise of the international \r\ncommunity is well placed and well merited.\r\nWe submit that the ICC is both an international \r\nguardian and guarantor of the rule of law. Indeed, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago’s unwavering commitment to the \r\nICC is informed by its recognition of the importance \r\nof ending impunity for perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes of concern to the international community as \r\noutlined in article 5 of the Rome Statute, that is, the \r\ncrime of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes \r\nand crimes of aggression.\r\nWe welcome the activation of the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nover the crime of aggression as of 17 July. Trinidad and \r\nTobago ratified the amendments concerning the crime \r\nof aggression in November 2012, following the Review \r\nConference of the Rome Statute in Kampala in 2010. \r\nWe view that development as a means to ensure that the \r\nCourt is able to exercise wider jurisdiction, including \r\nover crimes of aggression, thereby preventing impunity.\r\nNotwithstanding the many challenges facing the \r\nCourt, it cannot be denied that the ICC continues to be \r\na beacon of hope to the victims of grave crimes within \r\nits jurisdiction who are seeking justice. They include \r\nthe most vulnerable, such as thousands of women and \r\nchildren, who are often the ones most affected by the \r\nactions of criminals who show blatant disregard for \r\nthe sanctity of human life by violating international \r\nhumanitarian and human rights law.\r\nWe nonetheless remain deeply concerned about \r\nthe recent withdrawals and notifications of withdrawal \r\nfrom the Rome Statute, as highlighted in the current \r\nreport. While respecting the sovereign right of States to \r\nact as they deem appropriate, Trinidad and Tobago is of \r\nthe view that engagement, not disengagement, should \r\nbe the prevailing approach to the ICC.\r\nWe recognize that the ICC has been perceived by \r\nsome as a threat to national sovereignty. However, we \r\nwant to demystify that notion and remind Member States \r\nthat consistent with the principle of complementarity as \r\nenshrined in the Rome Statute, the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nis invoked only when States are unable or unwilling to \r\nprosecute those alleged to have committed grave crimes. \r\nNo individual or State need fear the ICC, therefore, as it \r\nis a court of last resort.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago reaffirms that the success of \r\nthe Court is fundamentally linked to the universality \r\nof the Rome Statute. To that end, we reiterate our \r\ncommitment to promoting the universality of the Rome \r\nStatute, and we urge all States that have not yet done so \r\nto ratify and fully implement it.\r\nPursuant to the provisions of the Relationship \r\nAgreement, which provides for close cooperation \r\nbetween the Court and the United Nations in discharging \r\ntheir respective responsibilities, we are satisfied that \r\nduring the current reporting period, the United Nations \r\ncooperated extensively with the Court with a view to \r\nfurther strengthening the relationship and ensuring \r\nthe effective implementation of the Agreement. In \r\naccordance with the report of the Secretary-General on \r\nthis item, we would like to recall that the capacity of \r\nthe Security Council to refer a situation to the Court \r\nis crucial to our efforts to promote accountability, but \r\nactive follow-up on referrals, ensuring that there will \r\nbe cooperation, is necessary in order to ensure that \r\njustice is delivered. We therefore welcome the dialogue \r\non 6 July between the States parties to the Court that \r\nare members of the Council through the convening of \r\nan Arria Formula meeting, the first of that nature.\r\nFinally, Trinidad and Tobago commends the efforts \r\nof the Court to ensure that justice can prevail and that \r\ncriminals are not allowed to continue their actions \r\nwith impunity. We remain satisfied with the steadfast \r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 23/31\r\ncommitment and hard work on the part of the Court’s \r\nProsecutor, who continues to discharge her mandate in \r\nline with the provisions of the Rome Statute of the ICC.\r\nMr. Suan (Myanmar): Paragraphs 43 and 44 of \r\nthe report of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\n(see A/73/334) mention the Prosecutor’s submission of \r\na request for a ruling of the Pre-trial Chamber as to \r\nwhether the Court might exercise jurisdiction on the \r\nalleged deportation of the so-called Rohingya from \r\nMyanmar to Bangladesh. Consequently, on 6 September, \r\nPre-trial Chamber 1 ruled by a majority decision that \r\nthe Court may exercise jurisdiction over Myanmar.\r\nMyanmar resolutely rejects that decision, which \r\nresults from faulty procedure and is of dubious legal \r\nmerit. I would like to reiterate my Government’s \r\nposition that since Myanmar is not a party to the Rome \r\nStatute, it is under no obligation to respect the findings \r\nof the Court. The decision was the result of manifest \r\nbad faith, procedural irregularities and a general lack of \r\ntransparency. Permission was given to organizations to \r\nfile amicus curiae submissions without consideration of \r\ntheir identity or of the beneficial scope of their proposed \r\ncontributions. Several of the briefs submitted did not \r\naddress legal issues, in fact. Furthermore, allegations \r\nconsisting of emotionally charged narratives of \r\nharrowing personal tragedies, which have nothing to do \r\nwith the legal arguments in question, were permitted, \r\nputting emotional pressure on the Court. Submissions \r\nof observations by those groups had the intended effect \r\nof placing the Court in an emotional bind.\r\nThe Prosecutor incorrectly applied article 19 (3) of \r\nthe Statute in her request for a ruling from the Court on \r\njurisdiction at a time when the Court was not properly \r\nseized of the matter. In that respect, Judge Marc Perrin \r\nde Brichambaut shared his view that articles 19 (3) and \r\n119 (1) of the Rome Statute are inapplicable and that \r\nthe competence-competence doctrine cannot serve \r\nas an alternative basis for the Chamber to provide a \r\nruling. Myanmar also disagrees with the Prosecutor’s \r\nassertion that population displacement across a \r\nnational boundary is an essential objective element of \r\nthe crime of deportation, as set out in article 7 (1) (d) \r\nof the Statute.\r\nFurthermore, there is no organizational policy of \r\nthe kind required for proving crimes against humanity \r\nunder the Rome Statute. Such a policy would be hard \r\nto reconcile with the repatriation agreement signed \r\nbetween Myanmar and Bangladesh in November 2017, \r\nwhereby both countries agreed on a short time frame for \r\nthe voluntary return of all those who fled Rakhine state \r\nas a result of hostilities in the region. Myanmar and \r\nBangladesh also signed the terms of reference for the \r\njoint working group and the physical arrangement for \r\nthe repatriation of displaced Myanmar residents from \r\nBangladesh. All of those bilateral agreements are aimed \r\nat facilitating the repatriation of verified residents of \r\nRakhine state who crossed over to Bangladesh following \r\nthe Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army terrorist attacks \r\nin October 2016 and August 2017. There was no cap \r\non the number to be repatriated, and the process was \r\nintended to begin on 23 January 2018.\r\nMoreover, the Myanmar Government also signed a \r\nmemorandum of understanding with the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees on 6 June 2018. \r\nThe memorandum seeks United Nations participation \r\nin coordinating and harmonizing humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment action in Rakhine state and in assisting \r\nthe Government of Myanmar in the voluntary, safe and \r\ndignified return of displaced persons from Rakhine \r\nstate who have been duly verified as residents of \r\nMyanmar, in line with the physical arrangement. In \r\naccordance with the memorandum of understanding, \r\nthe United Nations team has already completed the first \r\nphase of its field assessment in 23 villages in northern \r\nRakhine. It is now undertaking the second phase of the \r\nfield assessment in an additional 26 villages.\r\nThe Government of Myanmar is aware of \r\naccusations regarding human rights violations in the \r\naftermath of the August 2017 terrorist attacks. In line \r\nwith the Government’s commitment to the rule of law, \r\nan Independent Commission of Inquiry was established \r\non 30 July. The Commission consists of two prominent \r\ninternational personalities and two national members. \r\nThe Commission will investigate allegations of human \r\nrights violations and related issues following the terror \r\nattacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. \r\nThe Government of Myanmar is committed to taking \r\nnecessary action based on the Commission’s findings. \r\nWe are willing and able to take on the accountability \r\nissues for any alleged human rights violation where \r\nthere is sufficient evidence.\r\nThe Government of Myanmar is now undertaking in \r\nearnest the preparation of the necessary conditions that \r\nwould be conducive to the safe, voluntary and dignified \r\nrepatriation of the people who fled to Bangladesh. \r\nIn accordance with the bilateral agreements and \r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n24/31 18-34919\r\narrangements concluded with Bangladesh, Myanmar \r\nhas been ready to receive the first batch of verified \r\nreturnees since January.\r\nDuring the high-level week of the current session \r\nof the General Assembly, an informal meeting was \r\nheld between China, Myanmar and Bangladesh with \r\nthe presence of the Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres. It \r\nreached a three-point consensus on resolving the issue of \r\ndisplaced persons in a friendly and expeditious manner. \r\nAs a result, a third meeting of the Joint Working Group \r\nwill be held on 29 and 30 October in Dhaka to work \r\nout detailed arrangements for the first repatriation as \r\nsoon as possible. I can assure the Assembly that the \r\nfirst group of verified displaced persons will be able to \r\nreturn to Rakhine state very soon.\r\nThe Court’s overextended application of \r\njurisdiction challenges the fundamental principle of \r\nlegal certainty and is contrary to the accepted principles \r\nof public international law. It has created a dangerous \r\nprecedent and erodes the moral authority of the Court. \r\nNowhere in the Rome Statue of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) does it say that the Court has \r\njurisdiction over States that have not accepted that \r\njurisdiction. Furthermore, the 1969 Vienna Convention \r\non the Law of Treaties between States and International \r\nOrganizations or between International Organizations \r\nstates that no treaty can be imposed on a country that has \r\nnot ratified it. What the Prosecutor is attempting to do \r\nis to override the principles of national sovereignty and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States, \r\ncontrary to the principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and recalled in the preamble to \r\nthe Rome Statute. I would also like to state that we \r\nstrongly deplore and reject attempts made by some \r\nStates Members of the United Nations to refer this case \r\ninvolving Myanmar to the ICC. We will never recognize \r\ndiscriminatory, selective, biased, politically motivated \r\nand illegitimate ICC jurisdiction over Myanmar.\r\nFinally, my delegation dissociates itself from the \r\ndraft resolution (A/73/L.8) to be adopted this afternoon.\r\nMr. Hwang Woo Jin (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express my sincere appreciation \r\nto the President of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), Judge Eboe-Osuji, for his comprehensive \r\npresentation of the report (see A/73/334). My delegation \r\nalso commends the joint efforts by the presidency, the \r\nChambers, the Office of the Prosecutor and the Registry \r\nto help end impunity for perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes of concern to the international community.\r\nAfter the successful ceremony this past summer \r\ncelebrating the twentieth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Rome Statute, now is the time for the United \r\nNations and the International Criminal Court to work \r\nmore closely together and to reassert the relevance and \r\nimportance of international criminal justice in securing \r\nthe rule of law and international peace and security.\r\nWe cannot overemphasize the significant role that \r\nthe ICC has played in sustaining the three pillars of \r\nthe United Nations — peace and security, development \r\nand human rights. Securing criminal justice for the \r\nperpetrators of heinous crimes that shock the conscience \r\nof humanity is a cornerstone of the rule of law that \r\nprovides a solid basis for the successful implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is \r\nfor that reason that we support the ongoing cooperation \r\nbetween the ICC and the United Nations at various \r\nlevels, as described in the report.\r\nWhile the progress that the ICC has made on its \r\npath to ending impunity is quite remarkable, it has also \r\nbeen facing some harsh realities on various fronts. We \r\nhope that with the help of its stakeholders, the Court \r\nwill rise above those considerable challenges to firmly \r\nestablish itself as a robust and reliable institution for \r\ninternational criminal justice.\r\nFirst, as an international court, the ICC cannot \r\nsustain itself without active cooperation at each and \r\nevery step from multiple stakeholders, especially \r\nStates parties and the United Nations. In order to \r\nenhance cooperation with States, it is crucial that the \r\nCourt also reach out to interested regions, States and \r\nrelevant organizations. Since the cooperation between \r\nthe ICC and the United Nations, especially the Security \r\nCouncil, is vital to the proper functioning of the system, \r\nit was notable that on 6 July the Security Council \r\nheld an Arria Formula meeting on relations between \r\nthe Council and the ICC in which both the President \r\nof the Assembly of States Parties and the Prosecutor \r\nparticipated as briefers.\r\nSecondly, the success of our fight against impunity \r\nhinges not only on adequate cooperation but also on the \r\nuniversal application of the Rome Statute. The number of \r\nStates parties to the Statute has more than doubled since \r\nits entry into force in 2002, a remarkable achievement \r\nindeed. Nevertheless, the number still falls short of two \r\nthirds of the States Members of the United Nations. \r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 25/31\r\nWider participation by States in the Statute would \r\nundoubtedly lead to stronger support for the Court. And \r\nthe States newly joining the ICC would be investing not \r\nonly in the protection of their territories and peoples \r\nbut also in the protection of future generations and the \r\ncreation of a more just world. We should be aware that \r\nthe ratification of the Rome Statute by a State does not \r\nequate to a concession of that State’s sovereignty, given \r\nthe principle of complementarity.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has been a staunch supporter \r\nof the ICC since its inception. We will continue to \r\nbe an important part of the concerted efforts of the \r\ninternational community to establish the ICC as a \r\nresponsible, universal and efficient institution working \r\nto end impunity for perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes against humanity. In that regard, we have full \r\nconfidence in the leadership of the incumbent President \r\nof the Assembly of States Parties, Mr. O-Gon Kwon, \r\nand will continue to provide adequate assistance to him \r\nas he discharges his important duty.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating the Republic of \r\nKorea’s strong support for the ICC.\r\nMr. Ly (Senegal) (spoke in French): Like other \r\nspeakers before me, on behalf of my country I would \r\nlike to congratulate the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC), Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji, for \r\nhis election to lead that important institution. I would \r\nalso like to thank him for his presentation of the \r\nreport on the Court’s activities (see A/73/334), which \r\ndemonstrates its importance in our universal fight \r\nagainst impunity and for respect for the rule of law. His \r\npresentation is taking place in the context of a general \r\nerosion of the international legal order and multifaceted \r\ncriticism of the ICC. But it is also taking place at a time \r\nof accountability, in which demands for justice and \r\nreparations for the wrongs suffered by victims cannot \r\nbe ignored.\r\nSenegal has always supported the path of dialogue \r\nin promoting peaceful and mutually trusting relations \r\nbetween States and the Court, because we believe \r\nthat the fight against impunity and for the rule of law \r\nmust be a universal struggle on the part of the entire \r\ninternational community. In that respect, we are of \r\nthe view that dialogue and cooperation are the most \r\neffective ways to deal with the concerns of others and \r\nchange the negative, if unjustified, perceptions of the \r\nCourt. That is why we have consistently urged all States \r\nto engage in a consensual, unified and interdependent \r\ndynamic and in a spirit of wisdom and discernment, \r\nso that the trust and enthusiasm that the peoples and \r\nleaders of the world placed in the Court when it was \r\ncreated 20 years ago can be restored.\r\nWe must listen to one another and constructively \r\ndiscuss and deal with the concerns expressed by States, \r\nall while ensuring the integrity of the Court. The \r\nSecurity Council must act with care and objectivity in \r\nexercising its right to refer matters to the Court, so as \r\nto avoid the perception that it is using the Court as a \r\npolitical tool. As for the Court, in order to avoid the \r\nrisk of tarnishing its credibility, it must continue to \r\napply the highest trial standards, respecting the rights \r\nof both the defence and the prosecution and protecting \r\nthe integrity of witnesses unfailingly.\r\nThe review of the report before the General \r\nAssembly today is a convincing barometer of the first \r\nand only permanent international court in charge of \r\nprosecuting mass crimes. The Court has demonstrated \r\nremarkable resilience in the face of adversity, and it \r\nwill undoubtedly prevail. Since its creation, the Court \r\nhas received a total of 26 cases, involving 41 suspects \r\nor defendants, and has investigated 11 cases. During \r\nthe reporting period it issued new arrest warrants for \r\ntwo persons, one of whom has appeared before it. It \r\nconducted three trials, rendered final judgments in two \r\ncases before the Appeals Chamber and handed down \r\nseveral important decisions concerning reparation for \r\nvictims. Preliminary examinations by the Office of the \r\nProsecutor, involving 11 cases around the world, as well \r\nas the opening of a new investigation, support our belief \r\nthat international criminal justice is slowly but surely \r\nand irreversibly progressing on a path to universality.\r\nLet us acknowledge that today the ICC, despite its \r\nshortcomings, remains the only recourse for victims \r\nof serious crimes when the right to justice cannot be \r\nexercised in situ. Since the Court is a complementary \r\nmechanism of last resort, it remains crucial for us to \r\nmake every effort to strengthen the capacity of States \r\nto investigate and prosecute crimes committed on a \r\nlarge scale and to prosecute their perpetrators. When \r\nall is said and done, since the Rome Statute establishes \r\nonly a court of last resort that targets neither States nor \r\nregions but rather aims to protect victims, the primary \r\nresponsibility of States to investigate and try the \r\natrocious crimes defined in the Statute remains.\r\nLet us also acknowledge that the Court, despite its \r\nrelative youth, is recognized today as a major institution \r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n26/31 18-34919\r\nin a functioning and maturing international criminal \r\njustice system. In that respect, it deserves the support \r\nof the international community in a world where \r\nmassive violations continue to strike innocent people \r\nbefore our eyes and where in many cases such crimes \r\ngo unpunished at the State level or are even erased from \r\npeople’s memory.\r\nThe universal ratification of the Rome Statute \r\nand the integration of those norms into the domestic \r\nlaws of States must be made a reality if we want all \r\nvictims across the globe, wherever they live, to have an \r\nequal and fair chance to obtain justice, and if we want \r\nto enhance the effectiveness, legitimacy and capacity \r\nof the Court to contribute to the rule of law, justice, \r\npeace and sustainable development. All Member States \r\nshould always remember that the prevention of conflicts \r\nand the pursuit of peace and effective universal justice, \r\nwhich is the deepest aspiration of all peoples, require \r\nthat all countries around the world work together within \r\nthe framework of the Rome Statute.\r\nI would like to conclude by saying that justice for \r\nthose victims must remain a priority for the international \r\ncommunity. Our daily action should be based only on \r\nprotecting those victims so that the tree of hope planted \r\n20 years ago in Rome continues to f lourish forever \r\nbetween the dunes of The Hague and the North Sea. \r\nMay it be so.\r\nMr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): First of all, I would like to welcome and thank \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court, \r\nMr. Chile Eboe-Osuji, for his extensive, valuable, \r\ndetailed and enlightening report on the judicial \r\nactivities of the Court (see A/73/334), as well as for \r\nhighlighting the many ways in which the United Nations \r\nand States have cooperated with the International \r\nCriminal Court during the period under review. I also \r\nwant to congratulate him on his brilliant election to the \r\npresidency of that body.\r\nOn the whole, we note and agree that the Court has \r\ncarried out actions of special relevance. In that regard \r\nwe welcome the consensus decision to activate the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, as \r\nwell as the continued cooperation and support of the \r\nUnited Nations for the Court.\r\nAs we have reiterated on many occasions in this \r\nHall, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea supports \r\nrespect for international law and international \r\nhumanitarian law, which is why we commend the great \r\nefforts by States and the United Nations, especially the \r\nSecurity Council, as well as the Court, in ensuring its \r\nongoing work on holding accountable all perpetrators \r\nof war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, \r\namong others. We also commend the Court for its \r\nextraordinary zeal in establishing institutions and \r\nmethods to combat pervasive impunity. However, we \r\nbelieve that if the Court is to be able to comply with \r\nits mandate, it requires strong cooperation from States \r\nparties and other States, a cooperation that is being \r\neroded owing to the lack of credibility of the Court, \r\nwhich results from its failure to execute its duties \r\neffectively, honestly and transparently in several cases.\r\nWhile it is true that the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court are closely linked, \r\ntheir respective aims show that they are independent \r\norganizations with different mandates. It is therefore \r\nvital to preserve the difference between the Security \r\nCouncil and the International Criminal Court. \r\nNevertheless, the international community expects \r\nboth organizations to perform their functions in their \r\nrespective areas of competence with objectivity, \r\ncredibility and impartiality, and to avoid politicizing the \r\nCourt. In that context, we are very concerned about the \r\nselectivity with which the competent institutions of the \r\nUnited Nations have referred lawsuits under article 16 \r\nof the Rome Statute, owing to political considerations \r\nthat apparently play a major role in such referrals. That \r\nalso raises questions about the independence of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court.\r\nIn those circumstances, we encourage the \r\ninstitutions of the United Nations to examine the \r\nreferral of new cases to the Court in application of \r\nthe possibility offered by article 13 of the Rome \r\nStatute extremely carefully. We believe that one of \r\nthe important factors that should be evaluated when \r\nconsidering the eventual referral of a situation to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court is the existence or lack of \r\nlegal norms and judicial institutions in the country in \r\nquestion, and therefore whether it will be appropriate \r\nto file an objection with the Court at a later date, \r\nbased on whether the principle of complementarity has \r\nbeen observed.\r\nWith regard to the International Criminal Court \r\nproceedings concerning Mr. Omar Al-Bashir, President \r\nof the Sudan, we would like to point out that Equatorial \r\nGuinea adheres to all the declarations and resolutions \r\nissued by the African Union regarding the manner in \r\nwhich the Court has dealt with some African issues, \r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 27/31\r\nand especially with regard to the proceedings against \r\nthe President of the Sudan. We are of the view that \r\nthe Court does not have jurisdiction to indict a Head \r\nof State, since, as the symbol of national sovereignty, \r\nhe enjoys full immunity. Besides that, the Court is \r\nexpected to act only in countries that are party to it, \r\nunless a non-party State requests its cooperation in \r\ncriminal matters and deems it necessary to cooperate \r\nwith the Court.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to urge the United \r\nNations and the Court to devote more of their efforts \r\nto assisting and training national judicial institutions \r\nin order to achieve closer and more effective \r\ncooperation between the Court and States that request \r\nsuch assistance.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): We have \r\nheard the last speaker on this agenda item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.8.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to delegations that wish to \r\nspeak in explanation of position before the adoption of \r\nthe draft resolution, I would like to remind speakers \r\nthat explanations are limited to 10 minutes and should \r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Palau-Hernandez (United States of America): \r\nThe United States recently announced a change in its \r\npolicy regarding the International Criminal Court (ICC). \r\nThe reasons for that change in policy have been made \r\npublic, including in the speech delivered 10 September \r\nby our National Security Advisor, Mr. John Bolton, and \r\nare widely available. We will therefore not repeat them \r\nat length here.\r\nThe United States reiterates its continuing and \r\nlong-standing principled objection to any assertion of \r\nICC jurisdiction over nationals of States that are not \r\nparty to the Rome Statute, including the United States \r\nand Israel, without a Security Council referral or the \r\nconsent of such a State.\r\nWe also wish to reiterate our serious and \r\nfundamental concerns about the ICC Prosecutor’s \r\nproposed investigation of United States personnel in \r\nthe context of the conflict in Afghanistan. The United \r\nStates remains a leader in the fight to end impunity and \r\nsupports justice and accountability for international \r\ncrimes, including war crimes, crimes against humanity \r\nand genocide. The United States respects the decisions \r\nof nations that have chosen to join the ICC, and in turn \r\nwe expect that our decision not to join and not to place \r\nour citizens under the Court’s jurisdiction will also be \r\nrespected. Accordingly, the United States dissociates \r\nitself from the consensus on draft resolution A/73/L.8.\r\nMr. Ahmed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\npoliticization of international justice in order to attain \r\nspecific goals or serve specific narrow interests does not \r\nconsort with the efforts of the international community \r\nto achieve justice and remain faithful to the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nSuch politicization violates established principles of \r\ninternational law and foments tension in international \r\nrelations rather than promoting their improvement \r\nas one of the primary objectives underlying the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations.\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has clearly \r\ndemonstrated that it is merely a tool used in international \r\nstruggles and a political instrument. That is why \r\nthe Sudan reiterates its clear and steadfast position \r\nrejecting the Court and its practices, since it represents \r\na platform that seeks to politicize international justice, \r\ntarget African leaders and threaten peace and stability \r\nin African countries.\r\nMy delegation reiterates the importance of \r\ncombating impunity and achieving justice through \r\nnational judicial bodies that are authorized and capable \r\nof exercising national competence and achieving justice. \r\nNational judicial bodies are supposed to do that without \r\nforeign intervention or guardianship. My country \r\npossesses its own national judicial system capable of \r\nestablishing national jurisdiction and achieving justice.\r\nThe continued attempts to turn the General \r\nAssembly into an assembly for States parties to the \r\nICC represent a violation of the Charter and contradict \r\nestablished principles enshrined in international law. \r\nThe Sudan reiterates its full and unequivocal refusal \r\nto deal with the Court. We are not a State party to the \r\nRome Statute, and we have made no commitments to it. \r\nIn that connection, the relevant provisions of the Vienna \r\nConvention on the Law of Treaties, international law \r\nand international customary law should be borne in \r\nmind. The continued attempts to make the General \r\nAssembly an assembly for States parties to the Court \r\nwill always constitute a violation of the Charter and run \r\ncounter to the principles I have mentioned.\r\nThe ICC is a separate entity that has no organic \r\nrelationship with the United Nations. There are no \r\ncommitments with regard to it incumbent on States \r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n28/31 18-34919\r\nother than those assumed by parties to the Court. \r\nOn that basis, the draft resolution that is about to be \r\nadopted (A/73/L.8) is of no relevance to the Sudan, and \r\nwe will attach no weight to it. We dissociate ourselves \r\nfrom it and would like our position on it to be reflected \r\nin the meeting record.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in explanation of vote before the \r\nvoting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.8, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat since the submission of the draft resolution, and \r\nin addition to those delegations listed in the document, \r\nthe following countries have also become sponsors of \r\nA/73/L.8: Andorra, Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, \r\nBelgium, Botswana, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, \r\nthe Czech Republic, El Salvador, France, Germany, \r\nHungary, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, \r\nNorway, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, the Republic \r\nof Korea, Saint Lucia, Samoa, San Marino, Sweden, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Trinidad and \r\nTobago, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland, Uruguay and Vanuatu.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): May I \r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.8?\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.8 was adopted \r\n(resolution 73/7).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): Before \r\ngiving the f loor for explanations of vote after the voting, \r\nI would like to remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Al Arsan (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I would like to stress that my \r\ndelegation dissociates itself from any consensus on \r\nresolution 73/7, which has just been adopted. The \r\nSyrian Arab Republic has been and remains opposed to \r\nsuspicious and unfounded attempts by the Governments \r\nof certain Member States to expand the scope of \r\nuniversal jurisdiction in a distorted and illegitimate \r\nmanner, as well as those who treat the concepts of \r\njustice, accountability and the prevention of impunity \r\nin a politicized, partial and unbalanced way. Such an \r\napproach serves only to undermine State sovereignty \r\nand infringe on the mandates of national legal and \r\njudicial institutions.\r\nSyria was one of the first countries to actively \r\ncontribute to the negotiations on the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich established the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC). Syria was also one of the first countries to become \r\na signatory to the Statute. However, when we look back \r\nafter all these years at the nature of the work of the \r\nICC, we see a politicized and manipulated body that is \r\ncapable of acting only against weak countries. Even the \r\nrecent Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute on \r\nthe crime of aggression are a dead letter. Everyone here \r\ntoday knows that it will be impossible to implement \r\nthe amendments, because the Court’s activities are \r\nsubjected to political arrangements and deals.\r\nThe representatives of certain delegations continue \r\nto insist in this Hall on cheap political exploitation of the \r\nsituation in my country, Syria. They have shamelessly, \r\nhypocritically and deceitfully called for the situation in \r\nSyria to be referred to the ICC. Frankly, I find it strange \r\nthat the Permanent Representative of one such State \r\nhas issued a call from this very rostrum for referring \r\nthe situation to the ICC. Perhaps he knows, or perhaps \r\nhe does not know, that his country’s Government has \r\nsigned a bilateral memorandum with another State to \r\nensure impunity for its soldiers and officers so that they \r\ncannot be prosecuted by the ICC.\r\nThere are also certain States that continue to insist \r\nin this Hall on promoting the so-called International, \r\nImpartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the \r\nInvestigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible \r\nfor the Most Serious Crimes under International Law \r\nCommitted in the Syrian Arab Republic since March \r\n2011. They remain responsible for limiting the mandate \r\nof the ICC to certain countries and cases and are now \r\nseeking to cover up the genuine and fundamental \r\nreasons that led various States to withdraw from the \r\nCourt and its Rome Statute. While I did not want to \r\ndelve into that issue or its details, some States have \r\npushed me to do just that.\r\nOn the International, Impartial and Independent \r\nMechanism, I would like to emphasize to the political \r\nhypocrites that the majority of Member States no \r\nlonger want to hear from biased parties who attempt \r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 29/31\r\nto use the General Assembly to promote it. It has been \r\ndemonstrated to all that it is an illegitimate entity that \r\nhas been dead since its inception. It was merely the \r\nconsequence of the General Assembly’s adoption of \r\na resolution without consensus, where the Assembly \r\nwent beyond its specific mandates under Articles 10, \r\n11, 12 and 22 of the Charter. The Mechanism has also \r\ngrossly overstepped the Security Council’s mandates as \r\nprovided for in Article 12 of the Charter.\r\nI do not want to take up the time and effort of the \r\nAssembly by focusing too much on the Mechanism. I \r\ntherefore invite delegations to read the letters addressed \r\nto the Secretary-General and the President of the General \r\nAssembly submitted by our delegation and those of a \r\nnumber of Member States, which give conclusive proof \r\nof its significant legal defects. I would like to refer \r\nin particular to our two letters issued as documents \r\nA/71/799 and A/72/106. I once again stress to the \r\nAssembly that the parties that continue to promote the \r\nso-called Mechanism cannot refute the legal arguments \r\nthat we presented against its establishment. Our legal \r\narguments were based on the Charter and international \r\nlaw, not on a politically biased perspective.\r\nIn conclusion, I call on those who continue to \r\npromote the ICC to bring their words into line with \r\ntheir actions. They must dissociate themselves from the \r\nharsh and unbalanced political reality that the world is \r\nencountering. They should start by holding accountable \r\nthe Governments of States that have supported and \r\nfunded the extremist Salafi jihadi organizations that \r\nare responsible for killing tens of thousands of innocent \r\nSyrians. They should hold accountable Governments \r\nof States that were implicated in the rise and spread \r\nof the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters. Only \r\nthen will we be able to listen to them about achieving \r\nabstract international justice not based on the law of \r\npower, political considerations and narrow interests.\r\nMr. Musikhin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian delegation is committed to the \r\nrule of law at the international level and to combating \r\nimpunity. We are adapting our national criminal legal \r\nsystem in response to current threats and challenges, as \r\nwell as making active use of the applicable mechanisms \r\nfor international cooperation on these issues, while \r\nbeing guided, where applicable, by the principle of \r\nextradite or prosecute.\r\nThe contribution of the current bodies of \r\ninternational justice to the fight against impunity are \r\nnot uniform. The International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nis perhaps the least effective among them. We are \r\ndisappointed that the text of resolution 73/7, on the \r\nreport of the ICC (see A/73/PV.334), has once again \r\nbeen merely technically updated. First, that does not \r\nreflect the real state of affairs in and around the Court, \r\nand secondly, it does not take into account the positions \r\nof States that are not party to the Rome Statute of the \r\nICC. There is little sense, if any, in the adoption of such \r\na resolution.\r\nWe have repeatedly detailed our views on the \r\nactivities of the ICC. Unfortunately, the past year \r\nhas given grounds for an even more pessimistic \r\nassessment. Huge resources have been squandered on \r\nthree convictions throughout the ICC’s 16 years of \r\nexistence. The Court continues to interpret the norms \r\nof international law, including on the immunity of State \r\nofficials, very loosely and often unprofessionally. That \r\nhas resulted in the well-known concerns of a number \r\nof States in Africa and of the African Union, which we \r\nshare. It is symbolic that this year the States of that \r\nregion have initiated the introduction of an item into \r\nthe agenda of the General Assembly on a request for \r\nan advisory opinion from the International Court of \r\nJustice on those issues.\r\nWe are also concerned about the ICC’s desire to \r\nunjustifiably expand its jurisdiction, attempting to draw \r\ninto its orbit States that are not party to the Statute. \r\nThat was particularly clear in the Court’s approach at \r\nthe beginning of the preliminary investigation of the \r\nalleged Rohingya deportations.\r\nThe reputation of the ICC is deteriorating year by \r\nyear. Incidentally, in October 2017, the Office of the \r\nProsecutor of the Court announced the launching of a \r\nfull-f ledged investigation by the Independent Oversight \r\nMechanism into accusations of misconduct on the part \r\nof the Court’s staff, which is alleged to have taken \r\nplace during the investigation of the Libya case. It was \r\nalso reported that a former Prosecutor of the ICC was \r\nembroiled in dubious schemes. However, nothing has \r\nbeen heard about the results of that investigation.\r\nIn sum, the Court has many problems and we will \r\nnot list them all. Yet another State recently announced \r\nits withdrawal from the Rome Statute. We cannot help \r\nnoting that it does not seem that the Court’s activities \r\nhave been able to genuinely help to stabilize situations, \r\nhalt violence or alleviate the plight of civilian populations \r\nin any of the situations under its consideration. In that \r\nA/73/PV.28 29/10/2018\r\n30/31 18-34919\r\nregard, the outcomes of the ICC’s years of work on \r\nsituations referred to it by the Security Council are \r\nparticularly indicative. Given the circumstances I have \r\noutlined, our delegation cannot support this technical \r\nupdate to the text and we dissociate ourselves from the \r\nconsensus on the resolution.\r\nMs. Ponce (Philippines): The Philippines has \r\ndissociated itself from the consensus resolution 73/7. \r\nThe withdrawal of the Philippines from the International \r\nCriminal Court takes effect on 17 March 2019. Our \r\ndecision to withdraw is based on our principled stand \r\nagainst those who politicize human rights, while our \r\ncountry’s independent and well-functioning organs \r\nand agencies continue to exercise jurisdiction over \r\ncomplaints, issues, problems and concerns arising \r\nfrom the Government’s efforts to protect its people. It \r\nis true that as in all democracies, the wheels of justice \r\ngrind slowly and not always exceedingly well, but they \r\ndo turn. We wish that we were able to, but we cannot \r\ngive assurances to well-intentioned critics that we \r\nwill bypass justice so as to give plaintiffs immediate \r\nretribution. That would undermine the rule of law. \r\nWe affirm our commitment to fighting impunity for \r\natrocity crimes, despite our withdrawal from the \r\nRome Statute, especially given that the Philippines has \r\nnational legislation punishing atrocity crimes.\r\nMrs. Weiss (Israel): Israel has decided to \r\ndissociate itself from the consensus resolution 73/7, not \r\nbecause we do not support the noble goals for which \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) was founded \r\nbut rather because we do. Israel was among the first \r\nsupporters of the establishment of a permanent criminal \r\ninstitution, and we continue to believe in the critical \r\nimportance of combating impunity for mass atrocities. \r\nOur position today is a way to give voice to the growing \r\nconcerns that we know are shared by many, including \r\nboth States that are parties and non-parties to the ICC, \r\non the increasing gap that appears to be developing, \r\neven in the view of many of its supporters, between the \r\noriginal mandate of the Court and the way in which the \r\nmandate is being implemented in practice.\r\nThe ICC is a relatively young institution, and those \r\nwho seek to ensure its integrity and effectiveness as a \r\nlegal body have an interest in ensuring that it operates \r\nand is seen to be operating not on the basis of what \r\nmay be politically popular, but on the straightforward, \r\nimpartial and independent application of the terms of \r\nits own Statute. Unfortunately, too many decisions \r\nand actions emanating from the ICC have given \r\ncause for concern in that regard. In the final analysis, \r\nthe credibility, legitimacy and standing of any legal \r\ninstitution is earned, not given. It must be built \r\nincrementally on firm jurisdictional ground, and it \r\nis only as strong as the quality of its legal decisions, \r\nthe integrity of its processes over time and the choices \r\nthat it makes regarding the allocation of its time \r\nand resources.\r\nWhile States parties are called on to respect the \r\nprinciples of independence and impartiality on which \r\nthe Court was founded, we believe that the ICC’s core \r\nmission is harmed rather than advanced when the \r\ninternational community gives it uncritical support \r\nrather than the serious review that is warranted. We \r\nurge States, especially those that are strong supporters \r\nof the Court, as well as other key stakeholders, to be \r\nsensitive to the serious concerns that are being voiced \r\nand to become partners in an effort to better align the \r\nfunctioning of the ICC with its founding principles \r\nand objectives.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in explanation of vote after \r\nthe voting.\r\nSeveral speakers have requested to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. I would like to remind \r\nmembers that statements in the exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first statement \r\nand five minutes for the second and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Suárez Moreno (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): Today the delegation of \r\nPeru, speaking on behalf of Argentina, Canada, Chile, \r\nColombia and Paraguay, spoke out against Venezuela \r\nwithout any legal basis and with the sole purpose \r\nof inflicting political damage. If today’s common \r\nobjective is strengthening multilateral institutions \r\ndedicated to the administration of justice, that will not \r\nbe accomplished by turning the International Criminal \r\nCourt into a battleground for ideological, economic and \r\ngeopolitical interests in the service of a minority group \r\nof countries. The International Criminal Court already \r\nhas enough enemies who have publicly declared their \r\nintention to weaken its international prestige, integrity \r\nand autonomy. The last thing we need is the work of a \r\nnew, now covert group of enemies of the Court trying \r\nto convert it into a tool for carrying out aggression \r\nagainst third countries. They are not strengthening the \r\nCourt that way but rather destroying it.\r\n29/10/2018 A/73/PV.28\r\n18-34919 31/31\r\nWe call on the international community to reject \r\nall manipulations that masquerade as expressions of \r\nconcern about justice but that are actually coordinated \r\npolitical aggression without a basis in reality. They are \r\nin violation of international law and run counter to the \r\nspirit and purpose of the International Criminal Court.\r\nVenezuela reiterates its support for the International \r\nCriminal Court and its independence, integrity and \r\ntransparency with a view to ensuring that those \r\nresponsible for the most serious crimes are brought \r\nto justice. Finally, we call on the Member States of \r\nthe United Nations to adhere strictly to the principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nrules of international law.\r\nMr. Islam (Bangladesh): I am exercising the right \r\nof reply in reference to the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Myanmar.\r\nThe Pre-Trial Chamber’s ruling in the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) confirms the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt over the forced deportation from Myanmar to \r\nBangladesh, which is a State party to the Rome Statute. \r\nThe Myanmar delegation appears to have conflated \r\nthe issue of jurisdiction. We do not agree that the issue \r\nof accountability would be hard to reconcile with the \r\nbilateral agreements between Bangladesh and Myanmar \r\non the question of the safe, dignified and voluntary \r\nreturn of the Rohingya. We have always maintained \r\nthat accountability is a critical aspect in restoring \r\nconfidence among the Rohingya for their return.\r\nBangladesh remains committed to working together \r\nwith Myanmar and any interested Member States \r\nin facilitating the Rohingya repatriation. We expect \r\nMyanmar to initiate the necessary national judicial \r\nmechanisms to prosecute the gravest crimes under \r\ninternational law, including those committed against \r\nthe Rohingya. However, in the face of the repeated \r\nunwillingness of the State concerned to do so, the \r\ninternational community has a responsibility to take \r\naction against impunity. In that regard, the ICC’s role \r\nas the court of last resort can in no way be discounted.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 77?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
