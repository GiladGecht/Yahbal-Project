"United Nations A/73/PV.30\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n30th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 1 November 2018, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 43 (continued)\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/73/85)\r\nDraft resolution (A/73/L.3)\r\nDraft amendments (A/73/L.9 through \r\nA/73/L.16)\r\nMs. McGuire (Grenada): Grenada aligns itself with \r\nthe statements delivered on behalf of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity, the Group of 77 and China, the Movement \r\nof Non-Aligned Countries and the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States (see A/73/PV.29).\r\nGrenada takes the f loor to speak in its national \r\ncapacity on agenda item 43, entitled “Necessity of \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to acknowledge the \r\npresence of Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba.\r\nGrenada maintains its unequivocal opposition \r\nto the imposition of the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against the Government and the \r\npeople of Cuba. This is a matter of grave concern to \r\nGrenada. Grenada shares in the widespread sentiment \r\nof the global community condemning such unilateral \r\nmeasures imposed on sovereign States. Because such \r\nactions are contrary to the tenets of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, the embargo itself runs counter to the \r\nprinciples that the constitutive document sets forth.\r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed with hope and \r\ncommendation the strides taken by the United States \r\nGovernment to re-establish diplomatic relations with \r\nCuba and further implement several policy changes. \r\nBut, alas, we have also witnessed the reversal of those \r\nmeasures. Grenada views the reversal of rapprochement \r\nefforts between the United States of America and the \r\nRepublic of Cuba as unfortunate. We therefore urge \r\nboth parties to return to good-faith dialogue.\r\nWe continue to stand in firm opposition to laws and \r\nmeasures that encroach on and hinder the sovereignty, \r\nterritorial integrity and equality, international trade or \r\nnavigation of any State. Today, we renew our clarion \r\ncall for all necessary steps to be taken to repeal or \r\ninvalidate the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed on the Government and the people \r\nof Cuba.\r\nGrenada continues to believe that, with the support \r\nof multilateralism in this community of nations, there is \r\nstill hope for the return to the normalization of relations \r\nbetween the two Governments in the spirit of true and \r\nsincere reconciliation and for this unilateral imposition \r\nto become a vestige of the past. For it is only in unity \r\nthat we can earnestly fight to overcome the seemingly \r\nmonumental difficulties in this world.\r\nGrenada therefore calls for the immediate lifting \r\nof the unfair economic, commercial and financial \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

As in previous years and with \r\npersistence, our delegation unequivocally joins in the \r\nclamour of the voices of 191 of the 193 States Members \r\nof the United Nations calling for an end to an embargo \r\nthat has gone on for more than half a century and has \r\nbeen harming the noble Cuban people economically, \r\ncommercially, culturally and socially.\r\nTo illustrate the evolution of the situation and \r\ncountries’ positions with statistics, in 1992 59 States \r\nvoted in favour of that year’s resolution, to 3 against, \r\nwith 71 abstentions and 46 absent (resolution 47/19). \r\nIn 2000, 167 voted in favour, to 3 against, with 4 \r\nabstentions and 15 absent (resolution 55/20). In 2015, \r\n191 countries voted in favour, to 2 against, with no \r\nabstentions (resolution 70/5). In 2016, 191 countries \r\nvoted in favour, to none against, with 2 abstentions \r\n(resolution 71/5). In 2017, 191 countries voted in favour, \r\nto 2 against, with no abstentions (resolution 72/4).\r\nWhen, in 2016, aware of the global clamour and \r\noverwhelming call for an end to the embargo, the \r\nGovernment of the United States, through then-\r\nPresident Barack Obama, took initiatives and decisions \r\nfor the realization of that near-unanimous global demand \r\nfrom among the Members of the United Nations, the \r\nworld population in general and the Cuban people in \r\nparticular, we were filled with optimism to finally see \r\nthe fulfilment of such a long-awaited desire. In fact, \r\nthe diplomatic missions of both countries were opened \r\nand trips to the United States and Cuba were conducted \r\nby top leaders of both countries. Commercial f lights \r\nwere resumed and other measures were taken, which \r\nsuggested a promising horizon for the total unblocking \r\nof and the end of the unilateral isolation imposed \r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nIt is with the positive developments of the years \r\n2015 and 2016 in mind that our delegation takes \r\nadvantage of this meeting to once again — as it has \r\ndone and will continue to do — launch an appeal to \r\nthe Government of the United States to continue along \r\nthe path already laid out by President Obama by fully \r\nimplementing resolution 72/4, on the immediate lifting \r\nof the blockade against Cuba in all its aspects. We are \r\ncounting on the United States Government to listen to \r\nthese appeals and this clamour and, as a result, agree \r\nto pursue and strengthen the actions already initiated, \r\nso that when the seventy-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly is held in 2019, this issue will no longer be \r\non the agenda, and so that it will be, by then, relegated \r\nto the annals of history.\r\nDespite the unilateral embargo and isolation \r\nimposed by the United States, Cuba has been able to \r\nachieve very high levels in the human development \r\nindex, with an active and very fruitful South-South \r\ncooperation programme with dozens of countries from \r\ndifferent parts of the planet — including my country, \r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea — with broad \r\neducational and health cooperation. \r\nIf it reached excellent levels of development in \r\nthe health, education, sociocultural and other sectors, \r\ncan we imagine the heights this brave country could \r\nhave reached had it not suffered this unjust embargo \r\nand blockade? Without this embargo and blockade, \r\nCuba would deploy all its productive, scientific, \r\ncommercial, cultural, social, health, educational and \r\nsports potential involved, and its impact would be \r\nmuch greater, with benefits not only for Cuba and the \r\ncountries with which it cooperates, but for many more \r\ncountries in the community of nations.\r\nIn conclusion, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \r\nreiterates that it condemns and opposes the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba, expresses its total solidarity with the \r\nGovernment and the people of Cuba, and once again \r\ncalls on the current United States Government to use \r\nthe mechanisms already established by the previous \r\nAdministration and within the framework of the United \r\nNations by proceeding to the unconditional lifting of \r\nthe embargo against Cuba.\r\n01/11/2018 A/73/PV.30\r\n18-35542 3/24\r\nMr. Suan (Myanmar): First of all, my delegation \r\nwishes to welcome Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba.\r\nThe Myanmar delegation aligns itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representatives of Venezuela, \r\nEgypt and Singapore, on behalf of the Movement of \r\nNon-Aligned Countries, Group of 77 and China, and the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, respectively.\r\nMy delegation joins the overwhelming majority \r\nof United Nations Members in calling for an end to \r\nthe unilateral economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba, which has no justification whatsoever in \r\na multilateral rules-based system.\r\nMyanmar believes in the fundamental principles \r\nof sovereign equality, non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of other States and the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, as enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. We are against the extraterritorial application \r\nof the blockade and the politicization of human rights \r\nissues, as they run counter to international law and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. My delegation has \r\ntherefore consistently supported and voted in favour of \r\nthe annual resolution on this topic for the past 26 years, \r\nand we will continue to do so today.\r\nThe unilateral economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States against Cuba \r\nover the past 56 years has caused considerable suffering \r\nto the people of Cuba. The embargo has significantly \r\naffected the economic, social and environmental \r\ndevelopment of the Cuban people, particularly \r\nits women and children. We fully understand and \r\nsympathize with the people of Cuba in their suffering \r\nand hardship, as, in the recent past and for over two \r\ndecades, we were also subjected to unilateral sanctions.\r\nIt is therefore with great hope that we welcomed \r\nthe rapprochement between Cuba and the United States \r\nwith the resumption of diplomatic relations and the \r\nsubsequent official visit of President Obama to Havana \r\nin 2016. Furthermore, the United States abstained in \r\nthe voting on resolution 75/5 of 26 October 2016. All \r\nof these developments were positive and encouraging \r\nsteps towards ending the 56-year unilateral embargo, \r\nwhich would have benefited both countries.\r\nMyanmar would like to encourage the United \r\nStates and Cuba to continue dialogue and negotiations \r\nto achieve the full normalization of bilateral relations \r\nbased on the principles of sovereign equality and \r\nmutual respect. The total lifting of the embargo would \r\nalleviate the economic and social hardship of the \r\nCuban people, thereby helping their efforts to achieve \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nleave no one behind. It would also contribute to the \r\neconomic development of both countries — the United \r\nStates and Cuba — as well as to the peace, stability and \r\ndevelopment of the region as a whole.\r\nWe are convinced that the United States and \r\nCuba have the wisdom and capacity to overcome \r\nthis protracted political problem between their two \r\ncountries. Myanmar will continue to support every \r\nconstructive effort to end the embargo as soon \r\nas possible.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Cuba.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI wish to express my condolences to the people and \r\nthe authorities of the City of Pittsburgh, the State of \r\nPennsylvania and the United States for the events that \r\ntranspired in the Tree of Life Synagogue, in which 11 \r\npeople were killed. We also express our condolences \r\nto the people and the Government of Indonesia for the \r\nair disaster that occurred on 29 October, in which 189 \r\npeople lost their lives.\r\nOn 25 June, Adam López Macias, a 181-day-old \r\nboy, underwent surgery to correct a life-threatening \r\ncongenital heart defect, the transposition of the great \r\narteries, an anatomical problem in which the arteries \r\nare reversed. The surgery lasted five hours. His \r\nunstable condition, subsequent hypotension, or low \r\nblood pressure, and bradycardia, a slow heartbeat, \r\nmeant that he had to remain with his small sternum \r\nopen until 29 June, that is, for 96 hours.\r\nThe embargo prevents Cuban children suffering \r\nfrom postoperative low cardiac output due to insufficient \r\nblood being pumped by the heart — the most frequent \r\ncomplication of paediatric heart surgery — from \r\nreceiving the best treatment, that is, the advanced \r\npaediatric ventricular assist device, which the \r\nUnited States companies HeartWare Inc., located in \r\nMassachusetts, and Thoratec Corporation, located in \r\nPleasanton, California, manufacture and protect with \r\npatents. How can one measure the suffering of the small \r\nboy and his family? Adam recovered thanks to the \r\nprofessionalism and dedication of the Cuban medical \r\nstaff and the efforts of an entire country.\r\nA/73/PV.30 01/11/2018\r\n4/24 18-35542\r\nOn 13 December 2017, Rosa Esther Navarro \r\nRamirez, who was born at 37 weeks, had to undergo \r\nsurgery. At the time, she was 14 months old, and had \r\nanomalous pulmonary venous drainage, that is, when \r\noxygenated blood mixes with deoxygenated blood. The \r\ngirl then suffered from ventricular fibrillation — a \r\nrapid and irregular heartbeat — and, during 27 days of \r\ngreat distress for her parents, was treated for pulmonary \r\nhypertension, or increased blood pressure in the \r\nsmall lung arteries, without being able to receive the \r\nappropriate drug — inhaled nitric oxide, which cannot \r\nbe readily obtained in an emergency and transported by \r\naeroplane, since it is f lammable and combustible and \r\nrequires special conditions for transportation by sea. \r\nIf there had been no embargo, the medicine could have \r\nswiftly been requested from the United States company \r\nDatex Ohmeda, which produces the beneficial drug \r\nand the system by which it is administered. Rosita was \r\nsaved despite the cruelty of that policy.\r\nA 13-year-old girl from Guantánamo with a \r\nmalignant spinal tumour and a 5-year-old boy from \r\nHavana with a tumour between the brainstem and \r\nthe cerebellum, whose names I clearly must not \r\ndisclose, could not be treated with the optimal drug \r\ntemozolomide, which is manufactured in the United \r\nStates, although they have fortunately recovered from \r\ntheir conditions.\r\nThe company Illumina is the world leader in \r\nnext-generation sequencing, which ensures the most \r\naccurate cancer diagnosis and is the basis for precision \r\nmedicine and the specialized treatment of patients. The \r\nsuppliers of specialized drugs usually require that type \r\nof diagnosis in order to administer them.\r\nIn 2017, 224 people per 100,000 inhabitants died \r\nin Cuba because they did not have access to those \r\ntreatments due to the embargo. In the past year, more \r\nthan 30 United States companies, including Agilent, \r\nCook Medical and Thermo Fisher Scientific, refused \r\nto sell drugs, supplies and equipment essential to our \r\nhealth system through the company Medicuba or did \r\nnot respond to its repeated requests. No mother in this \r\nHall or on this planet can help but be moved by the \r\ncases I have described.\r\nThe human harm caused by the embargo, which \r\nqualifies as an act of genocide under article 2 (b) and \r\n(c) of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment \r\nof the Crime of Genocide of 1948, is incalculable. \r\nIt is even a violation of international humanitarian \r\nlaw. The human suffering cannot be measured. The \r\npurpose of the embargo, anchored in the Cold War, \r\nhas remained unchanged over time. The infamous \r\nclassified memorandum of 6 April 1960 from the \r\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State, Lester Mallory, \r\nguides the current United States Administration’s Cuba \r\npolicy, stating:\r\n“There is no effective political opposition ... \r\nThe only foreseeable means of alienating internal \r\nsupport is through disenchantment and disaffection \r\nbased on economic dissatisfaction and hardship \r\n... every possible means should be undertaken \r\npromptly to weaken the economic life of Cuba... \r\ndenying money and supplies to Cuba to decrease \r\nmonetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, \r\ndesperation and overthrow of government.”\r\nAs an exception, we welcome the recent signing of \r\nan agreement, under a special licence that has existed \r\nsince 2016, that established a joint venture between the \r\nmarketing agency of the Cuban Centre of Molecular \r\nImmunology and the Roswell Park Cancer Center, \r\nwhich will allow for therapeutic vaccines manufactured \r\nwith Cuban technology to treat head, neck and lung \r\ncancer to be sold in the United States. Under a special \r\nlicence issued in 2017, Cuba will also be allowed to buy \r\n81,000 doses of the hormonal contraceptive Mesigyna \r\nfrom a United States subsidiary of the Bayer company.\r\nMoreover, the embargo is the main obstacle to the \r\nf low of information and broader access to the Internet \r\nand information and communication technologies for \r\nall Cubans, since it hinders connectivity and makes it \r\nmore expensive in the archipelago, restricts access to \r\ntheir platforms and technologies and uses cyberspace \r\nfor actions aimed at regime change.\r\nThe embargo also obstructs cultural, academic, \r\nscientific, sports and civil society exchanges. In \r\nexercising that hostile policy, the United States \r\nGovernment, under unbelievable pretexts and for truly \r\npolitical reasons, fails to comply with the number \r\nof immigrant visas for Cubans agreed as part of the \r\nmigration agreements in force. It has made family \r\nreunification and temporary visits by Cubans to their \r\ncountry more difficult and increased the cost and \r\nhas restricted family ties. The blockade is a f lagrant, \r\nmassive and systematic violation of Cubans’ human \r\nrights, and has been and continues to be a major \r\nimpediment to several generations who yearn for their \r\nwell-being and prosperity.\r\n01/11/2018 A/73/PV.30\r\n18-35542 5/24\r\nThese policies also affect Cubans residing in the \r\nUnited States. Furthermore, the blockade is oppressive \r\nfor United States citizens, as it unjustly and arbitrarily \r\nrestricts the freedom to travel to Cuba — the only \r\ndestination in the world forbidden to them.\r\nThe United States Government is crudely \r\nmanipulating and politicizing the universal desire \r\nfor human rights for all and for the implementation \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals through draft \r\namendments A/73/L.9 through A/73/L.16, which it \r\nhas proposed with the sole purpose of adulterating the \r\nnature and focus of the annual resolution against the \r\nblockade, which the Assembly has adopted 26 times, \r\nand the goal of fabricating a pretext to find some sort \r\nof international endorsement to continue to tighten \r\nit, which the Assembly will not allow. A shameless \r\nmemorandum that the State Department circulated \r\nlast week to accredited diplomats, which I have in my \r\nhands, acknowledges that, “Our proposed amendments \r\nare intended to address the underlying reason for the \r\nembargo.” In the same document, the State Department \r\npoints out with unabashed cynicism,\r\n“Last year, direct reference was made to the United \r\nStates embargo undermining collective efforts to \r\nimplement the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nWe heard [the delegations] loud and clear. Cuba’s \r\nactions clearly threaten those Goals, and, in order to \r\nfully implement them, we need [those delegations’] \r\nsupport on amendments.”\r\nThat acknowledges the lack of respect that the \r\nAmbassador of the United States to the United \r\nNations and the State Department have for the United \r\nNations, multilateralism and the General Assembly, \r\nwhich, last year, she called a “political theatre” (A/72/\r\nPV.38, p. 9). This recently circulated memorandum \r\ntruly makes a mockery of multilateralism, decency \r\nin international politics and the great, universal and \r\ndemocratic Assembly.\r\nI also call attention to the fact that the memorandum \r\nmisleadingly implies that the text of the amendments \r\nwas previously agreed so as to surreptitiously introduce \r\nother contents referring to another issue, by another \r\nbody and another country. Once again, we see the \r\npractice of lying, deceit and immorality in political \r\ndiscourse. Draft amendment A/73/L.7, which originally \r\nwas a single amendment comprised of eight paragraphs, \r\nwas later transformed into eight separate amendments, \r\nwith the sole intention of creating confusion, wasting \r\ntime and wearing out the Assembly. It is an unethical \r\nploy. If the United States Government wanted to \r\nconsider and put to the vote initiatives related to \r\nhuman rights or to the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nwe would be willing to do that immediately under \r\nthe auspices of any body, at any time and under any \r\nrelevant agenda item. We will continue to encourage \r\ndialogue and cooperation as the only way to foment \r\nprogress in the exercise of human rights, and we will \r\ncontinue to actively and constructively participate in \r\nthe Human Rights Council and its Universal Periodic \r\nReview and maintain our cooperation with every one \r\nof its universal mechanisms.\r\nThe United States Government does not have the \r\nleast moral authority to criticize Cuba or any other \r\ncountry in the area of human rights. We reject the \r\nrepeated manipulation of them for political ends and \r\nthe double standards that go along with it. The United \r\nStates Government is responsible for crimes against \r\nhumanity. It was that country that used a nuclear \r\nweapon on a civilian population. It develops weapons \r\nof mass destruction. It is currently starting a new \r\narms race. It is perfecting nuclear weapons, extremely \r\nlethal conventional weapons and lethal autonomous \r\nweapons, and it is militarizing cyberspace and outer \r\nspace. The United States Government is the one that \r\nhas established military dictatorships and organized \r\nbloody coups d’état.\r\nWith the wars that its Government has waged in \r\nrecent years, it has caused the deaths of millions of \r\npeople, many of whom were innocent civilians, as \r\nwell as waves of refugees and the consequent human \r\nsuffering. Its Government has resorted to extrajudicial \r\nexecutions, kidnapping and torture. It is holding \r\nprisoners indefinitely in legal limbo, without recourse \r\nto legal defence, courts or due process at the naval base \r\nin Guantanamo — territory that it illegally usurped \r\nfrom us.\r\nThe Government of the United States has \r\ncommitted human rights violations against its \r\nown citizens, particularly African-Americans and \r\nHispanics, minorities, refugees and migrants. Within \r\na country of great opulence, 40 million United States \r\ncitizens live in poverty, and 52 million Americans live \r\nin impoverished communities. More than half a million \r\nof its citizens sleep in the street, which the Ambassador \r\ndoes not mention. Some 12 per cent of Americans do \r\nnot have medical insurance, and 1 million low-income \r\npersons will be deprived of it by their Government. \r\nA/73/PV.30 01/11/2018\r\n6/24 18-35542\r\nQuality education is not accessible to the majority of \r\npeople, whom their Government neither represents nor \r\nchampions. Equal opportunities in the United States are \r\na pipe dream. The Government that the United States \r\ndelegation is part of is one comprised of millionaires \r\nwho adopt brutal policies.\r\nFor the same job, women earn 82 per cent of what \r\nmen make, while African-American women earn 64 per \r\ncent, and Hispanic women, 62 per cent. Accusations of \r\nsexual harassment are widespread. The average wealth \r\nof white families is seven times greater than that of \r\nfamilies of African descent. The mortality rate for \r\nAfrican-American children less than one year of age \r\nis double that for white children. African-American \r\nmothers are three to four times more likely to die in \r\nchildbirth than white mothers, and half of them would \r\nsurvive with better medical care, which the State \r\nDepartment never calls for.\r\nThere is a difference in racial patterns in the \r\nUnited States prison population, in the length of \r\nprison sentences, in the use of capital punishment, \r\nwhich is also applied to minors and mentally disabled \r\npersons, and in appalling deaths by the discharge of \r\npolice weapons.\r\nThe United States Government builds walls, \r\nseparates minors, including young children, from \r\ntheir migrant parents and locks them up in cages. \r\nFalse information and the monopolization of digital \r\ncommunication platforms and content creation are \r\nincreasing. The United States Government intervenes \r\nunscrupulously in the electoral processes and internal \r\naffairs of the majority of our States. It is attempting to \r\noverthrow the legitimate Government of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela by force, while waging a brutal \r\ndefamation campaign, threatening military action and \r\ncalling for violence and a coup d’état. It is intervening \r\nin and attempting to destabilize the Republic of \r\nNicaragua. It is interfering in the internal affairs of \r\nthe Plurinational State of Bolivia. The Government \r\nof the United States is seeking to exercise imperial \r\ndomination in our Americas, invoking once again the \r\noutdated, aggressive and dangerous Monroe Doctrine \r\nand resorting to gunboat diplomacy. It has redeployed \r\nits Fourth Fleet and increased the number and capacities \r\nof its military bases in the region.\r\nThe United States is party to only 30 per cent of \r\nmajor human rights instruments and does not recognize \r\nthe rights to life, peace, development, security or food, \r\nnor does it recognize the rights of children. It is hardly \r\nsurprising that it has withdrawn from the Human \r\nRights Council. Corporate special interests have \r\nhijacked the United States political system, which is \r\ncorrupt by definition.\r\nWords and political discourse do matter. They are \r\nimportant. By demonizing and making enemies through \r\npropaganda targeting political opponents, institutions, \r\nsocial groups and nations, they fuel and propagate \r\ndivision, violence, hate crimes and wars. The impunity \r\nenjoyed by the arms lobby is to blame for the increase \r\nin murders, including those involving teenagers. We \r\nhave seen worsening levels of dirty politics, indecency, \r\namorality, lying, the gerrymandering of electoral \r\ndistricts for political ends and voter manipulation. Six \r\nmillion low-income Americans were prevented from \r\nvoting in the previous presidential elections, and they \r\nwill probably be prevented from voting next Tuesday. \r\nIn Florida, 21 per cent of African-American voters \r\nare disenfranchised.\r\nThe quantifiable cumulative damage caused \r\nby the almost six-decade-long blockade amounts to \r\n$933.678 billion, adjusting for the devaluation of the \r\ndollar against the price of gold. In present-day dollars, \r\nthe blockade has caused more than $134.499 billion in \r\nfinancial damages. In the past year alone, it has led to \r\nlosses of approximately $4.321 billion for Cuba. Had \r\nCuba received revenues it was unable to receive from \r\nthe export of goods and services and not incurred costs \r\nassociated with the geographical reorientation of trade, \r\nwhich requires our country to maintain extremely large \r\ninventories, Cuba’s gross domestic product would have \r\nincreased at an approximate average annual rate of \r\n10 per cent, in current-day prices, over the past decade.\r\nFaced with such challenges, Cuba has managed \r\nto make economic progress and provides broad and \r\nsupportive international cooperation — which the United \r\nStates Government is increasingly hindering — despite \r\nthe blockade and forbidden access to multilateral \r\ncredit, while at the same time reaching internationally \r\nrecognized levels of human development and social \r\njustice. The blockade continues to be the main obstacle \r\nto the implementation of both the 2030 national plan \r\nand the Sustainable Development Goals. It undermines \r\nthe exercise of the right of the Cuban people to \r\nself-determination, peace, development, security \r\nand justice.\r\n01/11/2018 A/73/PV.30\r\n18-35542 7/24\r\nThe blockade constitutes a violation of the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand international law. It is an act of aggression and \r\neconomic war in breach of peace and the international \r\norder. It also violates the internationally recognized \r\nrules of trade and freedom of navigation. It violates the \r\nprinciples of the Proclamation of Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean as a Zone of Peace and runs contrary \r\nto the consensus reached by the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and the world. It \r\nengenders the isolation of and discredits the Government \r\nof the United States and calls for the judicious rejection \r\nof the international community.\r\nWe are living in a time of increasing threats to \r\ninternational peace and security, the proliferation \r\nof unconventional wars, gross violations of the \r\nsovereignty of States, policies of domination through \r\nthe use of force, attempts to reimpose the unipolar \r\norder, of breaches of international law, the ominous \r\nand arbitrary breaking of international treaties, and \r\npropagation of unilateral sanctions and trade wars, \r\nessentially caused by the predatory and supremacist \r\nnature of United States imperialism, based as always \r\non the principles of neoliberalism, the philosophy of \r\ndispossession and so-called peace based on force. \r\nAs a result, grave international issues are becoming \r\nmore acute, poverty and inequality are on the rise, \r\nthe irrational and unsustainable production and \r\nconsumption cycles of capitalism are harder felt, \r\nclimate change is accelerating unstoppably, together \r\nwith all of its negative consequences, and the nuclear \r\nthreat is at a dangerously heightened level.\r\nMoreover, the extraterritorial imposition of the \r\nblockade has been ferociously intensified, especially \r\nwith regard to crippling measures affecting the financial \r\ntransactions and banking and credit operations of \r\nCuba at the international level. More than a hundred \r\nbanks have requested the closure of the accounts of our \r\nembassies and representative offices abroad. They have \r\neither withheld funds destined for Cuba or refused to \r\nexecute transfers from and to our country, including \r\nfunds intended for humanitarian purposes, such as \r\nthose intended to deal with the impact of Hurricane \r\nIrma in Cuba, or for Cuban solidarity cooperation \r\nprojects in other nations. The blockade runs contrary to \r\nthe Charter and international law, and its aggressively \r\nextraterritorial implementation harms the sovereignty \r\nof all States.\r\nSince the 1898 military occupation of Cuba by the \r\nUnited States to hinder our independence, which had \r\nalready been won in a prolonged and epic struggle, \r\nour relationship has been marked by the efforts of the \r\nGovernment of the United States to control the fate \r\nof Cuba in the face of the unwavering determination \r\nof the Cuban people to defend our independence and \r\nself-determination. Today, Cuba is a fully independent \r\nnation. Master of its destiny, it develops relations \r\nbased on respect and enjoys bonds of friendship and \r\ncooperation with all the countries of the world. We \r\nhave achieved that through the sacrifices of several \r\ngenerations, and we will defend it at any cost.\r\nIn terms of our relations with the United States, \r\nwe have diplomatic relations and some instances of \r\nofficial dialogue, and we are developing some mutually \r\nadvantageous cooperation in a limited number of \r\nareas. But the defining characteristic of our bilateral \r\nrelationship continues to be the economic, commercial \r\nfinancial blockade that punishes all the people of Cuba \r\nand comes from a place of domination, ideological \r\nintolerance and political revenge. Amid the deep \r\ndifferences that exist between Cuba and the Government \r\nof the United States, we are willing to pursue a peaceful \r\ncoexistence that is based on mutual respect, sovereign \r\nequality and the benefit of both peoples.\r\nThe Cuban people will continue to freely determine \r\nour internal affairs in close unity, just as we are doing \r\nin the public debate on the draft of the new Constitution \r\nand as we will do in the upcoming referendum to \r\nadopt it. There is no space — nor will there be any \r\nspace — for the interference of a foreign Power. I must \r\nmake it known that the escalation of statements, acts \r\nand threats from the United States Government against \r\nCuba has no other aim than to foster a climate of greater \r\nbilateral tension, and that, in this scenario, public \r\nfigures with long histories of conspiracy to provoke \r\nbilateral crises are becoming increasingly visible.\r\nAs President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez stated \r\non 26 September in this Hall,\r\n“Cuba will always remain willing to engage in \r\ndialogue and cooperation based on respect and \r\nequal treatment. We will never make concessions \r\nthat affect our national sovereignty and \r\nindependence. We will not barter our principles or \r\naccept conditions.” (A/73/PV.8, p. 35)\r\nCubans of all generations will adhere with \r\ninvariable loyalty to the example of José Martí and \r\nA/73/PV.30 01/11/2018\r\n8/24 18-35542\r\nproclaim with his same conviction that, the south and \r\nnorth seas would merge and a serpent would hatch from \r\nan eagle’s egg before we would yield in our efforts to \r\nmake the homeland free and prosperous.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the debate on this item. The Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda item 43.\r\nThe General Assembly shall now resume its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 43 to take action on the \r\ndraft resolution issued as document A/73/L.3 and the \r\ndraft amendments contained in documents A/73/L.9 to \r\nL.16.\r\nI now give the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba, to introduce draft resolution A/73/L.3.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe deeply thank all those who have expressed their \r\nrejection of the blockade imposed against our country. \r\nTo the citizens of all nations, and to the growing \r\nmajority of Americans who have joined us in this \r\ncause for peace, justice, goodwill and human dignity, \r\nand in the name of the heroic, self less and supportive \r\nCuban people, I ask those present to vote in favour of \r\nthe draft resolution contained in document A/73/L.3, \r\non the necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States \r\nof America against Cuba. The process of adopting the \r\ndraft resolution has begun, and I understand that any \r\nintervention with regard to the substance would be in \r\nviolation of the rules. Madam President, I hope that you \r\nwill enforce those rules.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give \r\nthe f loor to the representative of the United States \r\nto introduce the draft amendments contained in \r\ndocuments A/73/L.9 to A/73/L.16.\r\nMrs. Haley (United States of America): This is \r\nthe twenty-seventh year that the General Assembly has \r\nheld this vote. Every year, with the exception of one, the \r\nUnited States has voted against this draft resolution. \r\nAs this draft resolution is currently constructed, the \r\nUnited States will oppose it again today.\r\nCuba and its allies do the same thing every year. \r\nThey propose a draft resolution blaming Cuba’s \r\npoverty, repression and lack of freedom on the United \r\nStates. They falsely blame America for all kinds of evil \r\nthings, even genocide. But this draft resolution changes \r\nnothing. It does not help a single Cuban family. It does \r\nnot feed a single Cuban child. It does not free a single \r\nCuban political prisoner. Those who support this draft \r\nresolution every year have it wrong. Our reason for \r\nthe embargo is and always has been Cuba’s denial of \r\nfreedom and the most basic human rights to the Cuban \r\npeople. The United States will continue to stand with \r\nthe Cuban people until their rights and freedoms are \r\nrestored. Period. We will not back down.\r\nLast year, we were joined by just one nation in \r\nvoting against resolution 72/4, and that is fine; we \r\nwere in very good company. We have no problem with \r\nstanding alone on behalf of the things that we believe \r\nin and will proudly do so again today if necessary. But \r\nthe most regrettable fact of this draft resolution each \r\nyear is not that the United States may not stand alone \r\nin opposing it, but that the draft resolution is a waste \r\nof everyone’s time. It is one more time that countries \r\nfeel they can poke the United States in the eye. But \r\nthey are not hurting the United States when they do \r\nthis; they are literally hurting the Cuban people by \r\ntelling the regime that their treatment of their people \r\nis acceptable.\r\nFor 27 years we have had this debate, and nothing \r\nhas changed in Cuba — at least nothing for the better. \r\nSupporters of draft resolution A/73/L.3 claim that \r\na change in the policy of the United States would \r\nsomehow transform life for the Cuban people. But the \r\nGovernment of Cuba does not agree. It responded to the \r\nsoftening of our Cuba policy under President Obama \r\nwith more, not less, political repression of its people. \r\nThe sorry state of liberty and human rights in Cuba is \r\nnot lost on anyone in this Hall, even as countries vote to \r\nblindly support the same resolution every year.\r\nThe proof is in the statements delivered by countries \r\nduring this annual debate. Many of us care deeply \r\nabout the lack of freedom of expression and assembly \r\nin Cuba, the arbitrary arrests and detentions, and the \r\nstatus of women and labour. We have listened carefully \r\nto our fellow countries’ statements in this debate, \r\nstudied their comments from last year, and taken their \r\nmessages to heart. We read last year’s statement by the \r\nEuropean Union and we agree with it wholeheartedly. \r\nThe European Union called on Cuba to\r\n“fully grant its citizens internationally recognized \r\ncivil, political, and economic rights and freedoms, \r\nincluding freedom of assembly, freedom of \r\n01/11/2018 A/73/PV.30\r\n18-35542 9/24\r\nexpression, and free access to information” (A/72/\r\nPV.38 p. 27).\r\nYesterday, multiple representatives, speaking \r\nboth for their own countries and for regional groups, \r\nexpressed concern for the realization in Cuba of \r\nthe goals of prosperity, human rights and human \r\ndignity contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (see A/73/PV.29). Last year, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Gabon, speaking for the Group \r\nof African States, expressed the same concern (see \r\nA/72/PV.38). The Ambassador of Singapore, speaking \r\nfor the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, also \r\nexpressed the desire to end poverty and promote human \r\nrights and gender equality in Cuba, in line with the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (ibid.) The Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nspeaking for the Caribbean Community, echoed that \r\nsupport, as did the Ambassador of Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nspeaking for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, \r\nand the Venezuelan ambassador, speaking on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement (ibid.). Furthermore, in \r\ntheir national capacities, the Permanent Representatives \r\nof India, South Africa, Mexico, Indonesia, Chad and \r\nSt. Kitts and Nevis all advocated Cuba’s achievement \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals (see A/72/PV.38 \r\nand A/72/PV.39).\r\nWe have studied Member States’ expressions of \r\nsupport for freedom and human rights in other countries \r\nwhere, like Cuba, they are denied. For example, there \r\nare striking parallels between the suffering of the Cuban \r\npeople under the Castro dictatorship and its successors \r\nand the suffering of the Iranian people under the \r\ndictatorship of the mullahs in Tehran. Like the Castro \r\nregime, the Iranian regime violently represses dissent, \r\nimprisons and kills its political opponents, and abuses \r\nwomen, and religious and ethnic minorities. Like the \r\nCastro dictatorship, the Tehran Government has rigged \r\nits economy in favour of its regime and its cronies. And \r\nboth Governments use these stolen funds to finance \r\ntheir aggression abroad.\r\nEach year, the General Assembly adopts a draft \r\nresolution condemning the Iranian regime’s violations \r\nof human rights. Last year, resolution 72/189 was \r\nadopted with the support of 81 Member States. Eighty-\r\none countries made the decision to use the Assembly’s \r\ntime and prestige to do what the United Nations does \r\nbest — what it is meant to do. Eighty-one countries put \r\nthe weight of the international community behind the \r\nprinciples of peace, security and human rights in Iran.\r\nThey did not just pay lip service to those principles; \r\nthey put them in a draft resolution, which they then put \r\nto a vote. They won. But most importantly, the cause \r\nof human rights in Iran won. The time has long passed \r\nfor the General Assembly to do the same for Cuba and \r\nfor the same reasons. How can delegations feel strongly \r\nabout Iran and not about Cuba? Countries that are \r\nconcerned about the arrest of political opponents and \r\njournalists, the lack of access to the Internet, and the \r\nabsolute authority of the Government to restrict travel \r\nboth within and from Cuba should have the opportunity \r\nto vote to put themselves and the Assembly on record.\r\nThe United Nations does not have the ability or the \r\nauthority to end the United States embargo of Cuba. \r\nBut the United Nations has the unique ability to send a \r\nmoral message to the Cuban dictatorship. We should use \r\nour megaphone to do something that has the potential \r\nto actually improve the lives of the Cuban people. The \r\nUnited States has proposed a series of amendments \r\nto draft resolution А/73/L.3. These amendments have \r\nbeen taken directly from the Member States. They are \r\ntheir expressions of hope for human rights in Cuba. \r\nThe content has been supplied by the Member States; \r\nthe words of these draft resolutions are their words.\r\nThis year, delegations will be asked to vote not just \r\non the American embargo, but also on Cuba’s political \r\nprisoners, the country’s lack of freedom of expression, \r\nand its oppression of workers. This year, delegations \r\nhave the opportunity to do something that will send an \r\nunmistakable message to the people of Cuba that the \r\nworld is not ignoring their suffering.\r\nFor decades, the General Assembly has failed to \r\ndemonstrate leadership in advocating a better life for \r\nthe Cuban people. Today, it can show leadership. I call \r\non the Assembly to vote to affirm the human rights \r\nand freedoms of the Cuban people that it extends to so \r\nmany other countries. I call on Member States to vote \r\nin favour on each and every amendment proposed by \r\nthe United States. We call on the General Assembly \r\ntoday to show the world that it stands for human rights \r\nand human dignity.\r\nTo the people of Cuba, I once again say that \r\nthe United States will continue to stand with them, \r\nregardless of what others do. We will stand with them \r\nuntil the day comes that we can stand together as free \r\npeoples in our shared neighbourhood.\r\nA/73/PV.30 01/11/2018\r\n10/24 18-35542\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We shall now \r\nproceed to consider draft resolution A/73/L.3 and draft \r\namendments A/73/L.9 to A/73/L.16.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in explanation \r\nof vote before the voting, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote should be limited to 10 minutes \r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats. \r\nI would ask delegations that take the f loor to explain \r\ntheir vote to do so only once, that is, either before or \r\nafter the consideration of all draft documents presented \r\nfor a vote.\r\nMr. Charwath (Austria): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union (EU) and its member \r\nStates. The candidate countries the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania; the \r\ncountry of the Stabilization and Association process \r\nand potential candidate Bosnia and Herzegovina; \r\nand the European Free Trade Association country \r\nLiechtenstein, member of the European Economic \r\nArea, align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States on Cuba has a damaging \r\nimpact on the economic situation of the country and \r\nnegatively affects the living standards of the Cuban \r\npeople. External trade and foreign investment will play \r\na crucial role in setting the country on a path towards \r\nsustainable growth. The EU therefore considers that \r\nlifting the embargo could facilitate the opening of the \r\nCuban economy for the benefit of the Cuban people.\r\nThe EU believes that positive change in Cuba \r\nis best brought about by closer engagement at all \r\nlevels — Government, economy and civil society — but \r\nalso through people-to-people exchanges. We therefore \r\ndeeply regret the reintroduction of restrictions on United \r\nStates relations with Cuba by the current United States \r\nAdministration. The measures restricting individual \r\nself-directed travel in particular not only curtail the \r\npossibility for engagement with the Cuban people, but \r\nalso are hitting Cuba’s burgeoning private sector, which \r\nhas benefited the most from such individual visits.\r\nBeyond the damaging impact of the embargo on \r\nordinary Cubans, unilateral United States sanctions \r\nand other unilateral administrative and judicial \r\nmeasures are also negatively affecting EU economic \r\ninterests. We have firmly and continuously opposed \r\nany such measures, owing to their extraterritorial \r\nimpact on the European Union, in violation of \r\ncommonly accepted rules of international trade. We \r\ncannot accept that unilaterally imposed measures \r\nimpede our economic and commercial relations with \r\nCuba. The EU Council of Ministers therefore adopted \r\na regulation and a joint action to protect against undue \r\ninterference and problems for EU citizens, businesses \r\nand non-governmental organizations residing, working \r\nor operating in Cuba.\r\nIt is crucial that the United States continue to fully \r\nrespect and implement the agreement reached at the \r\nsummit between the European Union and the United \r\nStates held in London in May 1998. This agreement \r\ncovers waivers to Titles III and IV of the Helms-Burton \r\nAct, a commitment by the United States Government \r\nto resist future extraterritorial legislation of that kind, \r\nand an understanding regarding disciplines for the \r\nstrengthening of investment protection.\r\nFor the EU, opening doors and closer engagement \r\nare the way to go with Cuba. The date of 1 November \r\n2018 marks the first anniversary of the provisional \r\napplication of the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and \r\nCooperation Agreement (PDCA). The agreement has put \r\nour bilateral relationship on a new and solid legal footing \r\nand sets out an agenda of critical engagement with Cuba \r\nthat will also allow us to support and accompany Cuba \r\non its path of reform and modernization. We are also \r\nenhancing dialogue and cooperation on issues on which \r\nwe still have fundamental differences. To this end, the \r\nPDCA has established a human rights dialogue as a \r\nkey pillar of our relationship. The first formal meeting \r\nof the Dialogue, which was held in a constructive and \r\nopen atmosphere, took place last month.\r\nWe reiterate our call on the Cuban Government \r\nto fully grant its citizens internationally recognized \r\ncivil, political and economic rights and freedoms, \r\nincluding the freedom of assembly, the freedom of \r\nexpression and free access to information, to ratify the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \r\nand the International Covenant on Economic, Social \r\nand Cultural Rights, and to extend invitations to United \r\nNations special rapporteurs to visit Cuba.\r\nWe take due note of the amendments proposed by \r\nthe United States. Such concerns were indeed brought \r\nup by several EU member States at the recent Universal \r\nPeriodic Review of Cuba at the Human Rights Council. \r\nHowever, the EU considers that they have no place \r\nin the present draft resolution, which addresses a \r\ndifferent, largely economic topic. In a particularly \r\nsensitive context, separate subjects should not be \r\n01/11/2018 A/73/PV.30\r\n18-35542 11/24\r\nmixed. Any amendments not directly related to the \r\nsubject matter should be avoided, as they risk unduly \r\nconfusing the issue.\r\nFollowing the generational leadership change that \r\ntook place in Cuba last April and in the context of the \r\nongoing constitutional reform process, we call on Cuba \r\nto pursue a comprehensive reform and modernization \r\nagenda, extend economic and social reforms, and \r\nimplement such reforms in a manner that will address \r\nthe key concerns of the Cuban population and the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of the Cuban people for greater \r\nopportunities to participate in the shaping of their \r\ncountry’s future.\r\nWith the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and \r\nCooperation Agreement, the EU offers Cuba a \r\nconsistent and reliable partnership to support it as it \r\nseeks to reform its political and economic model, pursue \r\nsustainable development and find common solutions \r\nto global challenges, while we continue to vigorously \r\npromote democracy and respect for human rights. It \r\nis our considered view that the United States embargo \r\ndoes not contribute to promoting these aims, but \r\nimpedes their achievement. Against this background, \r\nthe States members of the European Union will vote \r\nunanimously in favour of draft resolution A/73/L.3.\r\nMr. Blanchard (Canada): As it has always done, \r\nCanada will vote in favour of the draft resolution on \r\nthe necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial blockade imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba (A/73/L.3).\r\nWith respect to the proposed United States \r\namendments to draft resolution A/73/L.3, Canada will \r\nvote against them.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada wishes to clarify that by voting against these \r\namendments, it is not voting on the substance of the \r\namendments themselves. The reason Canada is voting \r\nagainst these amendments proposed by the United \r\nStates is that this draft resolution is not the appropriate \r\nframework in which to consider Cuba’s compliance \r\nwith its international human rights obligations.\r\nMr. Kapambwe (Zambia): Not long ago, in the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall and from this very rostrum, the \r\nwhole world paused as leader after leader praised one \r\nof the greatest human beings that ever lived, Nelson \r\nMandela. We extolled his virtues, his principles and the \r\npeace and reconciliation that he preached and lived by. \r\nAt the end of the day, we all committed ourselves to \r\na decade of peace. It was a beautiful moment and, to \r\nborrow the words of the former President of the United \r\nStates, Barack Obama, “a teachable moment”.\r\nMandela’s life, his philosophy and what he stood for \r\ncan be summed up in one word, ubuntu, which means \r\nhumanness or conscience. Humanness is not found in \r\nthe big declarations we make or the grand projects and \r\nprogrammes that we craft as philanthropic gestures. \r\nRather, it is in the simple, small, mundane, day-to-day \r\nthings we do to each other, for each other, with each \r\nother and against each other that our humanness, our \r\nubuntu, is defined.\r\nAs we consider the draft resolution before us on \r\nthe necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba (A/73/L.3), let us ask ourselves \r\nin good conscience, are we living up to the test and the \r\nstandard of ubuntu, of humanness, that we all extolled \r\nMandela for living up to?\r\nMy country, Zambia, has many differences with \r\nhow Cuba is run day by day, as well as with how the \r\nUnited States of America is run day by day. Indeed, \r\nwe have many differences with how every country in \r\nthe world is run day by day. However, what we know \r\nand are prepared to defend without equivocation is \r\nthat these differences in perspective on life and on \r\ngovernance are the right of the people of each country \r\nto decide for themselves, in accordance with their \r\nhistory, their culture and their circumstances. What is \r\nnot in contention, and should never be in contention \r\nis that the thread of life, the thread of humanness that \r\nruns in every Cuban, is the same thread that runs in \r\nevery one of us and in every American.\r\nI learned recently how the American law-\r\nenforcement community resented the use of the phrase \r\n“mass incarceration” to describe the phenomenon of \r\nthe high incidence of a sector of the population being \r\nimprisoned compared to other sectors. They said that \r\nevery person arrested was arrested as an individual \r\nand tried as an individual for each crime committed \r\nand on the specific evidence relating to each crime \r\nfor which each individual was charged. Just as the \r\nUnited States law enforcement community rejects that \r\ngroup characterization, so too should the United States \r\nGovernment not continue with the group punishment \r\nof the people of Cuba, with the embargo imposed \r\non ordinary people who have committed no crime \r\nA/73/PV.30 01/11/2018\r\n12/24 18-35542\r\nwhatsoever against the Government or the people of \r\nthe United States.\r\nWhen we stand at this rostrum and say what we \r\nare saying, we are not doing so as a lynch mob baying \r\nfor the blood of the United States. We have a saying \r\nin my country: one who tells someone how ugly they \r\nare is a good friend. The United States is a good \r\nfriend. We say these things to appeal to its sense of \r\nubuntu — humanness — in the treatment of the \r\npeople of Cuba. We say these things to appeal to the \r\nUnited States to live up to the high standards that it \r\nhas set for itself — the standard of democracy that \r\ncompels all of us, if we choose to practice democracy, \r\nto accept the decision of the majority. For, time after \r\ntime, the overwhelming majority of the world — the \r\nMembers of the United Nations — has voted in favour \r\nof this resolution calling on the United States to lift \r\nthe embargo.\r\nThe United States is a big, powerful country — a \r\ngreat country. As stated in the Bible, to whom much \r\nis given, much is expected. Greatness lies not in the \r\nability to subdue, but in the ability to uplift and inspire. \r\nGreatness lies not in the ability to destroy, but in the \r\nability to repair and build. Greatness lies not in the \r\nability to benefit from power, but in the ability to use \r\npower to protect the small and the weak and to enable \r\nthe unable.\r\nI beseech all of us to learn from the palm tree that \r\nwithstands storm after storm. That greatness lies not in \r\nthe ability to stand straight and rigid, but in the ability \r\nto stoop low, to the level of one whom the gales of \r\nwinds have knocked down, and lift them up.\r\nMy delegation will vote in favour of the \r\ndraft resolution.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nThe General Assembly will now take a decision on \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.3, entitled “Necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba”.\r\nIn accordance with rule 90 of the rules of procedure, \r\nthe Assembly will first take a decision on the draft \r\namendments contained in documents A/73/L.9 to \r\nA/73/L.16, one by one.\r\nBefore proceeding to take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.3 and draft amendments A/73/L.9 \r\nto A/73/L.16, I wish to inform members that I have \r\nbeen approached by several delegations concerning \r\nthe majority required for the adoption of the draft \r\nproposals. Having taken note of the statements made \r\nby Member States in the debate, I shall put to the \r\nconsideration of the Assembly the question of whether \r\na two-thirds majority of the members present and \r\nvoting is required for the adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.3 and the amendments contained in documents \r\nA/73/L.9 to A/73/L.16, in accordance with rules 83 and \r\n84 of the rules of procedure.\r\nI shall first give the f loor to delegations that wish to \r\ntake the f loor in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba): Before adopting \r\nany decision, it should be crystal clear to all Member \r\nStates that proposals presented under item 43 of the \r\nagenda of the seventy-third session of the General \r\nAssembly, on the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed against \r\nCuba, are important questions by virtue of rule 83 of \r\nthe General Assembly’s rules of procedure.\r\nIn assigning the agenda items of the seventy-\r\nthird session of the General Assembly, as indicated \r\nin document A/73/252, the Assembly defined item \r\n43 — as it has done for more than a decade — under \r\nthe heading of “Maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity”. Rule 84 of the General Assembly’s rules of \r\nprocedure, establishes that\r\n“Decisions of the General Assembly on \r\namendments to proposals relating to important \r\nquestions, and on parts of such proposals put to \r\nthe vote separately, shall be made by a two-thirds \r\nmajority of the members present and voting.”\r\nTherefore, in order to be adopted, draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.3 and the draft amendments contained in \r\ndocuments A/73/L.9, A/73/L.10, A/73/L.11, A/73/L.12, \r\nA/73/L.13, A/73/L.14, A/73/L.15 and A/73/L.16 require \r\nthe support of a two-thirds majority of the members \r\npresent and voting.\r\nAs the Assembly has seen, I am requesting, in \r\naccordance with the rules of procedure of the General \r\nAssembly, that item 43 be considered an important \r\nquestion and that all of those decisions, including on \r\nthe draft amendments, be adopted only by a two-thirds \r\nmajority. Cuba would appreciate that countries vote \r\nin favour of the motion by voting yes to this proposal \r\nmade by Cuba.\r\n01/11/2018 A/73/PV.30\r\n18-35542 13/24\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): At this point, I \r\nwould like to clarify that, in accordance with Article \r\n18, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nthis question will be settled by a simple majority of the \r\nmembers present and voting.\r\nMrs. Haley (United States of America): A simple \r\nmajority is required for the adoption of the United \r\nStates-proposed draft amendments. Cuba’s draft \r\nresolution and our amendments do not rise to the \r\nstandard required for a two-thirds majority. They are \r\nsolely about economic, human rights and social issues. \r\nI would refer the membership to a decision made by the \r\nAssembly on 22 June, in which the Assembly decided \r\nthat a resolution on the Republic of Moldova (resolution \r\n72/282) would be subject to a simple majority of the \r\nmembers present and voting. If that resolution, on \r\nRussia’s military forces in Moldova, was subject to \r\na simple majority, then surely this one, on economic, \r\nhuman rights and social issues, with its related draft \r\namendments, is also subject to a simple majority.\r\nI urge all Member States to vote against a decision \r\nthat a two-thirds majority is required.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nWe will now proceed to take a decision on the \r\nquestion of whether a two-thirds majority of the \r\nmembers present and voting is required for the adoption \r\nof draft resolution A/73/L.3 its draft amendments.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Belarus, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, \r\nBolivia (Plurinational State of), Botswana, Brunei \r\nDarussalam, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, \r\nCambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, \r\nChad, China, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Cuba, \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, \r\nDominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, \r\nEquatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, \r\nGabon, Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, \r\nGuinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, \r\nIndia, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, \r\nJamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, \r\nKuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic, Lebanon, Lesotho, Libya, Madagascar, \r\nMalawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, \r\nMauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, Mozambique, \r\nMyanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Nepal, Nicaragua, \r\nNiger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, \r\nPapua New Guinea, Paraguay, Philippines, Qatar, \r\nRussian Federation, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, \r\nSaint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nSao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, \r\nSeychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon \r\nIslands, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sri \r\nLanka, Sudan, Suriname, Syrian Arab Republic, \r\nTajikistan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Trinidad \r\nand Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, \r\nUganda, United Arab Emirates, United Republic \r\nof Tanzania, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Venezuela \r\n(Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, Yemen, \r\nZambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nAustralia, Barbados, Canada, Georgia, Israel, \r\nPeru, Republic of Moldova, Ukraine, United States \r\nof America\r\nAbstaining:\r\nAlbania, Andorra, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, \r\nBelgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, \r\nBulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, \r\nCyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Fiji, \r\nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, \r\nIceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liberia, \r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, \r\nMonaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, \r\nNorway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, \r\nRomania, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, \r\nSweden, Switzerland, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Tuvalu, United Kingdom \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Uruguay\r\nBy 126 votes to 9, with 52 abstentions, the General \r\nAssembly decided that a two-thirds majority of \r\nthe members present and voting was required for \r\nthe adoption of draft resolution A/73/L.3 and its \r\ndraft amendments.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nhas decided that a two-thirds majority of the members \r\npresent and voting is required for the adoption of draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.3.

whole, was adopted \r\nby 189 votes to 2 (resolution 73/8).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Before giving \r\nthe f loor to speakers in explanation of vote after the \r\nvoting, may I remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMrs. Haley (United States of America): I am \r\nalways taken aback when I hear applause in the \r\nChamber at moments like this because there are no \r\nwinners here today; there are only losers. The United \r\nNations has lost. It has rejected the opportunity to \r\nspeak on behalf of human rights. The Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations commits every country here to the \r\npromotion of peace, security and human rights, and \r\nthat Charter was betrayed today. Once again, we were \r\nreminded why so many people believe that faith in the \r\nUnited Nations is often misplaced. The countries that \r\nprofess to believe in human rights have lost, too. They \r\nhave earned a justified measure of doubt that they will \r\nact to defend their beliefs. And, most of all, the Cuban \r\npeople have lost. They have been left once again to the \r\nbrutal whims of the Castro dictatorship. They have \r\nbeen abandoned by the United Nations and by most of \r\nthe world’s Governments.\r\nBut the Cuban people are not alone today. The \r\nUnited States of America stands with them. The people \r\nof Cuba are our neighbours and our friends, and they \r\nare fellow children of God. The American people will \r\nstand with them until they are restored the rights that \r\nGod has given us all, rights that no Government can \r\nlegitimately deny its people.\r\nA/73/PV.30 01/11/2018\r\n20/24 18-35542\r\nWhile today’s votes were not admirable, they were \r\nhighly illuminating. That light contributes to the cause \r\nof truth, which is the essential basis of freedom and \r\nhuman rights.\r\nMr. Bermúdez Álvarez (Uruguay) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, I should like thank the \r\nPermanent Representative of the United States for \r\npresenting the draft amendments that were submitted \r\nduring today’s meeting. Uruguay chose to abstain in \r\nthe voting on the draft amendments that were proposed. \r\nMy delegation will not speak on the content of the \r\nparagraphs submitted to a vote, but rather on their \r\nappropriateness and objective.\r\nUruguay is a firm defender of human rights and \r\nhas always worked actively to promote them. Uruguay \r\nhas also been a part of collective efforts to ensure \r\ntheir incorporation into the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals as well as their actual implementation. We will \r\ncontinue to do so in all of the appropriate forums where \r\nthese topics are taken up. We understand that it would \r\nnot be appropriate in this specific case to incorporate \r\nthe draft amendments that refer to these matters in a \r\nresolution whose text has been supported practically \r\nunanimously by the entire membership for more than a \r\nquarter of a century.\r\nFirst of all, the matters referred to in the draft \r\namendments were not issues that were part of \r\nresolution 73/8. The topic of the resolution that we are \r\ndealing with is specific and targeted: it refers to the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nSecondly, including those changes would have \r\ndistorted the essence of the resolution. The changes \r\nwould dilute the main and specific objective, which is \r\nto put an end to the unilateral coercive measures that \r\nhave been applied for more than 50 years against that \r\nCaribbean country. The draft amendments would have \r\ndiverted the focus of the resolution on the lifting of \r\nthe blockade. Because they dealt with issues that were \r\nrelated to human rights, Uruguay could not vote against \r\nthem. That is the reason we abstained.\r\nThe blockade cannot be justified in any way. \r\nThis resolution must continue to be brief, clear and \r\nblunt, expressing very clearly and firmly that the \r\nembargo is unacceptable and illegitimate because \r\nit violates international law and goes against the \r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWith respect to the resolution to put an end to \r\nthe embargo, first of all we would like to welcome \r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, and thank him for the detailed \r\nintroduction of the resolution.\r\nAs Uruguay has always done, my country voted \r\nonce again in favour of the resolution put forward by \r\nthe Cuban delegation, in the understanding that that \r\nthe unilateral economic, financial and commercial \r\nembargo against the country goes against international \r\nlaw and violates the purposes and principles enshrined \r\nin the Charter. The position of Uruguay is a part of a \r\ncontext of respect for the sovereign equality of States, \r\nnon-intervention, as well as the peaceful dispute \r\nsettlement, principles that lie at the core of my country’s \r\nforeign policy. As a matter of principle, Uruguay \r\nrejects and does not acknowledge the extraterritorial \r\napplication of the domestic laws of other States, or \r\nof any other direct or indirect mechanism that would \r\nconstitute a unilateral action by any State, and whose \r\nobjective would be to sanction the decisions adopted \r\nin political, economic, commercial, social and cultural \r\nmatters, or other matters of another sovereign State. \r\nIn that respect my country does not support the \r\nimplementation of the course of unilateral measures \r\napplied by the United States against Cuba.\r\nUruguay also believes that the unilateral sanctions \r\nand extraterritorial laws imposed against Cuba \r\nlead to very serious consequences for the economic \r\ndevelopment of the country and undermine the well-\r\nbeing of its population, as they impede their legitimate \r\nright to development and cause material damage \r\nagainst the dignity and sovereignty of the Cuban \r\npeople. By voting in favour of the resolution, Uruguay \r\nreiterates its commitment to multilateralism, which \r\nwe see as a legitimate means of resolving disputes \r\nbetween States and as an effective tool to promote \r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nThe process of rapprochement between Cuba \r\nand the United States and the measures of mutual \r\ndétente that were adopted some time ago with a view \r\nto improving the bilateral climate were a historic \r\nstep. They constituted unprecedented progress and \r\ndemonstrated that understanding is possible. Uruguay \r\nregrets the current chill in relations between the two \r\ncountries, and we kindly urge a return to the path of a \r\nbilateral dialogue, which would lead to the benefits of \r\npeace, understanding and stability in our region.\r\n01/11/2018 A/73/PV.30\r\n18-35542 21/24\r\nMs. Krisnamurthi (Indonesia): I would like to \r\nbegin by thanking the Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba for his expression of condolences and sympathies \r\nwith respect to the recent aviation incident in Indonesia.\r\nThe General Assembly has consistently opposed \r\nthe imposition of unilateral economic measures as \r\nan instrument of political and economic coercion. \r\nTherefore, it is regrettable that the General Assembly \r\nhas to meet once again to consider and vote on lifting \r\nthe embargo.\r\nIndonesia reaffirms its fundamental belief that \r\nunilateral economic measures as a means of political \r\nand economic coercion against country and, in this \r\nregard, the continued imposition of an economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba, \r\ncontradict the main principles of international law, \r\nincluding the Charter of the United Nations, the norms \r\nand principles governing peaceful relations among \r\nStates, the principle of the sovereign equality of States, \r\nthe principle of non-intervention and non-interference \r\nin each other’s domestic affairs, as well as international \r\nhumanitarian law. Indonesia therefore joined the \r\nmajority of the States Members of the United Nations \r\nby voting in favour of resolution 73/8, as proposed \r\nby Cuba.\r\nIndonesia is concerned about the prolonged \r\nnegative impacts of the blockade on economic and \r\nsocial development in Cuba. The blockade remains \r\nan obstacle to the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development for the Cuban people. We \r\nsupport efforts to ensure that the Government and the \r\npeople of Cuba can achieve sustainable development \r\nand be an integral part of the global economic, trade \r\nand financial system. Towards that goal, we call \r\nfor dialogue and cooperation and the removal of the \r\nembargo on Cuba.\r\nMs. Yánez Loza (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nIn making this explanation of vote I wish to refer to \r\nthe statement made by the President of the Republic \r\nof Ecuador, Mr. Lenin Moreno Garcés, in the general \r\ndebate on 25 September. In that statement, he cited a \r\npassage from the Declaration of Independence of the \r\nUnited States on the intrinsic equality of all, in the \r\nsense that\r\n“all men are created equal, that they are endowed \r\nby their creator with certain unalienable rights, \r\nthat among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of \r\nhappiness” (A/73/PV.6, p.13).\r\nIn that regard, it is incomprehensible that a country, \r\nthe Constitution of which is based on those principles \r\nand concepts — values that are the foundation of the \r\ninternational human rights regime — should maintain \r\nin force the provisions of the economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade against Cuba. Ecuador therefore \r\nonce again reiterates its concern that this issue has \r\nremained under consideration by the General Assembly \r\nfor more than a quarter of a century, without a clear \r\nsignal regarding the total repeal of the provisions of \r\nthe blockade.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General (A/73/85), \r\nwhich compiles the responses of Governments, organs \r\nand agencies of the United Nations system and entities \r\nparticipating as observers in the General Assembly, \r\nhighlights the adverse socioeconomic effects on \r\nCuba of the implementation of the measures, as well \r\nas the almost unanimous support of the international \r\ncommunity for ending the embargo.\r\nThe embargo continues to undermine the \r\ncommon desire for harmonious coexistence among \r\ncountries, particularly now as collective efforts seek \r\nto consolidate and accelerate processes towards the \r\nfull implementation of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and its goals.\r\nMy country, in accordance with the principles of \r\ninternational law, in line with the Charter of the United \r\nNations and regardless of political or ideological \r\norientations, has consistently voted in favour of this \r\nresolution submitted by Cuba.\r\nMs. Bird (Australia): Australia agrees with the \r\nUnited States that Cuba has human rights issues to \r\naddress. Australia recently put its concerns on record \r\nthrough the statement it delivered at the 2018 Human \r\nRights Council Universal Periodic Review of Cuba.\r\nWe do not, however, believe that using resolution \r\n73/8, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by \r\nthe United States of America against Cuba”, is the \r\nappropriate way to raise those human rights concerns. \r\nAustralia therefore abstained in the voting on the draft \r\namendments and, consistent with our long-standing \r\nposition, voted in favour of the resolution.\r\nMr. Carazo (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): Costa \r\nRica reaffirms its absolute commitment to the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nConsistent with its policy of peace, commitment to \r\nA/73/PV.30 01/11/2018\r\n22/24 18-35542\r\nmultilateralism and strict respect for international law, \r\nmy country reiterated its historic support for Cuba by \r\nvoting in favour of resolution 73/8 today. Costa Rica \r\nhas remained consistent in its position, both at the \r\nregional and international levels, on the need to lift the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade imposed \r\non Cuba, which directly affects the Cuban people.\r\nWith respect to the draft amendments that were \r\npresented to the draft resolution, which were voted \r\non prior to the resolution, Costa Rica felt that those \r\nproposals would alter the scope of the resolution and \r\ndistort it, which is why we abstained in the voting in \r\norder to maintain the integrity and ultimate purpose of \r\nthe resolution.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating our conviction \r\nthat it is only through a frank, open and transparent \r\ndialogue, within the framework of international law, \r\ncan differences between countries be addressed and \r\nresolved. In voting against the economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade imposed on Cuba, Costa Rica \r\nhas reaffirmed its complete rejection of unilateral \r\nmeasures that any State would take against another.\r\nMr. Verdier (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nFirst of all, I would like to welcome the presence of \r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, and thank him for his very detailed \r\nintroduction of resolution 73/8.\r\nArgentina fully associates itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of Egypt, on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, and El Salvador, on behalf \r\nof the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, and wishes to make the following remarks in its \r\nnational capacity.\r\nArgentina’s historic position is that the United \r\nStates economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba, which is contrary to international law, \r\nin particular the principles of sovereign equality of \r\nStates, non-intervention in internal affairs, freedom \r\nof international trade and navigation and peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, must be ended. As part of its \r\nfull commitment to the Charter of the United Nations, \r\ninternational law and multilateralism, Argentina \r\nopposes the use of unilateral coercive measures, the \r\nextraterritorial application of national laws and the \r\nadoption of discriminatory commercial practices. \r\nConsequently, Argentina has traditionally supported \r\nthe resolutions against the blockade and has spoken \r\nout on every occasion that the issue has arisen, both in \r\nregional forums and other international organizations.\r\nWe regret that the laws underpinning the blockade \r\ncontinue to be in force and that their application \r\ncontinues to constitute an obstacle to the full \r\ndevelopment of the Cuban people. The adoption of this \r\nnew resolution 73/8 by a large majority reiterates the \r\nunequivocal message of the international community. \r\nArgentina reaffirms its conviction that dialogue \r\nwithout preconditions between the two parties, which \r\nimplies the mutual recognition of both Governments as \r\nlegitimate and equal interlocutors, will make it possible \r\nto resolve all outstanding issues between the United \r\nStates and Cuba, including the lifting of the blockade.\r\nMr. Arrocha Ruíz (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me to begin by welcoming Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla and by thanking the \r\nSecretary-General for presenting his report (A/73/85), \r\npublished on 29 August.\r\nPanama once again voted in favour of the resolution \r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”, thereby renewing our historic \r\nsupport for the lifting of restrictive measures that \r\nnegatively impact Cuba’s full economic and social \r\ndevelopment. As a country that promotes dialogue \r\nbased on common respect, the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes, as well as free trade and the transparent \r\npractice of international trade, we encourage friendly \r\nand cooperative relations among States, based on \r\ninternational law, sovereign equality, non-interference \r\nand non-intervention and the self-determination of \r\npeoples as fundamental principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMy Government has followed with attention and \r\nhas expressed its full support for the economic opening \r\nand modernization of Cuba, as they presage the positive \r\nimpact and opportunities they are generating for the \r\nbenefit of its population. We have therefore adopted \r\nmeasures that strengthen the economic, commercial \r\nand tourism exchange between our countries. More \r\nrecently, we have promoted significant business \r\nengagement, which was supported by the participation \r\nof President Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez in the Havana \r\nInternational Fair, as a sign of Panama’s determined \r\nsupport to strengthen relations between our countries.\r\nBearing in mind the global objective that we have \r\nset with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n01/11/2018 A/73/PV.30\r\n18-35542 23/24\r\nand the purpose of leaving no one behind, my country \r\nand 12 million Cubans hope that dialogue without \r\npreconditions, in full compliance with our obligations \r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations, including the \r\napplication of the principle of non-intervention in the \r\ninternal affairs of another State, is the key to achieving \r\nwell-being and social justice.\r\nAs a result of Panama witnessing, on its own soil, \r\nthe historic 2015 rapprochement between Cuba and the \r\nUnited States — both countries friends of the people \r\nand the Government of Panama — which led to a new \r\nstage in the normalization of their relations, my country \r\nfirmly believes that only the re-establishment of a \r\nbilateral dialogue between the two Governments can \r\ncontribute to reaching understanding and achieving \r\ncordial relations, which the international community \r\nhas been promoting for decades.\r\nI conclude by expressing Panama’s support for \r\nresolution 73/8, which was introduced and adopted \r\ntoday, in favour of Cuba. I reaffirm the steadfast \r\nand determined support of my country to contribute \r\nconstructively to overcoming the impasse that distances \r\ntwo brotherly countries from our region.\r\nMr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 73/8 and against the draft \r\namendments to the text because we felt that it was \r\nimportant to maintain the integrity of the resolution \r\nthat was introduced by the Cuban delegation, which \r\nis identical in scope to the resolution that the General \r\nAssembly has consistently adopted since 1992 and in \r\nwhich we call for an end to the economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba — a blockade that Peru opposes. \r\nHowever, want to be clear that we did so without \r\nprejudice to our traditional and unconditional respect \r\nfor and promotion of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms, as stated in the Constitution of Peru, in \r\naddition to being a priority of our foreign policy.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in explanation of vote after the voting.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to the speaker in the \r\nexercise of the right of reply, I should like to remind \r\nmembers that statements in the exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention \r\nand to five minutes for the second, and should be made \r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): The \r\nstatement made by the representative of the United \r\nStates leaves my delegation with no choice but to \r\nexercise its right of reply. We deeply regret that this \r\nforum has been used as an opportunity to make \r\nreference to my country with fallacies that confirm the \r\npathological tendency of the United States to distort \r\nreality when it comes to States that do not submit to \r\nor follow its contradictory policies. We reject such \r\ndesperate efforts to take advantage of this international \r\nforum and manipulate any issue for political purposes.\r\nThe United States has f lagrantly violated \r\ninternational law, including by its withdrawal from \r\nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — the Iranian \r\nnuclear deal. Moreover, it disregards Security Council \r\nresolution 2231 (2015), which was unanimously \r\nadopted, including by the United States, grossly violates \r\nhuman rights, demonstrates lunatic unilateralism and \r\nexercises a warmongering policy. All of that is of great \r\nconcern and a threat to both regional and international \r\npeace and security. The United States has no moral \r\nauthority to impose its views on my country through its \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade, under \r\nwhich the Government of the United States is violating \r\nthe human rights of more than 80 million Iranians.\r\nThe United States is therefore in no position to \r\nlecture or impose its will on anyone. We have strongly \r\ncondemned the contradictory and interventionist \r\npolicy of that country, in particular its devastating \r\nintervention in the Middle East. It is unfortunate \r\nthat its abuse of the United Nations, in particular the \r\nGeneral Assembly, has become a pathological tendency \r\nand prevailing tradition to advance its political ends.\r\nIt is worth noting that credible United Nation \r\ntreaty bodies have expressed deep concerns in their \r\nconcluding observations about discrimination against \r\nracial, ethnic and national minorities, especially \r\nLatino and African-American persons, in the United \r\nStates. Alongside the overwhelming majority of the \r\ninternational community, which opposed or did not \r\nconsciously support similar moves in the past, we are \r\nfirmly convinced that such an ill-intended practice has \r\nnothing to do with the humanitarian cause or human \r\nrights and will harm the credibility of the United \r\nNations and its relevant mechanisms.\r\nWe expect that the United States officials present \r\nhere will take the opportunity to sincerely apologize \r\nfor their unilateral and arrogant, as well as unlawful, \r\nA/73/PV.30 01/11/2018\r\n24/24 18-35542\r\nacts that violate human rights in Cuba, my country and \r\nother States on which they have imposed sanctions, \r\nwhich they have invaded or in which they have somehow \r\nintervened. American disregard of international law \r\nand norms, as well as its disregard for its commitments, \r\nare arousing indignation and resentment worldwide.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): May I take it \r\nthat it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude \r\nits consideration of agenda item 43?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n"
