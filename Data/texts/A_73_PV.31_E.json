"United Nations A/73/PV.31\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n31st plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 2 November 2018, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Arrocha Ruíz \r\n(Panama), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 69\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council (A/73/53 \r\nand A/73/53/Add.1)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\nconnection with this item, I would recall that the \r\nGeneral Assembly decided, at its 3rd plenary meeting, \r\non 21 September 2018, to consider agenda item 69 in \r\nplenary meeting and in the Third Committee, pursuant \r\nto resolution 65/281, of 17 June 2011.\r\nI shall now make a statement on behalf of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly.\r\n“I welcome the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Ambassador Vojislav Šuc, who will \r\npresent the report of the Human Rights Council \r\ncontained in documents A/73/53 and A/73/53/Add.1 \r\nto the General Assembly.\r\n“I take this opportunity to highlight the \r\nremarkable efforts of Ambassador Šuc to improve \r\nthe working methods of the Council.\r\n“Upon assuming the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly, I insisted on the importance of making \r\nthe United Nations more relevant to all people. \r\nIn order to achieve that goal, the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council is vital. Since its creation \r\nas a subsidiary body of the General Assembly, the \r\nHuman Rights Council continually contributes, \r\nthrough its various mechanisms, procedures and \r\nresolutions, to the development of international \r\nhuman rights law.\r\n“Furthermore, it undertakes essential work on \r\nthe human rights situation around the world. In that \r\nregard, I highlight the Universal Periodic Review \r\nas a key mechanism for observing the progress \r\nand challenges in the area of  human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms in all countries.\r\n“The protection of human rights is indispensable, \r\nif we want to achieve the main goal of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, namely, to \r\neradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions. In \r\nthat regard, the work of the Human Rights Council \r\ncontributes to the efforts of the General Assembly \r\ntowards the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda and our \r\naim to leave no one behind. We must continue with \r\nour efforts to improve coordination and synergy \r\nbetween the various bodies and mechanisms of the \r\nUnited Nations system, avoiding any duplication or \r\noverlapping of work.\r\n“In December, the General Assembly will \r\nconvene two plenary meetings to commemorate the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights; the twenty-fifth anniversary of \r\nthe Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action \r\nfor Landlocked Developing Countries; and the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the Declaration on the \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

I would like to begin by \r\ncongratulating the 18 newly elected members of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. I have full confidence that \r\nall members will work hard to uphold the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights around the world and \r\nat home.\r\nThis year we celebrate the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. That celebration provides an opportunity for \r\nall of us to review how much we have accomplished, \r\nwhere we stand and what should be our way forward. \r\nThe times are challenging, and our response to those \r\nchallenges should be resolute. That also gives us the \r\nopportunity to assess whether the fundamental role that \r\nhuman rights play within the United Nations system has \r\nbeen sufficiently upheld by the international community \r\nand how we can reinforce that role in future. Bearing \r\nthat in mind, we cannot but recognize that the Human \r\nRights Council has played, in its 12 years of existence, \r\na central role in addressing human rights violations on \r\na global scale.\r\nIt has established well-functioning mechanisms \r\nthrough which it shares information and investigates \r\nand provides recommendations on a variety of human \r\nrights issues, from civil and political to economic, social \r\nand cultural rights. It plays an important role in raising \r\nearly warnings for looming crises. Through technical \r\nassistance and cooperation, it helps build resilience and \r\nstability within our societies.\r\nThis year’s work of the Human Rights Council has \r\nbeen summarized in the report before the Assembly, \r\nwhich lists the activities of as well as the resolutions, \r\ndecisions and President’s statements adopted by the \r\nCouncil at its three regular sessions, as well as at two \r\nspecial sessions, held in December 2017 and May \r\n2018, respectively.\r\nSince December 2017, the Council has adopted 87 \r\nresolutions, of which 53 were adopted without a vote. \r\nSome of the resolutions represented cross-regional \r\ninitiatives, including those on country-specific issues. \r\nThat has reaffirmed the capacity of the Council to take \r\naction on important human rights issues by overcoming \r\ndiffering political positions.\r\nOne such example is resolution 39/2, adopted in \r\nSeptember, on the situation of the human rights of \r\nRohingya Muslims and other minorities in Myanmar. In \r\nthe light of the findings of the Independent International \r\nFact-finding Mission on Myanmar, the Council decided \r\nto establish an independent mechanism to collect, \r\nconsolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of the \r\nmost serious international crimes and violations of \r\ninternational law, as well as to prepare for independent \r\ncriminal proceedings.\r\nSyria has continued to be high on the agenda of the \r\nCouncil throughout the year, and the mandate of the \r\nIndependent International Commission of Inquiry on \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic has been extended for another \r\nyear. The Council has also considered the reports of the \r\nCommission of Inquiry on Burundi and decided to extend \r\nits mandate in order for it to deepen its investigations. \r\nRegarding the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the \r\nCouncil heard the report of the High Commissioner on \r\nthe findings of the team of international experts on the \r\nsituation in the Kasai regions. The Council considered \r\nthe update and the report of the Commission on Human \r\nRights in South Sudan, which is mandated to monitor \r\nthe human rights situation there.\r\nIn September, the Council considered the report of \r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights containing the \r\nfindings of a group of eminent international and regional \r\nexperts with knowledge of human rights law and the \r\ncontext of Yemen. The report found that individuals in \r\nthe Government of Yemen — both from among coalition \r\nmembers and the de facto authorities — had committed \r\nacts that may have amounted to international crimes. In \r\nthe light of those findings, the Council decided to extend \r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 3/29\r\nthe mandate of the group of eminent international and \r\nregional experts for another year.\r\nIn May, the Council held a special session on the \r\ndeteriorating human rights situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. \r\nIt decided to dispatch a commission of inquiry to \r\ninvestigate all violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw and international human rights law in the context \r\nof large-scale civilian protests. During the September \r\nsession, the Council heard an oral update from that \r\ncommission. In 2018, the Council extended the country-\r\nspecific special-procedure mandates regarding Belarus, \r\nthe Central African Republic, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, Eritrea, the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran, Mali, Myanmar, Somalia and the Sudan. \r\nCooperation and collaboration have been at the \r\nforefront of our efforts in the Human Rights Council. \r\nWhile we strive to create an atmosphere  conducive to \r\nconstructive dialogue and cooperation, we have also \r\nspent considerable time discussing the need for better \r\ncooperation within the United Nations system, as well \r\nas how to bridge the disconnect between the three \r\npillars of the United Nations.\r\nThe Council has therefore continued to promote \r\nthe nexus between human rights and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, which was given more prominence \r\nthis year through the adoption of three resolutions. In \r\nthat regard, the Council reaffirmed the central role of the \r\nHigh-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development \r\nand decided to invite the President of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council to brief the Human Rights Council, on an \r\nannual basis, on discussions in the forum. The current \r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council addressed \r\nthe Human Rights Council during the September \r\nsession. Moreover, the Council requested the High \r\nCommissioner to organize two one-day intersessional \r\nmeetings for dialogue and cooperation on human rights \r\nand the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as \r\nwell as to promote human rights and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals through transparent, accountable \r\nand efficient public-service administrations.\r\nIn June, the Council adopted a resolution on \r\nthe contribution that it can make to the prevention \r\nof human rights violations. It decided to convene \r\ntwo intersessional seminars and to establish a group \r\nconsisting of a Chair-rapporteur and two rapporteurs, \r\nwho will consult relevant stakeholders in Geneva and \r\nNew York and present proposals on how the Council \r\ncan effectively contribute to prevention. Among the \r\nthematic resolutions adopted by the Council this \r\nyear were also resolutions on the joint commitment \r\nto countering the world drug problem as it relates to \r\nhuman rights and on promoting mutually beneficial \r\ncooperation in the field of human rights.\r\nLastly, following six years of negotiations in an \r\nopen-ended intergovernmental working group, in \r\nSeptember the Council adopted the text of the United \r\nNations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other \r\nPeople Working in Rural Areas (A/HRC/RES/39/12).\r\nThis year, the Council held 13 panel discussions \r\non various thematic human rights issues. In particular, \r\nit commemorated the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the \r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action. We also marked the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and \r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide. In April, the \r\nCouncil held a high-level intersessional discussion \r\ncelebrating the centenary of Nelson Mandela.\r\nThis year’s high-level panel discussion on human \r\nrights, which involved streaming with the heads and \r\nsenior officials of United Nations agencies, focused on \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights in the \r\nlight of the Universal Periodic Review. The Council was \r\nhonoured to have the former President of the General \r\nAssembly, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, as a participant in that \r\ndiscussion and would be honoured to have the current \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at the Council’s \r\nfortieth session, to be held from 25 February 2019.\r\nI am also pleased to inform the Assembly that \r\nwe have continued to make the work of the Council \r\naccessible to persons with disabilities. During the \r\nthree regular sessions this year, six panels were made \r\naccessible through the provision of international sign \r\nlanguage interpretation, real-time captioning and the \r\nwebcast of these services. I also wish to highlight that, \r\nearly this year, the Council launched its new user-\r\nfriendly website, which offers numerous improvements \r\nand should ease navigation through the Council pages.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to emphasize that the \r\nspecial procedures of the Human Rights Council not only \r\nprovide one of the main sources of up-to-date, reliable \r\ninformation on human rights issues and a solid basis \r\nfor the dialogues and debates at the Council, but could \r\nalso significantly contribute to the early warning and \r\nprevention efforts of the United Nations. It is therefore \r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n4/29 18-35714\r\nvery important for all countries to cooperate and give \r\naccess to the special-procedure mandate holders.\r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that, as of \r\nSeptember, 118 member States and one Observer State \r\nhad extended a standing invitation to thematic special \r\nprocedures. However, I am concerned by the position of \r\nsome States to cooperate only with a select few Council \r\nmechanisms, or not to cooperate at all. I therefore \r\ncall upon all States that have not yet done so to issue \r\nstanding invitations to all special-procedure mandate \r\nholders and to cooperate with them fully.\r\nAllow me now to turn to the Universal Periodic \r\nReview, which is now well into its third cycle and \r\ncontinues to celebrate a 100 per cent participation rate. \r\nIt enjoys strong legitimacy and ownership by Member \r\nStates and is often cited as one of the Council’s greatest \r\nachievements. It provides a constructive forum for a \r\nnon-politicized, non-selective and non-confrontational \r\ndiscussion among peers. The Universal Periodic \r\nReview process provides space, not only for States, but \r\nalso for the active contribution of regional and national \r\nhuman rights mechanisms, civil society and, more \r\nrecently, parliaments. The reviews in the third cycle \r\nwere marked by a high, predominantly ministerial, \r\nlevel of representation in the delegations of the States \r\nunder review. The third cycle of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview is focused on the implementation of and follow-\r\nup to previous recommendations received and accepted \r\nby each State.\r\nThis year, with the continuous and increasing \r\nsupport of States, the Voluntary Technical Assistance \r\nTrust Fund to Support the Participation of Least \r\nDeveloped Countries and Small Island Developing \r\nStates in the Work of the Human Rights Council \r\nenabled the participation of 25 representatives in its \r\nregular sessions. Among those Government officials, \r\n10 were from Africa, five were from Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean, and 10 were from Asia and the \r\nPacific. Furthermore, 14 of them were women, and \r\nsix represented small island developing States that do \r\nnot have permanent representation in Geneva, namely, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Marshall Islands, Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu.\r\nThe active participation of civil society and national \r\nhuman rights institutions is essential to the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, making the Council unique \r\namong other United Nations intergovernmental organs. \r\nIn addition to providing us with first-hand information \r\nfrom the ground, injecting unique perspectives into our \r\ndiscussions and drawing our attention to urgent human \r\nrights situations, civil-society organizations play a \r\nfundamental role in follow-up and capacity-building \r\nefforts in their home countries. Regrettably, however, \r\nin the course of this year, I have continued to receive \r\nallegations of intimidation, threats and reprisals against \r\nindividuals who cooperate with the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. I have repeatedly appealed to the Council to \r\nensure the safe participation of civil society in our work \r\nand, when necessary, I have followed up directly with the \r\nStates concerned. It is critical that the Council remain \r\na safe and inclusive environment where representatives \r\nof civil society can freely express their views on the \r\nsituations of human rights around the world.\r\nLet me now turn to the issues that directly touch \r\nupon the work of the General Assembly. This year the \r\nHuman Rights Council adopted several resolutions \r\nwith recommendations made to the General Assembly. \r\nThrough its resolution 37/29, adopted in March on \r\nthe human rights situation in Syria, the Council \r\nrecommended that the General Assembly submit the \r\nreports of the Independent International Commission \r\nof Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic to the Security \r\nCouncil for appropriate action.\r\nIn its resolution 37/37, on ensuring accountability \r\nand justice for all violations of international law in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, \r\nalso adopted in March, the Council recommended that \r\nthe General Assembly remain informed of the matter.\r\nConcerning the situation of the human rights of \r\nRohingya Muslims and other minorities in Myanmar, \r\nthe Council encouraged the General Assembly to \r\nconsider taking further action to address the serious \r\nhuman rights violations in Myanmar, particularly in \r\nRakhine, Shan and Kachin states. It also encouraged \r\nthe General Assembly to consider the recommendations \r\nof the report of the Independent International Fact-\r\nfinding Mission on Myanmar and to give due regard to \r\nthe establishment of the new independent mechanism.\r\nAt its September session, the Council recommended \r\nthat the General Assembly adopt the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People \r\nWorking in Rural Areas.\r\nFinally, in its resolution 39/13, adopted in September \r\non human rights and indigenous people, the Council \r\ndecided to hold a half-day intersessional interactive \r\ndialogue on ways to enhance the participation of the \r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 5/29\r\nrepresentatives of indigenous peoples in the Council’s \r\nmeeting and invited the President of the General \r\nAssembly to participate. The Council recommended \r\nthat the General Assembly consider the summary report \r\nof that interactive dialogue as well.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to share some \r\nthoughts on the Council’s work. In the 12 years since \r\nits creation, the Human Rights Council has established \r\nitself as the principal intergovernmental body for the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. It is a well-\r\nfunctioning body. It provides an invaluable platform \r\nwhere a wide range of views on difficult human rights \r\nissues can be heard and common solutions to human \r\nrights questions around the world can be found.\r\nThis year, I have been privileged to have a first-\r\nhand experience of the Human Rights Council in action, \r\nand sometimes I have seen the fracturing world that we \r\nare witnessing today playing out in our work. But what \r\nis more important, and for me inspiring, is that I have \r\nalso seen a number of delegations coming together in \r\nthe spirit of compromise and cooperation for the benefit \r\nof human rights. The Council has many good stories to \r\ntell, but as is the case with everything in this imperfect \r\nworld, it also has its fair share of shortcomings. The \r\nefficiency and effectiveness of the Council’s work \r\nseems to be the most pressing one and has been at the \r\nforefront of our agenda for some time now. Together \r\nwith the Bureau of the Council I have initiated a process \r\nguided by our co-facilitators, which through informal \r\nopen-ended consultations seeks to identify long-term \r\nmeasures that could improve efficiency, strengthen the \r\nCouncil and rationalize its work. The process focuses \r\non three aspects: first, reducing the workload and \r\nthe number of meeting hours of the Council during \r\nits regular sessions; secondly, the rationalization of \r\nresolutions and initiatives, and thirdly, the use of modern \r\ntechnology. We have held three rounds of consultations \r\nso far and will continue in November with a view to \r\nreaching an agreement at the organizational session on \r\n3 December.\r\nThis year as well, I have been given a rare \r\nopportunity to gain an insider’s view of the strengths \r\nand weaknesses of the Human Rights Council and, I \r\nmay say, of the entire United Nations system. While \r\nrealizing how imperfect the United Nations system can \r\nbe, I have also become even more convinced that, in this \r\nfractured world, it represents our lifeline, protecting us \r\nfrom slipping back into the dark periods of our history.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that I am extremely proud \r\nto lead the Human Rights Council this year. It is my \r\nsincere desire to see the Council successfully overcome \r\nits challenges and come out even stronger so that it \r\ncan continue improving the lives of the people around \r\nthe world.\r\nAs my term will come to an end in December, I wish \r\nto assure the Assembly of my commitment to seeing a \r\nsuccessful transition of the presidency and hope that the \r\nGeneral Assembly will continue to support the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council in the years to come.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nPresident Šuc for having introduced the report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council.\r\nMr. Gumende (Mozambique): Allow me at the \r\noutset to welcome Ambassador Vojislav Šuc, the \r\ncurrent President of the Human Rights Council. The \r\nGroup of African States would like to thank him for his \r\npresentation today of the annual report of the Council \r\n(A/73/53 and A/73/53/Add.1) and to congratulate him on \r\nhis dedicated and tireless efforts during the tenure of \r\nhis presidency of the Council.\r\nThe African Group would like to reaffirm the \r\nCouncil’s mandate as a principal United Nations body \r\nof the first instance responsible for ensuring universal \r\nrespect for the protection of all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of \r\nany kind and in a fair and equal manner, as enshrined in \r\nfounding resolution 60/251. The African Group further \r\nwishes to reaffirm resolution 65/281, of 17 June 2011, \r\non the review of the Council, by which the Assembly \r\nmaintained the status of the Human Rights Council as \r\na subsidiary body of the General Assembly. The Group \r\nrecalls that the Council’s mandate should be driven by \r\nthe principles of cooperation and genuine dialogue, free \r\nfrom politicization, selectivity and double standards\r\nAfrica remains convinced that the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review is the sole mechanism for the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council in the fulfilment of the \r\nhuman rights obligations of States and the improvement \r\nof the situation on the ground. In realizing that objective, \r\nthe recommendations of the United Nations Voluntary \r\nFund for Financial and Technical Assistance for the \r\nImplementation of the Universal Periodic Review must \r\nbe properly resourced so as to be able to assist States to \r\ndevelop national capacity and expertise.\r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n6/29 18-35714\r\nThe Group reaffirms the Vienna Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action adopted at the third World \r\nConference on Human Rights, on 25 June 1993. That \r\noutcome fundamentally underlines that all human \r\nrights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and \r\ninterrelated, and that the right to development is a \r\nuniversal, inalienable right and an integral part of \r\nfundamental human rights.\r\nThe African Group reaffirms resolution 60/251 in \r\npromoting universal respect for the protection of all human \r\nrights, including its subsequent institution-building \r\npackage, which marked the foundation of the Human \r\nRights Council and provided its mandate. The Group \r\nstresses that that resolution affirmed the need to respect \r\nregional particularities and the various historical, \r\ncultural and religious backgrounds, while promoting \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, and therefore \r\ncondemns the attempts of some States to impose their \r\nvalues in contradiction to the resolution.\r\nIn that regard, the Group notes with concern the \r\nincreasingly non-consensual nature by which Human \r\nRights Council resolutions are adopted. We would \r\npoint, for example, to Human Rights Council resolution \r\n39/10, entitled “Preventable maternal mortality and \r\nmorbidity and human rights in humanitarian settings”, \r\nwhich should have been adopted by consensus, but was \r\nunfortunately politicized by the inclusion of highly \r\ncontroversial language.\r\nThe Group also deplores the lack of constructive \r\nengagement by the global North in the work of the \r\nintergovernmental working group on transnational \r\ncompanies and other business enterprises and human \r\nrights, as the working group seeks to make progress in \r\nthe negotiations on an internationally and legally binding \r\ninstrument, as per Human Rights Council resolution \r\n26/9. The mandate of the Human Rights Council can be \r\nimplemented effectively only if it is applied on the basis \r\nof the principles of non-politicization, non-selectivity, \r\nobjectivity, universality, international cooperation \r\nand within the context of a genuine intergovernmental \r\ndialogue to address human rights issues, while \r\nrefraining from targeting human rights situations only \r\nin particular countries.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights \r\nand the prevention of human rights violations can \r\nbe attained through the building of the resilience of \r\nsocieties and through technical cooperation, solidarity \r\nand mutual respect. We note the important role of \r\ntechnical assistance and capacity-building in supporting \r\nStates’ efforts to promote and protect human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms upon the request of States and \r\nbased on their needs and priorities.\r\nThe process of strengthening the efficiency of the \r\nHuman Rights Council should be guided by the principles \r\nof transparency, inclusiveness and non-discrimination, \r\nand should be in conformity with the letter and spirit of \r\nthe institution-building package of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. Any agreed measures should be adopted by a \r\nconsensual decision of the Human Rights Council. All \r\nissues on the agenda of that Council should be treated \r\non an equal and non-discriminatory basis.\r\nThe African Group reaffirms the universality, \r\nindivisibility, interrelatedness and interdependence \r\nof all human rights. Civil and political rights, as well \r\neconomic and social rights, including the right to \r\ndevelopment, should be addressed in a fair and equitable \r\nmanner, with the same emphasis and on an equal footing. \r\nThe African Group reiterates its principled position on \r\nthe notion of the justiciability of economic, social and \r\ncultural rights and their progressive realization, which \r\nis informed by a recognition that extreme poverty and \r\nsocial exclusion constitute a violation of human dignity \r\nand that urgent steps are necessary in order to achieve \r\na better knowledge of extreme poverty and its causes, \r\nthrough the realization of the right to development. A \r\ntroubling aspect of what is going on is the negation of \r\nsocioeconomic and cultural rights. We do not believe in \r\nthe hierarchy of rights that seems to underlie the human \r\nrights-based approach. We cannot promote one set of \r\nrights at the exclusion of others and hope to achieve the \r\ninculcation of human rights consciousness everywhere \r\nin the world.\r\nThe Group would like to reaffirm the mandate of \r\nthe Third Committee to examine the work of the Human \r\nRights Council through the adoption of its annual \r\nreport by that Committee. We have noted the growing \r\nattempts to undermine that mandate by proposing that \r\nthe report of the Human Rights Council be submitted to \r\nthe General Assembly without the endorsement of the \r\nThird Committee. The Group therefore wishes to caution \r\nagainst setting such a precedent for the methods of work \r\nof the General Assembly and its subsidiary bodies. Any \r\nchanges to the mandate will require the endorsement \r\nof the universal membership, through an inclusive \r\nintergovernmental process. To that end, the African \r\nGroup will continue to present its annual resolution on \r\nthe adoption of the Human Rights Council report.\r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 7/29\r\nIn conclusion, the African Group wishes to assure \r\nthe Assembly of its support and cooperation in leading \r\nthe Council towards the fulfilment of its mandate.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to the observer of the European Union.\r\nMs. Brito Maneira (European Union): This year \r\nwe mark the seventieth anniversary of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment \r\nof the Crime of Genocide, the twenty-fifth anniversary \r\nof the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action \r\nadopted at the World Conference on Human Rights \r\nand the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration on the \r\nRight and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and \r\nOrgans of Society to Promote and Protect Universally \r\nRecognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\r\nOn this occasion, the European Union would like \r\nto pay tribute to the late former Secretary-General, \r\nKofi Annan, whose vision informed the creation of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. He said,\r\n“The cause of human rights has entered a new \r\nera. For much of the past 60 years, our focus has been \r\non articulating, codifying and enshrining rights. \r\nThat effort produced a remarkable framework of \r\nlaws, standards and mechanisms — the Universal \r\nDeclaration, the international covenants, and much \r\nelse. Such work needs to continue in some areas. \r\nBut the era of declaration is now giving way, as it \r\nshould, to an era of implementation.”\r\nKofi Annan has left us in the year of the centenary of \r\nthe birth of Nelson Mandela — two giants in the history \r\nof humankind, whose legacies should be celebrated \r\ntogether. They embodied the principles of our shared \r\nhumanity and the universality of the laws, values and \r\nprinciples that we should lean on as the basis of our \r\njoint efforts.\r\nThe European Union and its member States would \r\nlike to warmly thank the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Ambassador Vojislav Šuc, for presenting the \r\nCouncil’s annual report (A/73/53 and A/73/53/Add.1) \r\nand for his able stewardship of the work of the Council \r\nin 2018, including his efforts to improve its efficiency. \r\nThe European Union has strongly supported the \r\nHuman Rights Council and its independence since its \r\nestablishment and continues to do so.\r\nTwelve years have passed since the General \r\nAssembly established the Human Rights Council, and \r\nmuch has been achieved. The Human Rights Council \r\nis adjusting to new realities and delivering on various \r\nparts of its mandate. The new High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights delivered her first statement to the Human \r\nRights Council in September, reminding us all that the \r\npromotion of human rights is a powerful medicine that \r\nheals wounds and develops resilience. The EU stands \r\nready to cooperate closely with her and the Office, as \r\nwe cooperated with her predecessors.\r\nOn 12 October, the General Assembly elected 18 \r\nnew members of the Council. Serving as a Council \r\nmember entails important responsibilities. Resolution \r\n60/251 provides that members elected to the Council \r\nshall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights and shall fully cooperate \r\nwith the Council. While we congratulate the new \r\nmembers, we also remind them to give due importance \r\nto the human rights situation in their own countries \r\nand to cooperate with the Council’s mechanisms in the \r\npromotion and protection of the human rights of all, \r\nwithout discrimination of any kind.\r\nNo State has a perfect human rights record, but we \r\nparticularly expect from the newly elected members \r\nthat they will engage in the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in a spirit of self-reflection with a view to \r\nimproving their own human rights situation and to \r\naddressing all human rights concerns that come before \r\nthe Council on their merits. We also strongly encourage \r\nall States and other stakeholders to cooperate with \r\nthe special procedures as a means to enhance the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights. We take this \r\nopportunity to call on all States that have not done so to \r\nextend a standing invitation to all special procedures.\r\nIn 2018, under the able leadership of Ambassador \r\nŠuc and thanks to the work of the co-facilitators, the \r\nHuman Rights Council has recommitted to improving \r\nits efficiency. That ongoing process has already \r\nproduced positive results, including a significant \r\nstreamlining of the number of resolutions presented and \r\nthe moving of some thematic resolutions to a biennial \r\nor triennial basis. That allows for stronger engagement \r\nfrom all stakeholders, creates more space for dialogue \r\nand reinforces ownership.\r\nThe EU is firmly committed to the process of \r\nstrengthening the Council’s efficiency and will continue \r\nto engage constructively in an inclusive cross-regional \r\nprocess of reflection, dialogue and review in Geneva \r\nand in close partnership with all relevant stakeholders, \r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n8/29 18-35714\r\nincluding civil society, and focusing on the Council’s \r\nworking methods, efficiency, effectiveness and impact. \r\nFor the EU, it is crucial to further improve synergies \r\nbetween the Human Rights Council and the Third \r\nCommittee, while at the same time ensuring that \r\nthe mandate, independence and work of the Human \r\nRights Council is respected. Moreover, we welcome \r\nconsistency between the work of the Council, the \r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary \r\nQuestions and the Fifth Committee, with a view to \r\nensuring that the activities mandated by the Human \r\nRights Council are appropriately funded and can be \r\nduly implemented.\r\nThe Council’s mandate to contribute through \r\ndialogue and cooperation to the prevention of human \r\nrights violations and abuses and to respond promptly to \r\nhuman rights emergencies must be fully operationalized \r\nin order to translate early warning into early action. \r\nThe Council’s existing mechanisms can be better used \r\nto play that stronger preventive role, including by \r\ntransferring reports and other materials to the Security \r\nCouncil when relevant. The EU looks forward to \r\ncontinuing to contribute to the full implementation of \r\nthe Human Rights Council’s wide mandate, given it by \r\nthe General Assembly in its resolution 60/251, namely, \r\nthrough the new process established by Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolution 38/18 to assess how the Council can \r\nbetter implement its prevention mandate.\r\nDuring the September session of the Council, \r\nthe EU delivered a statement supported by Japan, \r\nNorway, Turkey, Australia, the Republic of Korea, \r\nRussia, Ukraine, Montenegro, Georgia, Albania, \r\nIceland, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Ghana and \r\nArmenia, recalling the rules and established practices \r\nof intergovernmental working groups and, inter alia, \r\nthe responsibility of those who are leading a process \r\nto return to the Council for a renewal of its programme \r\nof work, in order to ensure that its endeavours and \r\nresources reflect, and are accountable to, the democratic \r\nwill of the members of the Council.\r\nThe EU welcomes the strong condemnation by the \r\nHuman Rights Council of discrimination and gender-\r\nbased violence against women and girls in all its forms, \r\nonline and offline, in both public and private spaces. \r\nWe strongly support the call made to States to develop \r\ninclusive gender-responsive policies and regulations, as \r\nwell as to repeal all laws and policies that exclusively \r\nor disproportionately criminalize women’s and girls’ \r\nactions or behaviours and that discriminate against \r\nthem, based on any grounds, including custom, \r\ntradition or cultural or religious interpretation contrary \r\nto the international obligation to eliminate all forms \r\nof violence and discrimination against women and \r\ngirls. We are encouraged by the decisions calling for \r\nthe mainstreaming of women’s and girls’ rights into all \r\nhumanitarian action, as well as efforts to implement \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its \r\nSustainable Development Goals, and we encourage all \r\ndevelopment and humanitarian actors to ensure that \r\ntheir operations and actions adhere to the principles of \r\nequality and non-discrimination and seek to promote \r\nwomen’s and girls’ full enjoyment of all human rights \r\nacross the board.\r\nCivil society and human rights defenders play \r\na crucial and instrumental role in the work of the \r\nCouncil and its mechanisms. Targeting individuals or \r\ngroups that engage with United Nations human rights \r\nmechanisms is unacceptable and runs contrary to the \r\npromotion, protection and fulfilment of human rights. \r\nThe European Union strongly condemns any act of \r\nviolence, harassment, intimidation, reprisal or threat \r\nthereof. The ability of individuals and groups to raise \r\nconcerns with the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s special procedures and other mechanisms \r\nwithout fear of reprisals is vital for the work of those \r\nmechanisms and their capacity to fulfil their mandates. \r\nThe issue of reprisals needs a consistent approach at the \r\ninternational and regional levels. All States represented \r\nin this Hall have an obligation to do all in their power \r\nto prevent and eliminate such acts. Civil society and \r\nits representatives are valuable partners for States and \r\nhuman right mechanisms and for the enhancement of \r\nthe universal protection and promotion of human rights.\r\nWe underline the vital importance of countering \r\nintimidation and reprisals against those seeking to \r\ncooperate with the United Nations and its mechanisms \r\nand the role that we must all play in ensuring a robust \r\nresponse. We support the mandate and work of the \r\nAssistant Secretary-General for Human Rights in that \r\nrespect and welcome the holding of the first interactive \r\ndialogue on that matter within the Council and the \r\nsustained efforts that are being made on the issue.\r\nThe EU welcomes the central role played by the \r\nHuman Rights Council in addressing human rights \r\nsituations throughout the world. In September, the \r\nIndependent International Fact-Finding Mission on \r\nMyanmar presented its final report (A/HRC/39/64) to \r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 9/29\r\nthe Council. The report provides a harrowing account \r\nof the human rights situation in Myanmar, pointing to \r\nthe possible commission of genocide in Rakhine state \r\nand containing findings that crimes against humanity \r\nhave been committed in Kachin, Rakhine and Shan \r\nstates by the military and security forces. The findings \r\nalso point to the commission by ethnically based armed \r\norganizations of human rights abuses and violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nThe EU therefore welcomes the fact that the \r\nHuman Rights Council acted on its responsibility to \r\nadequately address those extremely grave findings \r\nand to pursue accountability through its decision to \r\nestablish a mechanism to collect, consolidate, preserve \r\nand analyse evidence of the most serious international \r\ncrimes and violations of international law and to \r\nfacilitate fair and independent criminal proceedings \r\nin national, regional or international courts. The EU \r\nis pleased that the mechanism was established through \r\na joint resolution (Human Rights Council resolution \r\n34/22) presented — for the first time in the Council’s \r\nhistory — on behalf of the EU and the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation (OIC). We are grateful for the close \r\nand very constructive cooperation that we have had \r\nwith the OIC throughout that process. That is testament \r\nto the important results that the Council can achieve \r\nwhen we work together across different regional groups \r\non situations where we share a common concern.\r\nThe EU welcomes the renewal of the mandate of \r\nthe Commission of Inquiry on Burundi and calls on \r\nthe Government of Burundi to cooperate fully with the \r\nCommission, as well as with other international human \r\nrights mechanisms. As stated in the Council’s founding \r\nresolution, members of the Human Rights Council \r\nshall uphold the highest standards in the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights, both domestically and \r\ninternationally. We reiterate our urgent call on the \r\nGovernment of Burundi to do so, and we condemn all \r\nthreats against the Commission’s members, as well as \r\nreprisals against those who cooperate with it.\r\nThe severe consequences of the crisis in Syria and \r\nthe violations committed by all parties, particularly the \r\nSyrian regime and its allies, cannot be ignored by any \r\nState. Any violations of international law, including \r\ninternational humanitarian law and international human \r\nrights law, some of which may constitute war crimes or \r\ncrimes against humanity, must be brought to justice. In \r\nthat context, the Council’s ongoing response to the crisis \r\nremains critically important, as demonstrated by efforts \r\nto foster accountability and fight against impunity.\r\nThe EU welcomes the renewal of the mandate of the \r\neminent international and regional experts to monitor \r\nand report on the human rights situation in Yemen and to \r\ncontinue to carry out the comprehensive examination of \r\nall alleged violations and abuses of international human \r\nrights law and other appropriate and applicable fields \r\nof international law committed by all parties. We call \r\non all parties to corporate fully with the investigative \r\nmechanism for Yemen.\r\nDuring the past year, the Human Rights Council has \r\nalso demonstrated its commitment to provide technical \r\nassistance and capacity-building for promoting human \r\nrights to the Governments of the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, Libya, Mali, the Sudan, Somalia and the \r\nCentral African Republic. We also welcome the adoption \r\nof a resolution initiated by a group of countries in the \r\nregion requesting the Office of the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights to monitor the human rights situation \r\nin Venezuela. We furthermore welcome the continued \r\nsupport rendered to Georgia and Ukraine.\r\nThe twenty-eighth special session of the Council \r\nalso clearly indicated that continued attention should \r\nbe paid to the situation of concern in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. We \r\ntrust that the Council will continue to closely monitor \r\nsituations where technical assistance and capacity-\r\nbuilding can make a difference and to take action when \r\nnecessary. The EU calls for unfettered access to all \r\nterritories to be granted to international human rights \r\nmonitoring mechanisms.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the human rights situation \r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo will remain \r\non the Council’s agenda, which will ensure close \r\nmonitoring before, during and after the elections. We \r\nalso welcome the fact that the provision of technical \r\nassistance and capacity-building to the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo will continue through continued \r\ntechnical support to national investigations and the \r\nspecial mechanism for accountability and justice for \r\ncrimes committed in the Kasai region. We wish to \r\nstress that human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nare key preconditions for ensuring credible, peaceful, \r\ntransparent and inclusive elections and require \r\nthe implementation of important steps, including \r\nconfidence-building measures.\r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n10/29 18-35714\r\nBeing a member of the Council increases a country’s \r\nresponsibility to cooperate with its mechanisms and \r\nto uphold the highest standards in the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights. The EU therefore \r\nparticularly regrets that any Member State, in particular \r\none that is a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nshould try to prevent a Council-mandated briefing by \r\na commission of inquiry, much less make threats or \r\ninflammatory statements during such a briefing. As the \r\nHigh Commissioner has said, States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations should show respect to the institutions \r\nand the various bodies, laws and mechanisms that the \r\nOrganization has established.\r\nWe also welcome the extension of the country-\r\nspecific mandates of the Special Rapporteurs on \r\nthe human rights situations in Myanmar, Iran, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Eritrea and \r\nBelarus, and the extension of the mandate of the \r\nCommission on Human Rights in South Sudan. Through \r\njoint statements, the Council has also addressed the \r\nsituations in Cambodia, the Philippines, Nicaragua \r\nand Maldives.\r\nHuman Rights Council mechanisms, including \r\nthe system of special procedures, the establishment \r\nof accountability mechanisms and the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review, have contributed positively to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights worldwide. \r\nThrough its delivery on its technical-assistance and \r\ncapacity-building mandates, the Council has helped \r\ncountries deal with human rights crises and build \r\nhuman rights protections policies and fulfil their \r\ninternational obligations.\r\nThe mechanisms of the Human Rights Council \r\nare strong medicine that can heal wounds and develop \r\nresilience. The European Union will continue to do its \r\npart in engaging with the mechanisms of the Council \r\nand all stakeholders working to promote and protect \r\nhuman rights, including by presenting draft resolutions \r\non the rights of the child, together with the Group of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, and on the \r\nfreedom of religion and belief, as well as on various \r\ncountry situations.\r\nMr. Opimah (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\nHuman Rights Council was originally envisaged as a \r\nbody that would play an important role in the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights, based on the principles \r\nof constructive cooperation and genuine dialogue. If \r\nthat were the role actually played by the Council, we \r\nwould welcome that role. However, the reality is such \r\nthat we cannot do so. The proceedings of the Human \r\nRights Council remain excessively politicized and \r\nbogged down by initiatives that are not supported by \r\nconsensus. That situation cannot but undermine trust in \r\nthe Council, its resolutions and their objectivity.\r\nIn the light of that situation, Belarus calls for the \r\ngreater development of the work of the cooperation \r\nmechanisms in the Council and other forms of dialogue, \r\nsuch as the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). The UPR \r\nprocedure has secured overall support through clear, \r\nexplicit criteria that apply uniformly to all States. At \r\nthe same time, country-specific initiatives, which \r\nare rubber-stamped by the Council, are based on the \r\nsubjective views and assessments of certain States \r\nor groups of States. The operations of the numerous \r\nspecial procedures established by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil must also be based on cooperation and dialogue \r\nwith States.\r\nUnfortunately, certain special procedures are \r\nbiased in their work and subject to external influence. \r\nWe believe that it is of critical importance to reduce the \r\nlevel of confrontation when a country is the subject of \r\na country-specific consideration. We also believe that it \r\nis important to put an end to the practice of including \r\ncountry-specific issues for consideration on the thematic \r\nagenda of the Human Rights Council. It is not acceptable \r\nthat reports on country-specific situations should be \r\ndrafted by the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights without a mandate based on relevant \r\nCouncil resolutions. The Council report before us today \r\n(A/73/53 and A/73/53 Add.1) fully reflects the problems \r\nthat I have mentioned. Since the report lists resolutions \r\nthat are not acceptable to Belarus, our delegation cannot \r\nsupport that document.\r\nMr. Aldahhak (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): The delegation of my country, the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, reiterates its steadfast position, namely, that \r\nwe reject the politicization of human rights issues and \r\nmechanisms and their use as a political tool to serve \r\nthe interests of certain influential countries in this \r\nOrganization. They target Member States, including \r\nmy country, for reasons that have nothing to do with \r\ninternational law, the Charter of the United Nations or \r\nhuman rights instruments and values.\r\nMy delegation strongly rejects any efforts to deal \r\nwith human rights issues using double standards and \r\nshameful selectivity that focuses on certain countries \r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 11/29\r\nwhile ignoring the wars of aggression, war crimes, \r\nsupport for terrorism and serious violations of human \r\nrights committed by certain Governments of States \r\nMembers of the Organization. They do so individually at \r\ntimes or in the context of internationally illegal alliances \r\ncreated outside the United Nations. Among such illegal \r\nalliances is the illegal alliance led by the United States \r\nof America, which has been committing crimes, one \r\nafter the other, against civilians in my country and \r\ndestroying civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, \r\nschools, dams and bridges without any moral deterrent \r\nor fear of being called to account in any way.\r\nHuman rights issues are holistic. If we wish to deal \r\nwith human rights, we must do so with professionalism, \r\ncredibility, impartiality and avoid shameful practices \r\nsuch as fabrication, antagonism, confrontation, \r\naccusations and attempts to isolate others. In that \r\nregard, the delegation of my country strongly condemns \r\nthe pressures brought to bear by certain well-known \r\nGovernments on human rights mechanisms, including \r\nthe Human Rights Council, by withdrawing from \r\nthem or threatening to do so or exerting economic \r\nand financial pressures by cutting off funding, with a \r\nview to covering up the crimes they commit together \r\nwith their allies. We also condemn the attempt to \r\ninterfere with agenda items of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in a manner that serves the purposes of the \r\nIsraeli occupation of the Arab occupied territories. My \r\ndelegation also rejects, attempts to blur the boundary \r\nbetween the mandates of the Security Council and the \r\nHuman Rights Council in order to serve the special \r\nagendas of certain Western States that are permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation stresses that the crimes and the \r\nserious violations of international law, international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights instruments \r\nthat are being committed by the Israeli occupation \r\nauthorities against the residents of the occupied Syrian \r\nGolan and other Arab occupied territories must come \r\nto an end. We also call for an immediate end to the \r\ncrimes of the illegal international coalition operating \r\nin my country and its support for terrorism. The illegal \r\ncoalition has completely destroyed the city of Raqqa, \r\nusing prohibited weapons against civilians, including \r\nwhite phosphorus. Recently, we found mass graves \r\ncontaining the bodies and remains of more than 4,000 \r\nSyrians, most of them children and women, who died \r\nbecause of the acts of aggression perpetrated by that \r\nillegal coalition. Of course, those crimes and the crimes \r\ncommitted by terrorist organizations, along with the \r\npractices of States supporting terrorism, do not find \r\ntheir way into the reports of Human Rights Council or \r\nthe United Nations, given the politicization, selectivity \r\nand double standards of the human rights agenda.\r\nDespite the hundreds of letters that we have sent \r\nand the claims made by many representatives of States \r\nMembers of the Organization that they are keen to \r\nprotect human rights and the rule of law, this situation \r\nrequires immediate action under the auspices of United \r\nNations, including serious and firm steps to effectively \r\npromote the equal treatment of States, international \r\nlaw and the Charter. The seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights provides a good \r\nopportunity to review and reform the situation.\r\nWe listened to the statement made earlier by the \r\nEuropean Union, which referred to what it termed the \r\nhuman rights situation in my country Syria. In that \r\nrespect, the delegation of my country reiterates its call \r\non European countries to raise their voice against the \r\nGovernments that support terrorism. They should not \r\njust talk about those issues behind closed doors. That \r\nis shameful. People pay in blood for the price of their \r\nsilence. Firm actions should be taken to end terrorism.\r\nWe also call for the lifting of the unilateral economic \r\ncoercive sanctions imposed on Syrians, which represent \r\na violation of their rights and a collective punishment \r\nimposed by Europe and others, which contravenes \r\nthe principles of international law, the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the principles of justice. We call \r\non European countries that participate in the illegal \r\ncoalition to immediately withdraw from it and to \r\ndistance themselves from the crimes committed by that \r\ncoalition and its brutal violations of human rights and \r\nSyrian civilians.\r\nThe discourse of racism, hate and extremism must \r\nbe brought to an end, as should the violent practices \r\ncommitted against refugees and migrants, including \r\nSyrians. There should be no politicization of humanitarian \r\nand development work, which should not be linked \r\nwith politicized conditions that totally contravene the \r\nprinciples of humanitarian and development work. The \r\nefforts of the Syrian Government must be supported \r\nin order to help the refugees and migrants attain their \r\ngoal of returning to their homeland Syria in a safe and \r\ndignified manner.\r\nMrs. Elmarmuri (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to extend its thanks \r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n12/29 18-35714\r\nto Mr. Vojislav Šuc, President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, for the report presented to the Assembly \r\n(A/73/53 and A/73/53/Add.1), of which we have taken \r\nnote. My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Mozambique on behalf of \r\nthe African Group.\r\nWhile we stress the importance of solidifying and \r\npromoting human rights, we cannot but feel concern at \r\nthe attempts of some to politicize those values, exploit \r\nthem for political ends and impose their cultures on \r\nother societies. It is necessary to respect the cultural and \r\nsocial diversity existing among peoples. In that respect, \r\nmy country reaffirms its sovereign right to reject or \r\nhold reservations with respect to any international \r\ninstrument that includes language that goes against our \r\napplicable national law. We also reject any attempt to \r\ninclude in resolutions any concepts that do not enjoy \r\nconsensus among all Member States or do not figure in \r\nthe relevant international conventions.\r\nWhen we address human rights concepts, we must \r\naddress illegal migration and the exploitation and \r\nrights violations faced by illegal migrants. That issue \r\nhas been subject to the attention of numerous States, \r\ninternational and legal organizations. Libya is itself a \r\nvictim as a transit country for illegal migration. We \r\nshare the concerns regarding that issue and seek to \r\naddress the influx of illegal migrants and to prevent \r\nsmuggler groups from exploiting them, while limiting \r\nthe risks that such people face when crossing the \r\nSahara, entering Libya and departing by sea for Europe.\r\nMy country is among those most affected by \r\nillegal migration, especially during this transitional \r\nperiod characterized by weak State institutions and \r\nfalling export revenues, which have negative effects \r\non our national economy and the State’s ability to \r\ntackle the challenges of illegal migration, as does \r\nanother issue related to that crisis, namely, the need to \r\ncombat terrorism.\r\nMy country will spare no effort to cooperate with \r\nthe relevant international and regional organizations, \r\ndespite all of the security, financial and political \r\nchallenges that we are facing. I would like to mention, \r\nfor example, the ongoing cooperation between Libya \r\nand the International Organization for Migration, and \r\nthe European Union’s civilian Border Management \r\nAssistance Mission. This year, Libya has signed \r\ntwo cooperation agreements with our neighbouring \r\ncountries, the Sudan, Chad and the Niger, aimed \r\nat controlling the borders and putting an end to the \r\nactivities of smuggling groups and terrorist gangs.\r\nAt the national level, we have developed a strategy \r\naimed at dealing with the negative effects of illegal \r\nmigration and at improving the situation of migrants. \r\nOut of the 53 accommodation centres, 18 are now closed. \r\nWe also promote programmes for the voluntary return \r\nof refugees to their countries or for their resettlement in \r\na third country.\r\nWith regard to saving migrants from drowning in \r\nthe Mediterranean Sea off the Libyan coast, the Libyan \r\nCoast Guard has been working very hard to deal with \r\nthe situation, including by initiating search and rescue \r\noperations, despite its limited capacity. We have been \r\nsending out patrols all day long and have set up 10 \r\ncentres along the Libyan coast that receive migrants \r\nwho have been rescued at sea. In fact, we have saved \r\nthousands of migrants, including women and children.\r\nDespite all my country’s efforts, Libya still suffers \r\nfrom the negative consequences of illegal migration, \r\nwhich has affected security and the economy. Libya \r\nis experiencing extremely difficult circumstances, \r\nexacerbated by the influx of migrants, which burdens the \r\nState. As a transit country for illegal migration, Libya \r\nis suffering owing to the reluctance of the countries \r\nof origin to control their borders, and because the \r\ncountries of destination have been slow to find radical \r\nand effective solutions to address the phenomenon.\r\nThe radical solution to illegal migration is to \r\naddress the reasons that cause people to leave their \r\ncountries, and not to focus solely on the security \r\ndimension. That is a challenge that requires a firm \r\ncollective  international stance aimed at helping poor \r\ncountries that export migration implement development \r\nprogrammes aimed at improving their living conditions \r\nby supporting small and medium-sized businesses \r\nand by creating employment opportunities in those \r\ncountries. We welcome the global compact for safe, \r\norderly and regular migration, which will be adopted \r\nby the intergovernmental conference in Marrakech in \r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco in December. While we agree \r\non the urgent need to protect the rights of migrants as \r\nmuch as possible, my country believes that the global \r\ncompact should address the issue of migration in \r\ngreater depth. We call on the international community, \r\nin particular the countries of origin and destination, to \r\nwork together and shoulder their responsibilities in that \r\nregard and not to lay the responsibility on the shoulders \r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 13/29\r\nof transit countries such as Libya, which is a victim, not \r\nthe cause of the problem.\r\nMy country emphasizes that the violations that \r\naccompany the conflict and post-conflict phases, \r\nwhich are mentioned in the report, are not systematic \r\nviolations but are perpetrated against illegal migrants \r\nand citizens by transnational criminal gangs that take \r\nadvantage of the difficult transition phase that we in \r\nLibya are now in. They cannot be attributed to my \r\nGovernment, which strives to overcome the violations \r\nand punish the perpetrators, allowing no impunity. In \r\nthat regard, the Libyan authorities call for international \r\nassistance aimed at overcoming the security crisis in our \r\ncountry by providing the necessary support to our law-\r\nenforcement authorities. In that way, they will be able \r\nto perform their role and promote security and stability, \r\nwhile controlling the factors and circumstances that \r\nlead to  violations of international humanitarian law.\r\nIn conclusion, my country stresses the importance \r\nof respecting, protecting and promoting the human \r\nrights enshrined in all of the international instruments \r\nto which we are a party. We underscore that the Libyan \r\nGovernment is keen to support comprehensive national \r\nreconciliation efforts, while working to achieve security \r\nand stability throughout Libya.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): We thank the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council for presenting \r\nthe comprehensive and informative report on the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council (A/73/53 and A/73/53/\r\nAdd.1).\r\nThe Human Rights Council has once again lived up \r\nto its role as the central and permanent human rights \r\nbody of the United Nations. Its developing body of \r\nspecial procedures and mechanisms represent major \r\nachievements, as does the Universal Periodic Review, \r\nwhose integrity and universal nature must be preserved. \r\nAs a strong supporter of the Human Rights Council, we \r\nalso see significant room for improvement in a number \r\nof areas. As pointed out by other speakers, not all \r\nprovisions of the Council’s founding resolution 60/251 \r\nhave been implemented in practice. As paragraph \r\n9 of the resolution stipulates, Council members \r\n“shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights”. That is a political \r\ncommitment that is binding on the General Assembly \r\nmembership. States must live up to that responsibility \r\nwhen electing members to the Council. We call on \r\nall States to publicly renew that commitment and to \r\nadapt their election practices accordingly. In order to \r\nhelp strengthen the Council’s mission and daily work, \r\nStates that do not fulfil such criteria should not be \r\nelected to the Council. Liechtenstein has followed that \r\npractice consistently, even in situations where regional \r\ngroups present clean slates for elections. The consistent \r\nimplementation of such a policy by others would help to \r\nprotect the Council from political attack and enhance \r\nits effectiveness in its daily work.\r\nLiechtenstein supports calls for greater efficiency \r\nand effectiveness in the work of the Council and for \r\nefforts to review its working methods and priority-\r\nsetting. Going forward, the Council should build on \r\nthe experience and best practices of the entire United \r\nNations system. It should draw on resolution 60/251 and \r\nresolution 65/281, on the review of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. The understandings reached by the broadest \r\npossible consensus among Member States in those \r\nprocesses must be preserved, in particular in the area of \r\nthe institutional relationship with the Assembly.\r\nOur long-standing concerns about the situation \r\nin Myanmar have found their tragic and full-scale \r\nexpression in the report of the Independent International \r\nFact-Finding Mission established by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil (A/HRC/39/64). Consistent patterns of serious \r\nhuman rights violations and abuses, in addition to serious \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law, rape and \r\nother forms of sexual violence, were perpetrated on a \r\nmassive scale and as the result of what appears to be a \r\npolicy by the authorities. In the light of the pervasive \r\nculture of impunity at the national level, the Mission \r\nfinds that the impetus for accountability must come \r\nfrom the international community. It recommends that \r\nthose responsible should be investigated and prosecuted \r\nfor genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. \r\nWe commend the clear stance of the Fact-Finding \r\nMission that such crimes should be referred to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) as the permanent \r\ncourt dedicated to dealing with the most serious crimes \r\nunder international law.\r\nWe welcome the decision of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, adopted by an overwhelming majority, \r\nto establish an independent mechanism to collect, \r\nconsolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of the \r\nmost serious international crimes and violations of \r\ninternational law committed in Myanmar since 2011, \r\nand to prepare a dossier in order to facilitate and \r\nexpedite criminal proceedings. We applaud the fact \r\nthat the Council has adopted that recent and innovative \r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n14/29 18-35714\r\nformat so as to advance justice, and we encourage close \r\ncooperation and the use of best practices in setting up \r\nthe mechanism. In addition, we continue to believe that \r\nthe Security Council should refer the situation to the \r\nICC. However, in the absence of such a referral, which \r\nis, unfortunately, likely to be the case, States have other \r\noptions available to them. The finding of the Court’s \r\nPre-Trial Chamber that the Prosecutor can exercise \r\njurisdiction over the crime of the forced deportation \r\nof the Rohingya to Bangladesh opens a direct path to \r\njustice through a referral by States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute under article 14. We also welcome that fact that \r\nthe Security Council has been briefed on the findings of \r\nthe Fact-Finding Mission — a first small step in reversing \r\nthe denial of the reality in the Security Council.\r\nHuman rights defenders and civil society play \r\nan important and legitimate role in promoting and \r\nadvocating the realization of all human rights at the \r\nlocal, national, regional and international levels. They \r\nengage with Governments and contribute to efforts to \r\nimplement the obligations and commitments of States. \r\nWe are glad that the Liechtenstein National Human \r\nRights Institution, established in accordance with \r\nthe Paris Principles relating to the status of national \r\nhuman rights institutions, is now fully functional and \r\ncontributes to awareness-raising, public discourse and \r\nthe respect of human rights.\r\nWe are deeply concerned about the considerable \r\nincrease in the number of threats, acts of intimidation \r\nand harassment and attacks against individuals, \r\ngroups and associations that contribute to the effective \r\nelimination of all violations of the human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms of peoples and individuals. \r\nWe strongly condemn reprisals against human rights \r\ndefenders in retaliation for their engagement with \r\ninternational and regional human rights systems, and \r\nwe are deeply concerned about the increasing number \r\nof assaults against journalists, including their arbitrary \r\nimprisonment and killing. Promoting the safety of \r\njournalists and combating impunity for those who \r\nattack them must be a priority for each and every \r\nMember State and a central element of the work of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMs. Alsabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike at the outset to congratulate Ms. Michelle Bachelet \r\non her appointment as High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights, wishing her every success. We also pay tribute \r\nto her predecessor, Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, for \r\nhis work to promote human rights during his mandate.\r\nGiven the egregious violations of human rights \r\nresulting from the many bloody conflicts and disputes \r\nthat we are witnessing around the world, item 69 of \r\nthe agenda is a priority that requires close follow-up, \r\nin particular as we are commemorating the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights this year.\r\nThe State of Kuwait thanks the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for its important report (A/73/53 and A/73/53/\r\nAdd.1). We encourage constructive partnership and \r\ncooperation with a view to strengthening the promotion \r\nand maintenance of human rights and ensuring respect \r\nfor the choice of the principles and values that are in \r\nharmony with specific societies. At the same time, we \r\nreject any attempt to impose any cultures or principles \r\non peoples under the pretext of human rights, and we \r\ncall for the equality of all rights: political, economic, \r\nsocial, cultural and development-related. My country \r\nrecognizes the challenges and struggles facing the \r\ninternational community with regard to the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights in accordance with all \r\nrelevant international instruments and charters. We \r\nalso believe in the right of each person to development, \r\nemployment, food, medical care, education and \r\ngender equality, none of which will ever be realized in \r\nisolation from the achievement of international peace \r\nand security.\r\nAs part of its commitment to human rights, the \r\nState of Kuwait has created several relevant national \r\ninstitutions and mechanisms, including the National \r\nAnti-Corruption Authority, the Women’s Commission \r\nof the Council of Ministers, the Human Rights \r\nCommittee of the National Assembly, the National \r\nBureau for Human Rights, and the General Authority \r\nfor Disability Affairs, among others. I should also \r\nmention that the Kuwaiti Constitution provides for \r\nrespect for the dignity and rights of people. In that \r\nsame vein, we have endorsed a number of International \r\nLabour Organization conventions.\r\nThe State of Kuwait strongly condemns all \r\nviolations and abuses of human rights, as well as all \r\nviolations of international law by all parties to conflicts \r\nthroughout the world. We also strongly condemn attacks \r\nthat deliberately target civilians or promote child \r\nrecruitment, sexual and ethnic violence, murder and \r\nmutilation. We also condemn the targeting of houses, \r\nschools, hospitals, places of worship and infrastructure \r\nby any party to a conflict.\r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 15/29\r\nThe State of Kuwait stresses that all human \r\nrights are universal, indivisible and interrelated. That \r\nis why we reiterate our support for the promotion \r\nof international cooperation aimed at preventing \r\norganized acts of the looting and smuggling of cultural \r\nproperty and the illicit trafficking thereof. Given the \r\nforegoing, my country is a member of the Board of \r\nthe Foundation of the International Alliance for the \r\nProtection of Heritage in Conflict Areas. We commend \r\nthe Security Council resolution 2347 (2017) regarding \r\nthe preservation of cultural heritage in areas of armed \r\nconflict. We also pay tribute to the role played by the \r\nHuman Rights Council in its endeavours to protect and \r\npreserve cultural heritage.\r\nThe State of Kuwait is committed to implementing \r\nthe recommendations emanating from the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism, and is determined to \r\npromote cooperation with the Human Rights Council \r\nand its mechanisms. In that regard, we will receive \r\nthe Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with \r\ndisabilities by the end of November.\r\nThe State of Kuwait pays tribute to the Independent \r\nInternational Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar \r\nfor its report (A/HRC/39/64) and findings regarding \r\nthe violations committed there and commends the \r\nMission’s briefing to the Security Council last week \r\n(see S/PV.8381). That is an important step in the right \r\ndirection for accountability. We expect the Council to \r\nuphold its mandate in that regard.\r\nMy country strongly condemns the gross violations \r\ncommitted by the Israeli Defense Forces against the \r\nhuman rights of the Palestinian people, Israel’s defiance \r\nof the relevant Security Council resolutions and its \r\ncontinued occupation of the Palestinian territories. \r\nIn that regard, we welcome Human Rights Council \r\nresolution S-28/1, condemning violations committed \r\nby Israel against international law in the context of \r\nlarge-scale civilian protests in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem, and the Council’s \r\ncall for an international independent investigation.\r\nIn conclusion, my country is currently preparing \r\nour third national report within the framework of \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review mechanism in 2019. \r\nWe attach special importance to the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights, and we urge everyone \r\nto respect the principles contained in the relevant \r\ninternational instruments and charters. We call upon \r\nthe international community to join efforts to hold more \r\nconstructive discussions and promote cooperation with \r\none another.\r\nMr. Skoknic Tapia (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, my delegation thanks the President of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, Mr. Vojislav Šuc, for the \r\npresentation of the Council’s report (A/73/53 and \r\nA/73/53/Add.1), which gives us an accurate description \r\nof the vital work of the Council aimed at promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights around the world.\r\nChile recognizes the Human Rights Council as \r\nthe main body within the United Nations system for \r\ncooperation, dialogue and the building of consensus on \r\nthe fundamental pillar that human rights represents. We \r\nknow that consensus on important and sensitive issues \r\nis not easy to attain, even more so when multiple actors \r\nmeet within that body — from States to civil society and \r\nfrom international organizations to individuals — in the \r\nquest for common ground on which to build agreements \r\nthat allow for the protection of human beings and their \r\nrights around the world. That multiplicity, in any event, \r\nis also one of the Council’s greatest strengths.\r\nSince its inception in 2006, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has worked to promote and protect the rights \r\nof people throughout the world and sought to respond \r\nto and alleviate the needs of the victims of rights \r\nviolations and abuses. That work must be strengthened \r\nand promoted. Today more than ever, the work of the \r\nCouncil — including its decisions, special procedures \r\nand investigative mechanisms — must be respected by \r\nStates and protected by the international community, in \r\naccordance with our global goals for 2030. Furthermore, \r\nthose States whose human rights situations receive the \r\nattention of the Council and its procedures must be \r\nrespectful of the Council’s work and fully facilitate the \r\nimplementation of the decisions of that body.\r\nWe note with disappointment the humanitarian \r\nand human rights crises around the world, which are \r\nreflected in the hundreds of resolutions, decisions \r\nand special procedures of the Council at this year’s \r\nmeetings. The immense workload of the Council, which \r\nis an unfortunate correlate of the multiple crises, is a \r\nchallenge that must be addressed by the international \r\ncommunity, starting with the expert community in \r\nGeneva. In that city, which is home to comprehensive \r\ninternational protection mechanisms, the best ways to \r\nimprove the efficiency and effectiveness of the Council \r\nmust be discussed and analysed in a transparent and \r\ninclusive manner together with all the interested \r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n16/29 18-35714\r\nparties. That must include civil-society groups and the \r\nproposals that they submit.\r\nChile will participate and support the Council \r\nimprovement process, whether as one of the current \r\nVice-Presidents of that body or as a State interested \r\nin the progress of the international human rights \r\narchitecture. We thank the Government of Slovenia \r\nand the President of the Human Rights Council for \r\nthe opportunity to analyse in depth the path towards \r\nthe improvement of that body looking towards 2021, \r\nduring the Human Rights Council retreat in Ljubljana \r\nthat took place a few weeks ago. From that meeting, my \r\ncountry was able to conclude that, as 2021 approaches, \r\nthe Council will benefit by showing itself to be a strong, \r\nvibrant and essential body that is indispensable to the \r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nWe are convinced that it is our responsibility to \r\nstrengthen the Council, in the context of a community \r\nfacing global issues in need of global solutions. That \r\nresponsibility is particularly important in the framework \r\nof the celebration of the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The \r\nDeclaration is a guide that inspires us to continue \r\nworking to ensure that all people can achieve their \r\nfreedom, equality and dignity without any distinction, \r\nat all times and in all places.\r\nI should like to conclude by reiterating that my \r\ncountry will continue to work to ensure that the Human \r\nRights Council remains the competent multilateral \r\nauthority for the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights in the United Nations system.\r\nMs. Bavdaž Kuret (Slovenia): At the outset, let me \r\nsay that Slovenia fully aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the observer of the European Union. I would like \r\nto make additional comments in my national capacity.\r\nAt the end of this year, Slovenia will have completed \r\nits second term in the Human Rights Council. Let me \r\ntherefore use this opportunity for some of our reflections. \r\nHuman rights have been the cornerstone of Slovenian \r\nforeign policy since our independence in 1991. Through \r\nour experience in past years, we recognize human \r\nrights as one of the main fields where Slovenia can \r\nconstructively and progressively contribute to further \r\npositive developments in the wider international sphere. \r\nWe firmly believe that there is a strong interlinkage \r\nbetween peace and security, sustainable development \r\nand human rights. The first two cannot be achieved \r\nwithout stringent respect for the latter. Slovenia \r\nsupports the principles of the universality, indivisibility, \r\ninalienability and interdependence of human rights for \r\nall, irrespective of any personal circumstances.\r\nThe Human Rights Council is the principal body in \r\nthe United Nations system for dealing with all human \r\nrights issues. Slovenia has been actively engaged in the \r\nCouncil’s work since its creation in 2006. It has been \r\nan honour to serve a second term in that key global \r\nforum for human rights and fundamental freedoms for \r\nthe past three years, and we are looking forward to our \r\nnext membership. Until then we will remain a proactive \r\nobserver State.\r\nI wish to reiterate that Slovenia attaches great \r\nimportance to the work and mandate of the Council, \r\nwhich works well and has a good story to tell. It is truly \r\na much-needed voice for human dignity and human \r\nrights. Over the past decade the Council has brought \r\nabout immense progress in the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights around the world; however, it can and \r\nshould do more and better. Let us not forget that the \r\nCouncil bears the heavy responsibility of responding \r\neffectively to human rights challenges worldwide.\r\nMy country therefore firmly believes that we \r\nshould intensify our efforts to increase the Council’s \r\nability to implement the commitments that Member \r\nStates make in Geneva on the ground. With human \r\nrights challenges present around the globe today, it is \r\nof utmost importance to find new and innovative ways \r\nto translate the actions taken in room XX of the Palais \r\ndes Nations in Geneva to the ground. Let me remind \r\nthe Assembly of the important progress that we have \r\nachieved with the Universal Periodic Review, one of the \r\nmost treasured success stories of the United Nations, \r\nand we continue to work out how to achieve something \r\nsimilar with other mechanisms.\r\nDuring our term, we have listened carefully to \r\nthose who have expressed concerns about the work \r\nof the Council. As in any other United Nations body, \r\nthere is room for further improvement. We should \r\nstrive for a more systematic inclusion of the human \r\nrights dimension in conflict prevention and for closer \r\ncooperation between New York and Geneva. We look \r\nforward to fruitful discussions as we prepare for the next \r\nofficial review of the Human Rights Council in 2021. \r\nAs human rights remains one of the three fundamental \r\npillars of the United Nations, we should understand and \r\nuse the Human Rights Council accordingly.\r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 17/29\r\nWe believe in the Council’s ability to address its \r\nown challenges, and we wish to commend the current \r\nCouncil President, Ambassador Vojislav Šuc, for his \r\ndedication and efforts to build a more effective and \r\nefficient body. Slovenia strongly supports the ongoing \r\nwork of the Council’s Bureau aimed at increasing \r\nefficiency and improving methods of work. We believe \r\nthat the efforts of the current Bureau will lead to a more \r\nefficient, effective and therefore stronger Human Rights \r\nCouncil. Slovenia is ready to support the continuation \r\nof the ongoing efforts to enhance the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, increase its efficiency and improve its \r\nworking methods.\r\nAs the new High Commissioner for Human Rights, \r\nMs. Bachelet, said at the latest session of the Council,\r\n“[U]pholding human rights is in the interest of \r\nevery State. Your peoples seek a common agenda: \r\nrights, sustainable development and peace. We can \r\nonly progress towards that vision together. If we \r\nundermine multilateral institutions such as this \r\none, we will fail to meet the challenges that our \r\npeople face”.\r\nOn that basis, Slovenia will continue to engage in \r\nthe work of the Council in our future capacity as an \r\nobserver State. We will also engage constructively in \r\ndiscussions on how to improve the Council, its work \r\nand its impact on the ground in coming years.\r\nMr. Hassani Nejad Pirkouhi (Islamic Republic of \r\nIran): The Islamic Republic of Iran takes note of the \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council, as contained in \r\ndocument A/73/53 and A/73/53/Add.1. We also take note \r\nof the statement made by the President of the Human \r\nRights Council, Mr. Vojislav Šuc, and would like to \r\nthank him for his work as President of the Council.\r\nAt a time when racism, assaults on multilateralism, \r\nnationalist populism, extreme supremacist ideologies \r\nand bigotry show no sign of abating, Iran highlights \r\nthe work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nand her Office, within their respective mandates. In our \r\nview, the Office has yet to be fully utilized as a medium \r\nfor dialogue and cooperation. Regarding the work of \r\nthe Council, it is unfortunate that politicization and \r\nmanipulation have increased mistrust and eroded the \r\neffectiveness of the Council and its Universal Periodic \r\nReview mechanism. The initial idea behind the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism was to ensure universality, \r\nobjectivity, non-selectivity and impartiality in the work \r\nof the Council, as was also noted earlier by Mr. Šuc \r\nin his remarks. Regrettably, some countries still prefer \r\nto revert to the dysfunctional practice of submitting \r\ncountry-specific resolutions, which serve only to \r\nincrease confrontation in the Council.\r\nAs a product of the unconstructive initiatives \r\nundertaken by some countries, the report of the Council \r\nincludes a reference to resolution 37/30, which was \r\nadopted against my country. The resolution is one \r\nof those cases that exposes the shortcomings of the \r\nCouncil. It is nothing but a reflection of the short-sighted \r\npolitical interests of its sponsors, as well as a waste of \r\nlimited resources that could otherwise be utilized for the \r\nmeaningful promotion and protection of human rights. \r\nAccordingly, the Islamic Republic of Iran disassociates \r\nitself from that part of the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. At the same time, we reiterate our position \r\nof the non-recognition of and non-cooperation with \r\nthe mandates that have been created by the Council \r\noutside the sphere of internationally recognized human \r\nrights mechanisms.\r\nMy delegation recognizes the importance of \r\nstrengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of the \r\nCouncil within the framework of the institution-building \r\ntexts attached to Human Rights Council resolutions \r\n5/1 and 16/21. Within that framework, my delegation \r\nunderlines the importance of maintaining the current \r\nstructure of the Human Rights Council agenda, in \r\nparticular standing agenda item 7.\r\nWe welcome the idea of reducing the duration of \r\nthe Human Rights Council panel discussions from three \r\nto two hours. We also welcome the decision taken by \r\nconsensus in the Human Rights Council to hold the 2019 \r\npanel discussion on mainstreaming human rights under \r\nthe title “Human rights in the light of multilateralism: \r\nopportunities, challenges and the way forward”. The \r\ntitle could not be timelier.\r\nMeanwhile, my delegation views unfavourably the \r\nideas proposed in the framework of efforts to increase \r\nthe effectiveness of the Council that entail changes to \r\nthe structure of the Universal Periodic Review. They \r\ninclude a suggestion to dispense with the adoption of \r\nthe final outcome report of the Working Group on the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review. We also disagree with any \r\nreduction in the time allocated for a State’s right of reply. \r\nIn our view, any modification or decision concerning \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review has to be taken within \r\nthe framework of the existing institution-building \r\ndocuments and the relevant rules of procedure.\r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n18/29 18-35714\r\nAlso on the issue of the rationalization of Human \r\nRights Council resolutions, my delegation underscores \r\nthe importance of the institution-building package. \r\nFollow-up measures by the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights should also be \r\nconducted in a balanced, fair and equal manner.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation stresses the \r\nimportance of further cooperation and interaction \r\nbetween the Human Rights Council, the Third \r\nCommittee and the General Assembly with a view to \r\nimproving effectiveness and enhancing the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights in a cooperative and \r\ndialogue-based manner.\r\nMs. Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank Mr. Vojislav Šuc, President \r\nof the Human Rights Council, for his presentation of the \r\nCouncil’s report (A/73/53 and A/73/53/Add.1).\r\nI also take this opportunity to stress the importance \r\nof the mandate of the Human Rights Council, especially \r\ngiven the increasing challenges faced by our world today \r\nin terms of the rise in the number of armed conflicts, \r\nacts of terrorism, violent extremism and discrimination. \r\nThose challenges have caused suffering and poverty, in \r\naddition to unprecedented flows of migrants throughout \r\nthe world, with clear impacts on human rights at the \r\nsocial, economic, civil and cultural levels.\r\nThe State of Qatar has been implementing a policy \r\nof international cooperation whereby it can contribute \r\neffectively to international efforts to promote and \r\nprotect human rights, either by participating effectively \r\nin the relevant international agencies or by providing \r\nthe necessary resources to support the work of the \r\nUnited Nations bodies and mechanisms concerned with \r\nhuman rights and cooperate with them. For example, \r\nthe State of Qatar hosts the United Nations Human \r\nRights Training and Documentation Centre for South-\r\nWest Asia and the Arab Region. We have also adopted \r\nan open-door policy for receiving the mandate holders \r\nof the Council mechanisms.\r\nThrough its membership in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the State of Qatar is keen on participating \r\neffectively and cooperating constructively with other \r\nmember States so as to enable the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to uphold its mandate in the best way, guided \r\nby the principles of impartiality, objectivity and \r\nnon-selectivity. We continue to abide by our pledges \r\nand our effective contribution to Human Rights Council \r\nefforts aimed at strengthening respect for human rights \r\nand rapidly addressing human rights violations, as \r\nwell as strengthening accountability for human rights \r\nviolations and putting an end to impunity.\r\nThe wise leadership of the State of Qatar has great \r\ninterest in the promotion and protection of human rights. \r\nIt works tirelessly to build a State and a society where \r\nthe dignity and freedom of the people are protected. \r\nThat is in accordance with the Qatari Constitution and \r\nnational laws, which are in harmony with the relevant \r\ninternational conventions on human rights, including \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the \r\nseventieth anniversary of which we are commemorating \r\nthis year. We believe in the importance of the right to \r\ndevelopment. That is why we have mainstreamed that \r\nright in Qatar National Vision 2030 with regard to many \r\nobjectives related to human rights issues in human, \r\nsocial, economic and environmental development. That \r\nhas also been translated into our national development \r\nstrategies. At the same time, the State of Qatar is keen \r\non promoting national human rights institutions and \r\nprotecting the independence thereof. That includes the \r\nNational Human Rights Committee, which seeks to \r\nraise community awareness of human rights and the \r\nobligations of individuals, social justice and tolerance, \r\nstrengthening equality and non-discrimination, and \r\nending human rights violations.\r\nIn that context, I would like to mention that the \r\nNational Human Rights Committee has listed in \r\nvarious detailed reports, which have been corroborated \r\nstatistically, numerous human rights violations that \r\nwere the result of illegal and arbitrary unilateral \r\ncoercive measures that have been carried out against \r\nthe State of Qatar since June 2017. The reports also \r\nreveal the impacts of those violations in many vital \r\nareas on families, individuals and groups of people in \r\nthe State of Qatar and in the countries imposing that \r\nunjust embargo. Such measures contradict international \r\ncommitments to promoting and protecting human \r\nrights, and the international community must therefore \r\ncondemn and reject them.\r\nThe report of the Human Rights Council contains \r\nresolutions regarding the human rights situation in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory, which reflect the \r\ncontinued egregious violations of the human rights of \r\nthe Palestinian people. That people should be able to \r\nenjoy its inalienable rights, which are guaranteed under \r\ninternational law, international humanitarian law and \r\ninternational human rights law.\r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 19/29\r\nGiven the devastating impacts of the continuing \r\nSyrian crisis on the human rights of the brotherly Syrian \r\npeople, the Human Rights Council has responded \r\nwith a resolution addressing the dangerous conditions \r\nfacing civilians and the violation of their fundamental \r\nfreedoms. The international community should \r\ntherefore take urgent and effective steps commensurate \r\nwith such violations. The best way to put an end to those \r\nviolations is to reach a political solution to the crisis \r\nthrough Syrian negotiations under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the \r\ncommitment of the State of Qatar to the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. We will spare no effort to uphold \r\nour human rights commitments, and we will continue \r\nto support United Nations human rights mechanisms, \r\nwith the ultimate goal of promoting human rights for \r\nall humankind.\r\nMs. Shaheen (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I should like to congratulate the \r\nnewly elected members of the Human Rights Council. I \r\nalso congratulate those members who were re-elected to \r\nthe Council. We stress the importance of our country’s \r\ncommitment as a member of the Council to participate \r\neffectively and cooperate constructively in the area of \r\nprotecting and promoting human rights.\r\nWe listened to the statement made in the General \r\nAssembly today by the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We wish to assure the Assembly of our \r\ncommitment to uphold international humanitarian law \r\nand other commitments in that regard. The United \r\nArab Emirates regrets the lack of consensus within the \r\nHuman Rights Council regarding the crisis in Yemen.\r\nThis year, we commemorate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. It is an opportunity to reflect on the importance \r\nof that historic document, an importance that continues \r\nto grow over time, especially in the light of the \r\nchallenges that we currently face in terms of the human \r\nrights situations in various parts of the world. In that \r\nregard, I want to assure the Assembly of the steadfast \r\ncommitment of my country to human rights nationally, \r\nregionally and internationally, in keeping with our \r\nnational priorities and international commitments.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates stresses its commitment \r\nto continue working as a model for change in the \r\nregion and as an active member of the international \r\ncommunity. We shall continue to develop and advance \r\nour national standards with regard to human rights and \r\nto bring them into line with international standards, in \r\naddition to strengthening and developing our various \r\nhuman rights mechanisms and institutions. We are \r\nalso determined to step up cooperation with United \r\nNations human rights bodies and mechanisms and to \r\nprovide them with the necessary support so that they \r\ncan carry out their tasks and activities, including the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review mechanism of the Human \r\nRights Council. We consider it an important and \r\nconstructive mechanism for exchanging experience and \r\nbest practices among Member States so as to ensure the \r\nrealization of human rights.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates submitted its third \r\nperiodic review to the Human Rights Council in January. \r\nWe underscored the efforts we have undertaken over the \r\npast four and a half years, including the developments \r\nwithin our legislative and legal framework, as well as \r\nthe strengthening of national human rights mechanisms \r\nand best practices to protect and promote human rights. \r\nMy delegation also reported to the Council on the second \r\nperiodic review recommendations that we have accepted \r\nand implemented. That review was broadly welcomed \r\nby member States and by a number of non-governmental \r\norganizations, reflecting the spirit of constructive \r\npartnership with all relevant bodies and institutions. \r\nFurthermore, my country is preparing to develop a \r\nnational plan to follow up on the implementation of \r\nthe recommendations that we accepted under the third \r\nperiodic review of human rights.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is working constantly \r\nto improve its human rights record. We strive to \r\ninteract positively with international practices in that \r\nregard. As for strengthening our national human rights \r\nmechanisms, we have taken the necessary steps to \r\nestablish a national human rights institution, in line \r\nwith the Paris Principles on such bodies. We have \r\nalready carried out a review of the draft law creating \r\nthat institution, which will be adopted in the near future.\r\nWe have also made important achievements in terms \r\nof promoting and developing our national legislation, \r\npolicies and strategies concerning the empowerment of \r\nwomen, gender equality, the empowerment of young and \r\ndisabled people, the protection of children, combating \r\ncrimes related to human trafficking, strengthening \r\nlaws regarding the rights of employees working for \r\nthe Government, as well as promoting tolerance and \r\neliminating all forms of racial discrimination through \r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n20/29 18-35714\r\nthe national tolerance programme. My country recently \r\nlaunched its national policy for the elderly aimed at \r\nimproving their quality of life and at ensuring their \r\neffective and continuous participation in our national \r\nsocial fabric. Those efforts have put our country in \r\nan advanced position on the human development and \r\nuniversal happiness indices, in addition to the rule of \r\nlaw and competitiveness.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is committed to \r\nupholding our international human rights commitments \r\nand cooperating with the relevant international \r\nmechanisms for the protection and promotion of human \r\nrights. In that regard, we submitted to the relevant \r\ncommittee our first report in June under the United \r\nNations Convention against Torture. We are awaiting \r\nthe setting of a date to review that report.\r\nAs part of strengthening cooperation and dialogue \r\nwith other United Nations mechanisms of the Human \r\nRights Council, the United Arab Emirates has extended \r\ninvitations to the Special Rapporteur on the rights of \r\npersons with disabilities and the Special Rapporteur \r\non the right to education to visit our country for an \r\nexchange of experience and best practices in the \r\narea of empowering individuals with disabilities and \r\nstrengthening the right to education.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to underscore that the United \r\nArab Emirates has made tremendous headway in terms of \r\nhuman rights in a short period of time. We shall continue \r\nto undertake assiduous efforts to constructively and \r\nsystematically enhance the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nMs. Kipiani (Georgia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nfor his comprehensive report (A/73/53 and A/73/53/\r\nAdd.1) and for his efforts and dedication to fulfilling \r\nthe mandate of the Council.\r\nThe current human rights situation is deeply \r\nworrying, with violence, discrimination and inequality \r\naffecting the lives of people in all corners of the globe. \r\nSince its establishment, the Human Rights Council has \r\nserved as the backbone of our human rights commitments. \r\nThe recommendations of the Council, special-procedure \r\nmandate holders, the Universal Periodic Review process \r\nand the technical assistance provided by the Office of \r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), \r\ntogether with other human rights mechanisms of the \r\nUnited Nations machinery, represent important tools \r\nfor addressing human rights issues. Nevertheless, much \r\nmore needs to be done to realize the full potential of \r\nthis institution. In that respect, I should like to take \r\nthis opportunity once again to express gratitude to \r\nPresident Vojislav Šuc for his tireless efforts to increase \r\nthe efficiency of the work of the Council on both the \r\nsubstantive and the technical levels.\r\nWhen discussing the human rights machinery, \r\none must not underestimate the importance of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review process. Georgia deems \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review a unique human \r\nrights mechanism that enables States to better assess \r\ndevelopments and implement the policies necessary to \r\nimprove and advance human rights. We believe that the \r\nlegislative branch of Governments must necessarily \r\nplay an important role in implementing United \r\nNations human rights recommendations, since they \r\nmay require new or amended legislation and, in some \r\ncases, national budget appropriations. Parliaments can \r\nalso play an important role in overseeing Government \r\nimplementation and compliance with international \r\nhuman rights recommendations. We also welcome the \r\nwider engagement of non-governmental organizations \r\n(NGOs) and national human rights institutions. As for \r\nthe recommendations received by Georgia during the \r\nsecond review cycle, they are being translated into the \r\nGovernment’s Action Plan for Human Rights 2018-\r\n2020, which is based on our comprehensive long-term \r\nhuman rights strategy.\r\nGeorgia supports the strengthening of the Council’s \r\ndelivery of technical assistance and capacity-building \r\nsupport under its agenda item 10, in consultation with \r\nand with the consent of the Member States concerned. \r\nOnce again, the active participation of civil-society \r\nactors in the work of the Human Rights Council and \r\nits mechanisms is instrumental. We underline the \r\nimportance of strengthening the role of NGOs and of \r\nsafeguarding the space for civil society so as to ensure \r\nthat their voices are heard. Without close cooperation \r\nwith all stakeholders, it is impossible to secure \r\nsustainable development based on democratic values, \r\nthe rule of law and human rights.\r\nGeorgia joins the calls of the international \r\ncommunity for an immediate end to reprisals against \r\nhuman rights defenders. There is an urgent need for \r\nall States to take necessary measures to prevent such \r\nintimidation and reprisals and to take appropriate \r\naction to provide remedies for all acts of intimidation \r\nand reprisals.\r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 21/29\r\nGeorgia attaches particular importance to the \r\nissue of the implementation of the treaty obligations \r\nand human rights recommendations emanating from \r\nthe United Nations human rights system. At the \r\nnational level, Georgia has established an institution \r\nmandated to track and coordinate the national follow-\r\nup to and implementation of such obligations and \r\nrecommendations. We recommend that Member \r\nStates continue efforts aimed at the establishment \r\nand/or strengthening of national mechanisms, with \r\ncivil-society participation, that are responsible for the \r\ncoordination of the implementation of, reporting on \r\nand follow-up to the human rights recommendations \r\ngenerated by the main United Nations human rights \r\nmechanisms and the relevant regional mechanisms.\r\nI would like to stress Georgia’s full support for the \r\nspecial procedures, which represent another effective \r\ntool for addressing country-specific and thematic \r\nsituations. Georgia has extended a standing invitation \r\nto all special-procedure mandate holders and has \r\nalready hosted several visits by them, including the \r\nIndependent Expert on protection against violence and \r\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender \r\nidentity, who visited Georgia few weeks ago.\r\nDuring the reporting year, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has adopted various significant thematic and \r\ncountry-specific resolutions. In that regard, let me \r\nunderline Human Rights Council resolution 37/40, \r\nentitled “Cooperation with Georgia”, which calls for \r\nimmediate access for OHCHR and other international \r\nand regional human rights mechanisms to the occupied \r\nregions of Georgia. We believe that OHCHR’s strong \r\nleadership and engagement on the matter will prevent \r\nany further deterioration of the situation on the ground.\r\nIn conclusion, let me underline Georgia’s readiness \r\nto join the international community in strengthening \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights across \r\nthe world.\r\nMr. Lal (India): We welcome the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, Ambassador Vojislav Šuc, to \r\nthis meeting and thank him for his informative briefing.\r\nOne month from now, we will celebrate the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, the guiding text \r\nunderlying our collective efforts to promote and protect \r\nthe human rights of all.\r\nSince its establishment 12 years ago, the Human \r\nRights Council, as an intergovernmental subsidiary \r\nbody of the General Assembly, has sought to overcome \r\nthe problems that its predecessor faced. The work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and its associated procedures \r\nand mandates is, regrettably, getting more contentious \r\nand difficult. More broadly, the global situation today \r\nis troubling, with concern growing over the multiple \r\nchallenges posed to the spirit of multilateralism owing \r\nto the ineffectiveness of global governance mechanisms \r\nin finding commonly acceptable solutions. The reasons \r\nfor many of the difficulties relating to the human rights \r\nagenda flow from the often very divergent priorities and \r\nconcerns of Member States as a result of their differing \r\nlevels of development, social and cultural contexts, and \r\ngovernance systems.\r\nWhile the global discourse on human rights \r\ncontinues to evolve, fundamental contradictions remain. \r\nThe relative prioritization of the individual versus the \r\nState, national sovereignty versus international norms, \r\nand a universal versus a culture-specific approach all \r\nevoke differing opinions. Instances of the politicization \r\nof human rights as a foreign policy tool and perceived \r\nintrusiveness beyond mandated activities remain areas \r\nof concern.\r\nTerrorism has emerged as one of the worst forms \r\nof the violation of human rights. My country has had \r\nto face repeated terrorist attacks on innocent people, \r\nwhich have originated beyond our borders. Despite \r\nterrorism being acknowledged as one of the foremost \r\nglobal challenges, any meaningful collective response \r\nto address that menace continues to be thwarted by \r\nsome. We will soon also have to consider the varied \r\nand uneven impact of emerging technologies — from \r\ncyberengineering to genetic engineering and artificial \r\nintelligence — on peoples’ lives and rights.\r\nThe work of the Human Rights Council continues \r\nto expand. The effectiveness of its work is, however, \r\nnot always clear. There is also a proliferation of special \r\nprocedures on both thematic and country-specific \r\nsituations. Instances of such mechanisms and officials \r\noperating on their own without any mandate and \r\nproducing clearly biased documents only further harm \r\nthe credibility of the United Nations.\r\nIn contrast, the Universal Periodic Review \r\nmechanism has seen significant success over the 12 years \r\nof the work of the Human Rights Council. All Member \r\nStates have presented their Universal Periodic Review \r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n22/29 18-35714\r\nat least once. India has presented its Universal Periodic \r\nReview in each of the three cycles. A large number \r\nof specific recommendations have been implemented \r\nby a number of Member States, including India. The \r\nconcrete success of the Universal Periodic Review and \r\nthe voluntary national review mechanisms in New York \r\nis due to their constructive and participatory nature, \r\nas opposed to the selective “naming-and-shaming” \r\napproach that has often been resorted to.\r\nAs an ancient civilization of immense diversity and \r\nthe world’s largest democracy today, India has abiding \r\nfaith in the spirit of multilateralism. India’s approach \r\nto human rights continues to evolve as more rights \r\nbecome justiciable and the process of the progressive \r\ninterpretation of laws by our judiciary evolves.\r\nAs an elected member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the term beginning next year, we remain \r\ncommitted to bringing a pluralistic, moderate and \r\nbalanced perspective aimed at trying to bridge multiple \r\ndivides. The human rights agenda must be pursued in a \r\nfair and equal manner with objectivity, non-selectivity \r\nand transparency. For the success of our collective and \r\ncommon cause of promoting and protecting human \r\nrights our approach should not be confrontational but \r\nshould instead focus on a more inclusive, participatory \r\nand positive approach through dialogue and capacity-\r\nbuilding.\r\nMr. Jaime Calderón (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, I should like to recognize the \r\nwork of the President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nMr. Vojislav Šuc of Slovenia, throughout the year 2018. \r\nHaving presided over the Council in 2017, El Salvador \r\nrecognizes the importance of the contributions and \r\nperspectives of small countries when it comes to the \r\nuniversal promotion and protection of human rights \r\nand the need to uphold the essential role of the Human \r\nRights Council as a central part of the human rights \r\npillar of United Nations activity.\r\nWe would like to make some comments on the \r\nreport contained in documents A/73/53 and A/73/53/\r\nAdd.1.\r\nFirst, El Salvador welcomes the diverse range of \r\nthemes addressed in the Council’s three sessions this \r\npast year, as well as the many successfully concluded \r\nUniversal Periodic Reviews. However, while we note \r\nthat the Council adopted many specific resolutions, we \r\nalso recognize a high level of duplication between the \r\nCouncil’s agenda and resolutions and those of the Third \r\nCommittee of the General Assembly. We therefore \r\nreiterate our call on their respective future presiding \r\nofficers to plan their work jointly so as to ensure that the \r\nCouncil, a subsidiary body of the General Assembly, \r\nand the Third Committee of the Assembly carry out \r\ncomplementary activities without duplication.\r\nThe adoption by the Human Rights Council of \r\nmore than 10 resolutions on country-specific situations \r\nprovides a clear example of such duplication. El \r\nSalvador is of the opinion that the Council is, in fact, the \r\nmost appropriate body to discuss such matters, which, \r\ntogether with the Universal Periodic Review, represent \r\nuseful monitoring mechanisms for all Member States, \r\nand we therefore believe that the introduction of specific \r\ndraft resolutions in the Third Committee is redundant.\r\nMy delegation wishes to highlight Council \r\nresolutions 37/7, 37/24 and 37/25, on the links between \r\nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the universal promotion and protection \r\nof civil, political, social, economic and human rights. \r\nEl Salvador takes a holistic view of development and \r\nconsiders fundamentally artificial any perspective that \r\ndisconnects efforts on the ground to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment from the promotion of human rights. The \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals \r\ngoes hand in hand with the application of the various \r\nconventions and covenants on human rights. El Salvador \r\ntherefore welcomes the decisions taken in paragraphs 1, \r\n2 and 7 of Council resolution 37/24, whereby the Human \r\nRights Council will hold discussions on communicating \r\nits perspective to the High-level Political Forum on \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nEl Salvador is a member of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and will present the second edition of its \r\nVoluntary National Review to the High-level Political \r\nForum in July 2019. We will work together with all \r\nMember States to ensure that those inputs are used and \r\ntaken into account. It is necessary to point out, however, \r\nthat that approach should be part of a wider conversation \r\nunder the leadership of the President of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, in which we can learn from that \r\nexercise, as well as those of previous years, and seek \r\nto take better advantage of the Forum, not by simply \r\ntaking note but rather by truly making use of the diverse \r\ninputs provided by the various specialized bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations system.\r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 23/29\r\nWith regard to the specific question of \r\nimplementation modalities and in relation to the content \r\nof Human Rights Council resolution 37/25, we wish to \r\nmake it clear that El Salvador’s position remains that \r\nwe should use the channels established by the follow-\r\nup processes of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the \r\nSecond Committee and the High-level Political Forum \r\nas channels for discussing Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 17 and other topics relating to implementation \r\nmechanisms in the context of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nEl Salvador welcomes Council resolutions 38/4, \r\nentitled “Human rights and climate change”, and \r\n38/10, entitled “Human rights and the regulation of \r\ncivilian acquisition, possession and use of firearms”. \r\nBoth resolutions are clear examples of the linkages \r\nbetween the human rights, sustainable development \r\nand peace and security agendas, which should be \r\nviewed holistically from the perspective of prevention \r\nin accordance with the recent reform efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General and the vision of sustainable peace, \r\nwhich my Government supports.\r\nWe would also like to highlight, although it is not \r\na resolution, the joint declaration on unaccompanied \r\nmigrant children and adolescents, presented by El \r\nSalvador at the thirty-ninth session of the Council in \r\nSeptember 2018, which was supported by a large number \r\nof countries. Upholding human rights throughout the \r\nmigratory cycle, especially in the case of boys, girls and \r\nadolescents, is of the greatest importance to my country, \r\nand we highlight the inclusion of that perspective in \r\nCouncil resolutions 37/13, 37/18, 37/20, 38/4, 38/6, 38/8, \r\n38/9, 38/12, 38/19, 39/12 and 39/17.\r\nIn conclusion, El Salvador wishes once again to \r\nexpress its full support for the work of the Human \r\nRights Council and the adoption of its report, in its \r\nentirety, by the General Assembly. We are aware of the \r\nneed to continually improve the work of the Council \r\nand of the need for States, civil society, the media and \r\nour citizens to remain vigilant so as to ensure that the \r\nHuman Rights Council not make the same mistakes as \r\nits predecessor. We congratulate all those States elected \r\nas new members of the Human Rights Council for the \r\nterm 2019-2022, and we are certain that they will, \r\nin fulfilling their duties, rise to meet current global \r\nexpectations for greater consensus and progress, with \r\nno room for backsliding, in promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights for all.\r\nMr. Favre (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland thanks the President of the Human \r\nRights Council for his statement and commends his \r\ncommitment. We are proud of the work achieved by the \r\nHuman Rights Council under his presidency.\r\nOver the past year, the Council has responded to \r\nemerging situations and renewed important mandates. \r\nOur country welcomes the Council’s efforts to improve \r\nthe impact of its work on the ground. We encourage \r\nit strongly to continue developing monitoring and \r\nfollow-up instruments aimed at ensuring the effective \r\nimplementation by States of the recommendations \r\nissued by treaty bodies, special procedures and the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review. We call on all countries to \r\nsupport that crucial approach.\r\nAt the same time, we fully support the efforts of \r\nthe Council’s President to strengthen that body, in \r\nparticular by improving the efficiency of its functioning \r\nand increasing its visibility within the United Nations \r\nsystem. Switzerland welcomes the President’s \r\ndetermination to address the challenges relating to \r\nresource shortfalls. In that respect, it is crucial that \r\nconsideration be given to how to optimize its working \r\nmethods. Pursuing certain initiatives on a two-year \r\ntimeline seems to be a potentially fruitful approach in \r\nthat context.\r\nSwitzerland continues to believe that human rights \r\nwill be respected, protected and promoted only if they \r\nare fully integrated into the United Nations global \r\nagenda. Switzerland supports the reforms being carried \r\nout by the Secretary-General. The question of the place \r\nof human rights in a reformed United Nations was the \r\nsubject of the fifth Glion Human Rights Dialogue. \r\nThe Dialogue highlighted, in particular, the need for \r\ncoordinated action across the three pillars of the United \r\nNations in order to fully achieve the Secretary-General’s \r\nobjectives, given the close interrelationship that exists \r\nbetween them. The discussions also highlighted the \r\nimportance of efforts to reduce the gap between Geneva \r\nand New York. In that regard, Switzerland notes that the \r\ndiscussions and deliberations held in Geneva seem to \r\nhave little resonance with the New York bodies.\r\nIn the light of that situation, Switzerland launched the \r\n13 June appeal on the occasion of the tenth anniversary \r\nof the Human Rights Council, in 2016. That initiative \r\nseeks to place human rights at the heart of conflict \r\nprevention. Switzerland calls on all Member States \r\nto join the 71 countries that have already supported \r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n24/29 18-35714\r\nthat appeal and to commit to implementing it. The \r\nappeal calls, inter alia, for stepping up the exchange of \r\ninformation between the Human Rights Council and the \r\nSecurity Council. The President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil also has a central role to play in ensuring that \r\ninformation is exchanged more systematically.\r\nIn conclusion, Switzerland underscores once \r\nagain the importance of civil society when it comes \r\nto respecting, protecting and promoting human \r\nrights. We recall that civil-society activities form an \r\nindispensable complement to the work of the Human \r\nRights Council. In that context, Switzerland is alarmed \r\nby the intimidation and reprisals faced by civil-society \r\nactors working to uphold human rights. Switzerland \r\nurges States to take all necessary measures to eliminate \r\nsuch unacceptable practices.\r\nMr. Carazo Zeledón (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We appreciate the report on the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council during its thirty-seventh \r\nand thirty-eighth sessions and its twenty-seventh \r\nand twenty-eighth special sessions (A/73/53 and \r\nA/73/53/Add.1), and we thank the Council’s President, \r\nAmbassador Vojislav Šuc, for his presentation.\r\nCosta Rica reaffirms its commitment to human rights \r\nas being universal, indivisible and interdependent. All \r\nof us enjoy fundamental rights, which are common to \r\nall societies and cultural traditions and are based on the \r\nintrinsic dignity of each person at all times everywhere. \r\nThat concept lies at the heart of the United Nations \r\nhuman rights system. That is why we reiterate with \r\nconviction our support for the work of the Council and \r\nits role as the leading intergovernmental body charged \r\nwith promoting universal respect for the protection \r\nof the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all \r\npeople, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and \r\nequitable manner, guided by impartiality, objectivity, \r\nnon-selectivity, dialogue and cooperation.\r\nWe must ensure that the work of the Human \r\nRights Council is inspired by and focused on giving \r\nvoice to all people, especially the most vulnerable and \r\nmarginalized, which includes denouncing barbarities, \r\nfighting all forms of discrimination and violence, and \r\nmaking progress towards reducing inequality. We \r\nwelcome the institutional strengthening of the Council \r\nand especially the Universal Periodic Review, a unique \r\nprocess that places all States on an equal footing in \r\nanalysing their human rights situations based on the \r\nprinciples of cooperation and constructive international \r\ndialogue, and allows not only for the review of \r\ncountries’ compliance with their obligations but also \r\nfor the improvement of the practices and approaches in \r\nall countries.\r\nWe firmly believe that there should be a relationship \r\nof equality, and not of asymmetry, between the Council \r\nand the main bodies of the United Nations. Efforts to \r\nstrengthen the Council and improve its functioning, in \r\nclear and close coordination with other mechanisms \r\nof the human rights system, such as treaty bodies, and \r\nwith other components of the United Nations system, \r\nin particular the Third Committee of the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council, are essential. \r\nBetter articulation among all the bodies would have a \r\ndirect impact on the promotion and protection of all \r\nhuman rights and thereby ensure a better quality of life \r\nfor everyone.\r\nGiven the exponential growth in the Council’s \r\nworkload to an unsustainable level and the fragmentation \r\nof topics, we welcome the efforts to rationalize the \r\nworking methods of the Council, including seeking \r\nlong-term solutions so as to improve its effectiveness \r\nand efficiency, which include measures to improve the \r\nannual work programme, streamline the number of \r\nresolutions and initiatives, consider certain resolutions \r\nevery two years instead of annually, avoid duplication \r\nof effort, consolidate resolutions on related topics, \r\nand make maximum use of modern technology. We \r\nare grateful for the briefings held on those efforts by \r\nthe President of the Council throughout the year with \r\na view to maintaining constant coordination between \r\nNew York and Geneva, and we hope that the upcoming \r\nmonth of December will see the adoption of a package \r\nof measures aimed at helping to strengthen the \r\nCouncil’s work.\r\nAlthough not currently a member of the Council, \r\nCosta Rica has striven to cooperate with the Council \r\nin its work. In that regard, we have supported various \r\ninitiatives, including one seeking to protect human rights \r\nin the context of peaceful protest, which was adopted by \r\nconsensus. We also worked on the resolution on human \r\nrights education, which establishes a new human rights \r\ntraining programme at the global level under the Office \r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights. We \r\nascribe particular importance to the emphasis on human \r\nrights training in the light of the worldwide tendency to \r\ndehumanize and discriminate against certain groups, \r\nsuch as migrants, refugees and minorities among \r\nothers. We must return to the very foundations of the \r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 25/29\r\ninternational community, starting with article 1 of the \r\nUniversal Declaration, which recognizes that all human \r\nbeings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\r\nWe welcome the adoption of Council resolution \r\n37/8, entitled “Human rights and the environment”, \r\nrenewing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on \r\nthat topic and giving him the mandate to brief the \r\nThird Committee. Costa Rica stands ready to support \r\nthe Special Rapporteur and, in particular, to contribute \r\nto defining a road map leading to the recognition \r\nof the right to a healthy and stable environment as a \r\nfundamental human right to be enjoyed by all and \r\nleaving no one behind.\r\nWe also draw attention to the adoption at the \r\nmost recent session, which ended on 1 October, of \r\nresolution 39/1, entitled “Promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela”, \r\nwhich was submitted by 11 countries, including Costa \r\nRica, and sponsored by more than 42 countries. That \r\nresolution, adopted for the first time, reiterates the \r\nprimary responsibility of all States to promote and \r\nprotect the human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nof their citizens and to comply with their obligations \r\nunder international human rights law. The resolution \r\ncalls on the Venezuelan Government to accept \r\nhumanitarian assistance aimed at mitigating shortages \r\nin foods and medicines, the increase in the number of \r\ncases of malnutrition and the outbreak of previously \r\neradicated diseases.\r\nBased on our unwavering commitment to human \r\nrights, we will continue to work and collaborate \r\nconstructively for a Human Rights Council that is \r\neffective, transparency, robust and responsive.\r\nMr. Moraru (Republic of Moldova): The Republic \r\nof Moldova welcomes the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil (A/73/53 and A/73/53/Add.1) presented by the \r\nPresident of the Council, Ambassador Mr. Vojislav Šuc. \r\nWe appreciate Ambassador Šuc’s dedicated work as the \r\nPresident of the Council and wish to express our full \r\nsupport to him.\r\nSeventy-three years ago, the Charter of the United \r\nNations established human rights as one of the three \r\nfundamental pillars of the United Nations system \r\nalongside peace and security and development. The \r\nHuman Rights Council is, therefore, a central body \r\nof this Organization, serving as a platform for the \r\npromotion of human rights worldwide and keeping \r\na constant watchful eye on the world’s most pressing \r\nhuman rights challenges.\r\nThe variety of issues contained in the Council’s \r\nreport this year attests to the intensity of the work of the \r\nUnited Nations system in the area of human rights and \r\nthe ever-expanding list of issues that require the utmost \r\nattention of the international community. This year, \r\nwe mark the seventieth anniversary of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the Declaration on Human Rights \r\nDefenders, and the States Members of the United Nations \r\nshould therefore maintain their support for and continue \r\ntheir engagement with the Human Rights Council with \r\nthe view to promoting the fundamental principles and \r\ncommitments contained in those Declarations.\r\nWhile no country in the world can claim to have a \r\nperfect human rights record, the Republic of Moldova \r\nshares the belief that imperfections and deficiencies \r\nshould not be concealed or swept aside. We very often \r\nhear, and many States agree, that human rights are \r\nuniversal, inalienable, interrelated, interdependent and \r\nindivisible. But as repetitive as it may sound, that is \r\nnot a hollow affirmation. They are the principles that \r\nencompass the essence of human rights and the way in \r\nwhich the United Nations should approach them.\r\nThere can be divergences of opinion that are \r\nbased on various political or cultural peculiarities. \r\nHowever, engaging in dialogue and embracing the \r\nhuman rights system that Member States themselves \r\nhave created is far more productive and beneficial, both \r\nfor multilateralism and for human rights protection, \r\nthan simply rebuffing it. In that respect, we reaffirm \r\nthe importance of granting the unimpeded access of \r\nmandate holders to countries, institutions, individuals \r\nand civil society with a view to ensuring the fulfilment \r\nof the Human Rights Council’s primary role in efforts \r\nto ensure accountability and improve the human rights \r\nsituation worldwide.\r\nWe are concerned that, despite the intricate United \r\nNations system in place, human rights violations and \r\nabuses continue, in many cases with impunity, the \r\nmost disconcerting being the continuing reprisals \r\nagainst human rights defenders, the countless \r\ninnocent victims, including children, fallen in wars or \r\nsubjected to tremendous suffering, and the continuing \r\nsubjugation of entire populations to misinformation or \r\nmanipulation through the control of the media or other \r\nmeans for strategic purposes that are incompatible with \r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n26/29 18-35714\r\ninternational law. The list certainly does not end there. \r\nThose are unacceptable acts, and Member States have \r\nthe moral and legal responsibility to protect everyone \r\nfrom harm and persecution. The Human Rights Council \r\nhas the responsibility to remain alert and respond \r\nswiftly to such undesirable situations.\r\nMoreover, it has been stated many times that \r\nhuman rights violations are often the precursors of \r\nconflicts. Therefore, while the persistent pointing out \r\nof such human rights violations may often appear \r\nto be a cause of irritation to Member States, in fact \r\naddressing those violations in good faith and building \r\ninstitutions for human rights protection could be the \r\nvery solution needed to ensure prosperous and stable \r\nsocieties and to prevent conflicts. In that regard, the \r\nHuman Rights Council is the necessary platform for \r\ndialogue among Governments and with civil society \r\nin order to ensure that violations and grievances are \r\ntalked through and solutions found in a constructive \r\nand non-politicized manner.\r\nSince the establishment of the Council in 2006, \r\nthe Republic of Moldova has adopted a cooperative \r\napproach towards its mechanisms and has issued a \r\nstanding invitation to all thematic special procedures. \r\nThe Moldovan Government remains ready to honour that \r\nstanding invitation; many rapporteurs have visited our \r\ncountry in the past, and we remain open to cooperating \r\nwith full transparency and diligence in the future.\r\nOur third National Action Plan on Human Rights, \r\nfor 2018-2022, adopted this year, incorporates the \r\nrecommendations of United Nations monitoring bodies \r\nand other relevant regional organizations, resulting \r\nin a comprehensive road map that the Government is \r\nfully committed to pursuing. Moreover, that National \r\nAction Plan reflects most of the recommendations from \r\nMoldova’s second Universal Periodic Review, which \r\ntook place in November 2016.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova reaffirms its support for \r\nthe effective and efficient functioning of the Human \r\nRights Council and will continue to support initiatives \r\naimed at strengthening it further, including efforts \r\nseeking to improve the Council’s working methods. \r\nOnly by remaining fit for purpose will the Council \r\nretain its relevance.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova has put forward its \r\ncandidature for the Human Rights Council term 2020-\r\n2022 at the elections to be held in 2019. As a country \r\nthat has already served on the Council and gone through \r\nprofound societal transformations, the Republic of \r\nMoldova wishes to bring to the work of the Council our \r\nunique perspective on efforts to promote human rights, \r\nin particular in societies emerging from conflict or \r\nin transition.\r\nIn closing, I would like to welcome both the \r\nappointment by the Secretary-General of Ms. Michelle \r\nBachelet as United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights and her recent first engagement with \r\nthe Members of the General Assembly in the Third \r\nCommittee. The support that her Office provides to the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council is instrumental to its \r\neffective functioning, and we express our openness to \r\ncooperating with the High Commissioner in fulfilling \r\nher very important mandate.\r\nMs. Wessel (Norway): Norway thanks the President \r\nof the Human Rights Council for his presentation of \r\nthe report of the Council (A/73/53 and A/73/53/Add.1). \r\nThe report invites us to reflect on the functioning of \r\nthat body.\r\nOver the past year, we took important decisions in \r\nGeneva. Norway is particularly pleased that the new \r\ninitiative on the contribution of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to the prevention of human rights violations \r\nwas adopted in July with strong cross-regional support. \r\nIn our view, preventing human rights violations is \r\nparamount as we seek to promote peace, stability \r\nand development.\r\nThe twentieth anniversary of the Declaration on \r\nHuman Rights Defenders provides us with an important \r\nopportunity to celebrate the bravery of all human rights \r\ndefenders and to take collective action to enhance their \r\nprotection. The High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nhighlighted, during the World Human Rights Defenders \r\nSummit in Paris this week, that human rights defenders \r\nare a key asset in enhancing the preventive work of the \r\nUnited Nations, as their reports provide early warning \r\nof impending crises, help us to understand the root \r\ncauses of conflict and contribute to work aimed at \r\nresolving and preventing outbreaks thereof. Norway \r\nis looking forward to celebrating the Declaration on \r\nHuman Rights Defenders during the high-level plenary \r\nmeeting dedicated to that topic to be held in New York \r\nin December.\r\nNorway thinks that it is important to keep in mind \r\nthe strengths of the Human Rights Council, especially \r\nnow when we are discussing efficiency measures. We \r\nshould focus on what works well, but at the same time \r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 27/29\r\nfind common ground on how we can strengthen the \r\nwork of the Council. We firmly believe that we can reach \r\nconsensus through dialogue and cooperation. We take \r\nthis opportunity to thank the President of the Human \r\nRights Council, Ambassador Šuc, for his professional \r\nand transparent leadership of the discussions in Geneva, \r\nand we will continue to support that process.\r\nDuring 2018, the Human Rights Council \r\ndemonstrated that it has strong tools in its toolbox \r\nand that members of the Council are not shying away \r\nfrom using them. We welcome the fact that some of the \r\nreports mandated in Human Rights Council resolutions \r\nhave also been presented to the Security Council \r\nwhen relevant.\r\nAs a consistent partner and friend of an independent \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, \r\nNorway recently signed a four-year financial support \r\nagreement with the High Commissioner’s Office. We \r\nbelieve that predictability and strategic planning are \r\nessential when working to support the Office’s efforts \r\nto promote and protect human rights for all.\r\nAt a time when human rights are being violated \r\nand contested, we must strengthen the human rights \r\npillar of the United Nations and the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We are more likely \r\nto achieve sustainable development and security when \r\nhuman rights are respected.\r\nMr. Suan (Myanmar): I would like to congratulate \r\nthe President of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador \r\nVojislav Šuc, for his hard work and able leadership.\r\nThe report of the Human Rights Council and its \r\naddendum (A/73/53 and A/73/53/Add.1), submitted \r\nunder agenda item 69, contains three resolutions \r\nrelating to Myanmar. None of those resolutions enjoyed \r\nconsensus during their adoption at the respective \r\nsession. Myanmar has categorically rejected the three \r\nresolutions because they are politically motivated, \r\nintrusive and sovereignty-infringing. They also lack \r\nimpartiality and objectivity. One sponsor of one of those \r\nresolutions even stated in its explanation of vote before \r\nthe voting in the Council that the establishment of the \r\nindependent mechanism did not fall within the mandate \r\nof the Council as stipulated in the institution-building \r\npackage and that, in deciding to establish that \r\nmechanism, the Council was acting ultra vires.\r\nMyanmar, together with the States members of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, upholds the principled \r\nposition of opposing any country-specific resolution. \r\nSuch resolutions are not conducive to meaningful \r\ndialogue and give rise to polarization, division and \r\neven confrontation.\r\nMany of us in this Hall have frequently stressed \r\nthat a constructive approach and genuine cooperation \r\nare very important for the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights. At this important juncture of efforts to \r\nimprove the efficiency of the Human Rights Council, \r\nobjectivity and impartiality are essential principles for \r\nall of us to adhere to, especially when it comes to an \r\nissue that could have a far-reaching impact on a Member \r\nState’s sovereignty and dignity.\r\nThe Government of Myanmar has rejected the \r\nHuman Rights Council’s establishment of a fact-finding \r\nmission on Myanmar since the beginning, because its \r\ncomposition and mandate raise serious concerns. It \r\nwould lack impartiality and hinder the Government’s \r\nown efforts to find long-term solutions to the situation \r\nin Rakhine state. The sincerity and ethics of the fact-\r\nfinding mission are questionable, as can be seen by its \r\nhasty issuance of a report in time for a Security Council \r\nmeeting on Myanmar and its distribution in a United \r\nNations conference room of pamphlets containing \r\nelements of hatred against a sovereign Member State.\r\nOn our position regarding the Special Rapporteur \r\non the situation of human rights in Myanmar, we have \r\nall along extended cooperation to the successive Special \r\nRapporteurs on Myanmar, in keeping with our policy \r\nto cooperate with the United Nations. Despite such \r\ncontinuous cooperation and accommodation, Myanmar \r\nis still being treated unfairly and discriminated against \r\nunder the pretext of human rights.\r\nMyanmar is committed to continuing to work \r\ntogether with the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. \r\nHowever, the people of Myanmar consider that it would \r\nno longer be productive to continue cooperation with \r\nthe current Special Rapporteur because of her lack \r\nof objectivity and non-compliance with the code of \r\nconduct. As such, we have requested that the Human \r\nRights Council replace her. We regret that our request \r\nhas, to date, fallen on deaf ears.\r\nSince cooperation with the United Nations is a \r\ncornerstone of Myanmar’s foreign policy, Myanmar \r\nwill continue to extend cooperation to the relevant \r\nUnited Nations mechanisms for the benefit of people of \r\nMyanmar. With that in mind, Myanmar has facilitated, \r\nA/73/PV.31 02/11/2018\r\n28/29 18-35714\r\nto date, three visits of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral since she assumed her duties in June 2018.\r\nThe Government of Myanmar has resolutely \r\nrejected the International Criminal Court’s ruling of \r\n6 September 2018 in connection with Rakhine state. \r\nOur position there is clear: Myanmar is not a party to \r\nthe Rome Statute, and the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) has no jurisdiction over Myanmar whatsoever. \r\nThe ICC’s decision was made on dubious legal grounds \r\nand concerned a situation where domestic remedies \r\nhave not yet been exhausted.\r\nThe Government of Myanmar takes every allegation \r\nof human rights violations seriously. The Government of \r\nMyanmar has established an Independent Commission \r\nof Enquiry comprising two international diplomats and \r\ntwo national eminent persons. The Commission will \r\ninvestigate all allegations of human rights violations \r\nand related issues following the terrorist attacks of \r\n9 October 2016 and 25 August 2017 by the Arakan \r\nRohingya Salvation Army in Rakhine state with a \r\nview to seeking accountability and reconciliation. The \r\nCommission will discharge its mandate in accordance \r\nwith the principles of independence, impartiality and \r\nobjectivity, and will submit its report within one year. \r\nWe are willing and able to deal with the accountability \r\nissues regarding any alleged human rights violations \r\nwhere there is sufficient evidence. We need, however, \r\nto give time and space to the Commission of Enquiry.\r\nAddressing the issues in Rakhine state is \r\na fundamental part of building peace, national \r\nreconciliation, security and good governance in \r\nMyanmar. The Government of Myanmar is, as a matter \r\nof high priority, preparing the necessary conditions \r\nconducive to the safe, voluntary and dignified return of \r\nthe people who have fled to Bangladesh. In accordance \r\nwith the bilateral agreements and arrangements with \r\nBangladesh, Myanmar is ready to receive the first batch \r\nof verified returnees. In accordance with the decision \r\nof the meeting of the joint working group established \r\nby Myanmar and Bangladesh, held in Dhaka this week, \r\nthe repatriation will begin next month. We welcome the \r\nagreement. We are also working with the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme to assist the \r\nspeedy and efficient resettlement and rehabilitation \r\nof returnees.\r\nThe challenges facing Myanmar are complex and \r\nmultifaceted. While striving tirelessly to solve the \r\nissue in Rakhine, the Government is trying to end the \r\narmed conflicts that have ravaged the country since its \r\nindependence in 1948 and bring about peace with a \r\nlarge number of ethnic armed groups. The Government \r\nis persisting in its efforts with respect to the peace \r\nprocess and national reconciliation.\r\nThe greatest strength of a democratic transition is \r\nthe unity, determination and active participation of the \r\npeople under the leadership of State Counsellor Aung \r\nSan Suu Kyi. We have strong faith in the strength of our \r\nnational resilience as we face the formidable challenges \r\nthat we are encountering today. We are resolute in our \r\ndetermination to fulfil the ultimate aspirations of the \r\npeople to build a democratic federal union, in which \r\njustice, freedom and equal opportunity for all its \r\ncitizens are guaranteed. The international community \r\ncan best assist Myanmar in realizing its democratic \r\nnation-building by making constructive contributions \r\ntowards Myanmar’s endeavours based on understanding \r\nand mutual respect.\r\nThe resolutions and decision on Myanmar contained \r\nin the report of the Human Rights Council (Council \r\nresolutions S-27/1, 37/32 and 29/21 and decision \r\n36/115) are not conducive to meaningful dialogue, but \r\ngive rise only to polarization, and even confrontation. \r\nTheir focus on confrontation and retribution will only \r\nbe counterproductive. Against that backdrop, we will \r\ncontinue to categorically reject those resolutions and \r\nthat decision.\r\nMr. Kuzmenkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Recent years have witnessed a steady uptick \r\nin confrontation and politicization in the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, which impedes the thorough \r\nand constructive discussion of human rights issues. \r\nWe are alarmed at the ongoing practice on the part of a \r\nnumber of States, or groups of the States, to attempt to \r\nexploit human rights as a weapon for applying political \r\npressure and imposing their values systems, without \r\ntaking into account the national, historic, economic and \r\ncultural specificities of States.\r\nWe note the contrived saturation of the Council’s \r\nagenda with country-specific issues. At the same time, \r\nthe designation of so-called delinquent countries is \r\narbitrary and politically motivated. The human rights \r\nsituation in a given country may indeed be a legitimate \r\ncause for concern on the part of the international \r\ncommunity. However, we cannot countenance \r\ninterference in the domestic affairs of States and \r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.31\r\n18-35714 29/29\r\npressure being brought to bear under a human rights-\r\nrelated pretext. That is an egregious violation of \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nSelective criticism and labelling discredit the United \r\nNations Human Rights Council. That kind of practice \r\nmakes it appear that the United human rights system \r\nlacks credibility and that cooperation with that system \r\nis pointless. As a consequence, United Nations human \r\nrights initiatives become ineffective and less relevant.\r\nAt present, we do not see genuine dialogue and \r\ncooperation within the Council, and yet those very \r\nprinciples should guide it. In order for the Council to be \r\nmore effective, it should focus on the delivery of technical \r\nassistance to States, and that only with their explicit \r\nconsent. We regret the persistent attempts to impose \r\nmyriad oversight procedures on States — procedures \r\nthat sometimes duplicate others. Those multiplying \r\nstructures weigh heavily on the United Nations budget, \r\nand the results from that approach seldom justify the \r\nburden it imposes.\r\nWe are alarmed at the entrenched practice of \r\npopulating the Human Rights Council’s agenda with \r\nitems with a clear political subtext and that have \r\nnothing to do with human rights or are at odds with the \r\nCouncil’s mandate. That is attested to by the repeated \r\nattempts to include wording in documents of the Human \r\nRights Council that can be exploited as a pretext for \r\nthe referral of certain country-specific issues to the \r\nSecurity Council or the International Criminal Court, \r\nor for evoking the so-called responsibility to protect. \r\nThat is a counterproductive approach and does not \r\nhelp establish effective dialogue on the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights.\r\nThe Human Rights Council, with its present \r\nstructure and rules of procedure, was created by all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations. The introduction \r\nof any changes to its work, be they substantive or \r\nprocedural, can be done only in a collegial manner \r\nand following relevant, comprehensive international \r\ndiscussions. By that we mean taking into account the \r\nviews of all States Members of the United Nations, not \r\nmerely those of current members of the Council.\r\nWe reject attempts to subjectively adjust the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms. That \r\nis at odds with the founding documents of the Human \r\nRights Council and the General Assembly. We are \r\nalarmed at the mounting proposals in Geneva regarding \r\nthe need to introduce a number of so-called technical \r\nchanges in the work of the Universal Periodic Review. \r\nAt this point, when the third cycle of the review is at \r\nits height, that approach undermines the core principles \r\nof non-discrimination, constructive dialogue and \r\ncooperation within the Council. We are perturbed by \r\nthe proposals to leverage the forthcoming review of the \r\nstatus of the Council to be held in 2021, as set out in \r\nresolution 65/281, with a view to discussing the whole \r\nrange of issues pertaining to its operations and its \r\noverall role within the United Nations system.\r\nIn that connection, we cannot support the plans \r\nof a number of regional groups to fine-tune and \r\nsimultaneously reinforce in years to come the link \r\nbetween the Council and all of the bodies at United \r\nNations Headquarters in New York, not just the General \r\nAssembly. Let us recall that the Council’s terms of \r\nreference are clearly set out in its founding resolution \r\n60/251 and were reaffirmed in resolution 65/281. It \r\nis important to bear in mind that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil reports to the General Assembly.\r\nThe Russian Federation is convinced that the \r\neffectiveness of the work of the Council hinges directly \r\non how stringently its member States and observers \r\ncomply with the established rules and procedures, \r\nmandates and tasks conferred upon the Council by \r\nthe General Assembly. We urge States to adopt a more \r\nconscientious approach in their work and to clearly and \r\nfully uphold the principle of the rule of law, the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly and the Council and \r\nof course, its founding documents.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
