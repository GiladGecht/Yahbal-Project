"United Nations A/73/PV.32\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n32nd plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 2 November 2018, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Beleffi (San \r\nMarino), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 69 (continued)\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council (A/73/53 \r\nand A/73/53/Add.1)\r\nMr. Sarmantayev (Kazakhstan): We would like to \r\nwelcome His Excellency Mr. Vojislav Šuc, President of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, and thank him for briefing \r\nus on the work and achievements of the Council in \r\n2018 (see A/73/PV.31). We would also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to congratulate Ms. Bachelet on her \r\nappointment as the next High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights and all the newly elected Human Rights Council \r\nmembers and wish them all success in their important \r\nwork.\r\nOver the 12 years of its existence, the Council \r\nhas proved to be the key United Nations human rights \r\ninstitution contributing to the promotion and the \r\nprotection of human rights at both the global and the \r\nnational levels. The Council has also demonstrated its \r\nability to respond rapidly to human rights violations in \r\nvarious parts of the world. Kazakhstan is convinced that \r\nthe work of the Council should continue to be guided by \r\nthe principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity, \r\nnon-selectivity and constructive international dialogue \r\nwith a view to promoting and protecting all human \r\nrights — civil, political, economic, social and cultural. \r\nThe Council serves as the main forum for dialogue on \r\nthe thematic issues in the sphere of human rights. The \r\nCouncil also brings to the attention of the international \r\ncommunity the human rights situations in many \r\ncountries and thematic concerns that require particular \r\nattention.\r\nIn order to be effective and lead to positive results \r\non the ground, the Council’s work on country situations \r\nshould be based primarily on the issues of technical \r\ncooperation and capacity-building, instead of increased \r\nmonitoring and investigation activities. In that sense, \r\ndialogue and the constructive engagement of the \r\nCouncil’s country-specific mechanisms with States \r\nshould be at the heart of its activities.\r\nWe believe, as many others do, that the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review is truly the most effective, impartial \r\nand depoliticized mechanism of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil; it has its own dynamic and most importantly, \r\nis universally recognized. We take an active part in the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review session and are preparing to \r\ngo through our own third cycle in fall of 2019.\r\nKazakhstan has also been actively cooperating \r\nwith the Human Rights Council’s special procedures. \r\nAs members may know, my country is among those that \r\nhave issued them a standing invitation, which confirms \r\nour openness and strong commitment to the promotion \r\nand protection of all human rights in our country. In \r\nthat regard, I would like to note that we are expecting \r\nthe Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights and fundamental freedoms while \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Next year, we are also expecting to \r\ndiscuss our reports in the United Nations Committee on \r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United \r\nNations Committee on the Rights of Persons with \r\nDisabilities.\r\nKazakhstan fully supports the work of the Human \r\nRights Council in promoting, justice, dignity and \r\nequality for all. I take this opportunity to inform \r\nmembers of the Assembly that we are putting forward \r\nour candidacy for the Human Rights Council starting \r\nin 2022.\r\nIn conclusion, let me confirm Kazakhstan’s \r\ncommitment to the protection of fundamental human \r\nrights and freedoms, and further close interaction with \r\nall mechanisms of the global human rights network.\r\nMr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to convey the sincere appreciation of my delegation \r\nto the President of the Human Rights Council (HRC), \r\nthe Ambassador of Slovenia, Mr. Vojislav Šuc, for his \r\nable and effective management of the HRC’s activities, \r\nand particularly for his leadership in the preparation \r\nprocess to the review of the functioning of the HRC.\r\nUkraine attaches great importance to the review of \r\nthe HRC’s work. We are convinced that the result of the \r\nreview should improve and strengthen the effectiveness \r\nof the Council and its ability to protect human rights. \r\nIn that regard, I would like to underline the importance \r\nof strengthening the prevention aspect of the Council’s \r\nactivities. We believe that the Council should \r\nincreasingly strengthen the preventive dimension of \r\nits activity and address, in a timely and proactive way, \r\nemerging human rights situations in order to prevent \r\ngrave human rights violations, crimes against humanity \r\nand genocide.\r\nThe persistence of human rights violations around \r\nthe globe clearly demonstrates the need to focus more \r\nattention on preventive action. Regrettably, oftentimes \r\nwe can see that the norms of international human rights \r\nlaw and international humanitarian law are breached \r\nand f louted with impunity.\r\nIn 2010, Ukraine initiated the introduction of an \r\nelement of prevention into the work of the Human \r\nRights Council and advocated the adoption of Human \r\nRights Council resolutions on the role of prevention in \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights. We are \r\ngrateful to the core group countries for their cooperation \r\nin supporting and developing that subject. Preventive \r\nmeasures and strategies are progressively gaining \r\nimportance as an effective tool to avert preventable \r\nthreats and emergencies in the human rights sphere. \r\nDue to the fundamental and overarching nature of \r\nprevention, broad interregional dialogue and holistic \r\nconsideration are necessary.\r\nThe elaboration of an agreed concept of prevention \r\nand applicable guidance, endorsed by the United \r\nNations, could assist in providing an adequate level \r\nof human rights protection and strengthening well-\r\ndeveloped conflict prevention mechanisms at the \r\nUnited Nations. The Human Rights Council has a \r\ncrucial role to play in achieving that objective. We are \r\nready to continue and strengthen cooperation with all \r\ninterested stakeholders in order to deepen the concept \r\nof prevention and fully exploit the preventive potential \r\nof the Council.\r\nUkraine highly appreciates the contribution of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and its special procedures to \r\naddress the current human rights situation in Ukraine, \r\nincluding in the occupied Crimea. Ukraine is interested \r\nin and open to a broad and inclusive interaction on that \r\ntrack, and in that spirit we initiated HRC resolution \r\n26/30, entitled “Cooperation and assistance to Ukraine \r\nin the field of human rights”. We appreciate the support \r\nof the United Nations Member States and international \r\ninstitutions for our human rights aspirations. We also \r\nbelieve that such international support should include \r\nefforts to counter human rights violations committed as \r\na result of Russian aggression, including in particular \r\nin the occupied territories.\r\nUkraine attaches exceptional importance to the \r\nimplementation of resolutions 71/205 and 72/190 on the \r\nsituation of human rights in the Autonomous Republic \r\nof Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, in \r\nparticular the provisions providing for the international \r\nmonitoring of the situation in Crimea, where human \r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.32\r\n18-35949 3/8\r\nrights have been under constant attack by the Russian \r\noccupying Power since 2014.\r\nWe commend the work of the human rights \r\nmonitoring mission in Ukraine and commit to continuing \r\nour close cooperation with the mission. The mission’s \r\nrecommendations for Ukraine help us make progress \r\nin achieving the highest international standards in the \r\nfield of human rights. We also note the tremendous \r\nefforts of the High Commissioner’s Office in preparing \r\nthe second dedicated thematic report on the situation of \r\nhuman rights in the temporarily occupied Autonomous \r\nRepublic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, pursuant \r\nto resolution 72/190.\r\nDespite having been denied entry to the Ukrainian \r\npeninsula by the Russian Federation, the monitoring \r\nmission had multiple reliable sources of information \r\nto conduct quality monitoring of human rights \r\ndevelopments in the occupied Crimea. At the same \r\ntime, acknowledging the efforts of the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nin monitoring the situation at development distance, we \r\ncontinue to insist on and call for direct reporting from \r\nthe ground.\r\nThe continuing aggression of the Russian Federation \r\nnot only negatively affects the security and humanitarian \r\nsituations in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, but \r\nalso seriously undermines the basic human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms of the civilians remaining in the \r\nterritories not under Ukrainian Government control. \r\nThe grave violations and abuses of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms committed by the Russian \r\noccupation administrations in Donbas and Crimea must \r\nnot be ignored. Russia must abide by its obligations as \r\nan occupying Power and prevent humanitarian crises in \r\nthe territories under its temporary control.\r\nUkraine fully supports the system of special \r\nprocedures as a unique independent monitoring \r\nmechanism within the Human Rights Council and as \r\nan integral part of the United Nations human rights \r\nmachinery. We firmly believe that cooperation and \r\ntransparency are crucial to the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights. With that in mind, Ukraine has long \r\ntime maintained an open invitation to all Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s special procedures.\r\nWe would like to thank Mr. Nils Melzer, Special \r\nRapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or \r\ndegrading treatment or punishment; Mr. Juan Pablo \r\nBohoslavsky, Independent Expert on the effects of \r\nforeign debt and other related international financial \r\nobligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human \r\nrights, particularly economic, social and cultural \r\nrights; and members of the Working Group on Enforced \r\nor Involuntary Disappearances for the missions they \r\nhave conducted in Ukraine over the past year. The \r\nUkrainian authorities are fully committed to providing \r\nthe integrity of visits of all special procedures and other \r\nmonitoring mechanisms in order to ensure the full \r\nimplementation of their mandates.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that Ukraine remains \r\ncommitted to actively engaging further in the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council.\r\nMr. Sukhee (Mongolia): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to express our sincere appreciation to Ambassador \r\nVojislav Šuc, President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nfor his leadership and presentation of the report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council (A/73/53 and A/73/53/Add.1) to \r\nthe General Assembly today.\r\nMy delegation commends the Human Rights \r\nCouncil as a key platform for constructive dialogue \r\nand cooperation on promoting human rights. The \r\ncurrent report of the Council paints a realistic picture \r\nof the current human rights situations and challenges \r\nworldwide and recommends possible ways and \r\ninstruments to defend human rights, equality and \r\ndignity and combat intolerance, discrimination and \r\nviolence.\r\nWith the strong and wide support of Member \r\nStates, Mongolia joined the Human Rights Council \r\nin 2016 for the first time. The Council possesses a \r\nunique mandate to promote universal respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, guided by \r\nthe principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity \r\nand non-selectivity. Human rights are a universal value, \r\nand as a member of the Human Rights Council we are \r\ncommitted to promoting human rights for all. In that \r\nregard, I am pleased to note that my Government has \r\nsupported the Human Rights Council’s initiatives \r\naimed at protecting the rights of the child, women and \r\npersons with disabilities, the freedom of expression \r\nand the freedom of assembly and association as priority \r\nissues outlined in our voluntary pledges.\r\nMongolia has been a strong supporter of the \r\nCouncil’s mechanisms. We have therefore extended a \r\nstanding invitation to and constructively cooperated \r\nwith the special procedures mandate-holders since early \r\n2004. Since then, we have received visits of the Special \r\nA/73/PV.32 02/11/2018\r\n4/8 18-35949\r\nRapporteurs on the right to food, on torture, on the right \r\nto education, on extreme poverty and on human rights, \r\nas well as a visit of the Working Group on business and \r\nhuman rights. Most recently, the Special Rapporteur \r\non the issue of human rights obligations relating to \r\nthe enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable \r\nenvironment and the Special Rapporteur on the human \r\nrights to safe drinking water and sanitation paid visits \r\nto my country. Furthermore, we have accepted a request \r\nfrom the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human \r\nrights defenders and the Independent Expert on the \r\neffects of foreign debt and other related international \r\nfinancial obligations of States on the full enjoyment \r\nof all human rights, particularly economic, social and \r\ncultural rights to pay a working visit to Mongolia in \r\n2019.\r\nWe will continue to attach importance to the \r\ntreaty body reporting. We appreciate the fact that \r\nmore committees are adopting the simplified reporting \r\nprocedure, which we consider to be practicable \r\nand effective both in terms of the workload of the \r\ncommittees and member States, like Mongolia, that \r\nface capacity restraints.\r\nOne of the major achievements of the Human \r\nRights Council is indisputably the Universal Periodic \r\nReview (UPR) — an effective mechanism to assess the \r\nhuman rights situations of all the States Members of \r\nthe United Nations. We remain firmly committed to \r\nthe UPR process. In order to fulfil our commitment, \r\nthe recommendations have been translated into the \r\nnational plan of action for 2016-2019. In July 2018, \r\nwe launched a technical assistance project, with the \r\nsupport of the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), to advance \r\nthe implementation of the action plan, which, inter alia, \r\nincludes establishing a national preventive mechanism, \r\ndeveloping mandatory training programmes on human \r\nrights, establishing a national mechanism for reporting \r\nand follow-up, and creating a national recommendations \r\ntracking database. We are of the view that OHCHR has \r\na key role to play in disseminating and advancing best \r\npractices for enhancing national capacity, including, \r\ninter alia, strengthening the potential of national human \r\nrights institutions by providing technical assistance in \r\nsupport of the efforts of States so as to allow them to \r\nfulfil their human rights obligations.\r\nAs a member of the Council, we attach great \r\nimportance to the ongoing discussions on strengthening \r\nthe efficiency of the Council. We consider that the \r\nstrengthening of the Human Rights Council should \r\nprimarily focus on enhancing its contribution to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. However, we \r\nresolutely support the view that any agreement reached \r\non long-term efficiency measures should be adopted \r\nby a consensual decision. Mongolia stands ready to \r\nprovide its support for initiatives aimed at improving \r\nthe working methods of the Council in a manner that \r\nis beneficial to all States, as well as other relevant \r\nstakeholders.\r\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm the firm commitment \r\nof my Government to working closely with the High \r\nCommissioner and her Office.\r\nMs. Feldman (Australia): Australia thanks the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council (HRC) for the \r\npresentation of his report of the Council (A/73/53 and \r\nA/73/53/Add.1).\r\nAs a member of the HRC, Australia is pleased to \r\ntake this opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to \r\nthe Council as a leading component of the multilateral \r\nhuman rights system. We commend the President for \r\nhis determined and ongoing leadership in efforts to \r\nstrengthen the Human Rights Council and improve \r\nits efficiency. Australia will continue to engage \r\nconstructively in those efforts by supporting outcomes \r\nthat enhance the Council’s core mandate of promoting \r\nand protecting human rights and preventing and \r\naddressing human rights violations. Australia also \r\nbelieves that measures taken must not hinder the \r\nability of civil society or small States, including those \r\nnot present in Geneva, to engage in the work of the \r\nCouncil. Australia has supported a range of proposals \r\nunder discussion, including capping the number of \r\npanel discussions, improved transparency on potential \r\nbudget impacts and biennializing or triennializing \r\nresolutions. We remain open to further creative and \r\nconstructive ideas from member States to strengthen \r\nthe Human Rights Council.\r\nWhile Australia recognizes that efficiencies can \r\nand must be found, United Nations Member States must \r\nalso ensure that the Human Rights Council is adequately \r\nresourced to carry out its mandate. Efforts to improve \r\nthe efficiency of the Human Rights Council are closely \r\nlinked to those to improve its effectiveness. We remain \r\ncommitted to strengthening the Human Rights Council \r\nthrough cooperation, transparency and objectivity — a \r\npoint Australia made in its incoming member’s pledge, \r\ndelivered during the HRC’s first session in 2018. We \r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.32\r\n18-35949 5/8\r\nhope to see that pledge taken up by all members, and \r\nwe invite all States recently elected to the Council for \r\nthe term 2019-2021 to adopt the pledge at the fortieth \r\nregular session of the HRC.\r\nWe continue to stress the need for stronger processes \r\nto ensure that HRC members uphold the highest \r\nhuman rights standards. We should also strengthen \r\ncivil society engagement and reduce the number of \r\nresolutions and proliferation of mandates to allow \r\nStates to focus on implementation as the crucial next \r\nstep in improving human rights. Australia was proud \r\nto sponsor the non-governmental organization-led \r\nevent for Council candidates held here in New York in \r\nSeptember to promote greater transparency. We urge \r\nall States seeking election to the HRC to participate in \r\nsuch events.\r\nMr. Giorgio (Eritrea): Eritrea welcomes the \r\nopportunity to interact with the President of the Human \r\nRights Council and takes note of the report of the \r\nCouncil (A/73/53 and A/73/53/Add.1).\r\nMy delegation fully associates itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of \r\nMozambique (see A/73/PV.31) on behalf of the Group \r\nof African States.\r\nThe Human Rights Council — a subsidiary organ of \r\nthe General Assembly — has the principal responsibility \r\nfor ensuring universal respect for the protection of all \r\nhuman rights in a fair and equal manner, as enshrined \r\nin resolution 60/251. We recall that the establishment \r\nof the Council was the result of the failure of the \r\nCommission on Human Rights to effectively fulfil its \r\nmandate owing to politicization and double standards. \r\nUnfortunately, the Human Rights Council continues to \r\nsuffer from the same ills that led to the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights becoming defunct. If we fail to adhere to \r\nthe sacrosanct principles of mutual respect and indulge \r\nin politicization and double standards, as we often \r\ndo, inevitably the fate of our sole intergovernmental \r\nbody on human rights will be the same as that of its \r\npredecessor.\r\nEritrea is an independent and constructive State \r\nactor. It believes in international peace and progress \r\nand that the promotion of human rights is optimally \r\nachieved through solidarity among nations and genuine, \r\nmutually beneficial partnerships. As a member of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for the term from 2019-2021, \r\nit will work to achieve a more effective and credible \r\nCouncil. It will endeavour to engage in inclusive, cross-\r\nregional and transparent dialogue on the protection and \r\nthe promotion of human rights across all countries and \r\nregions.\r\nThe work of the Council continues to expand \r\nwith the increased adoption of resolutions. While the \r\nefficacy of their contributions remains questionable, \r\nthere is a serious need to comprehensively assess and \r\nask ourselves whether the current work of the Council \r\nis reflective of the huge responsibility and weight that \r\nit bears in safeguarding the principles contained in the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and as the body \r\nresponsible for the effective maintenance of human \r\nrights within the United Nations system.\r\nThere is also a need to uphold the intergovernmental \r\ncharacter both of the agenda and of the working \r\nmethods of the Council. Considering the importance \r\nof reassessing the work of the Council, we cannot \r\nunderestimate the significance of the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\n(OHCHR) as a leading United Nations entity in the \r\narea of human rights in supporting Member States in \r\nthe realization of their human rights obligations. In \r\nthat regard, OHCHR should provide equal attention to \r\nall human rights issues, as well as ensure that every \r\nmember of the Secretariat fulfils its obligation to \r\nmaintain the independence and integrity of the Office. \r\nEritrea continues to advocate for OHCHR programmes \r\nto be funded from the United Nations regular budget.\r\nEritrea stresses the cardinal importance of \r\npromoting constructive international dialogue and \r\ncooperation in dealing with human rights issues. In that \r\nregard, we restate our firm belief in the centrality of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review in the fulfilment of States’ \r\nhuman rights obligations and in the improvement of the \r\nsituation on the ground.\r\nEritrea rejects the selective manner in which human \r\nrights continue to be addressed in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. Eritrea opposes all politically motivated \r\ncountry-specific mandates, which continue to be \r\ncounterproductive and a waste of resources that could \r\nhave otherwise been used for the concrete promotion of \r\nhuman rights. In that connection, Eritrea disassociates \r\nitself from the part of the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil containing the text of Human Rights Council \r\nresolution 38/15, entitled “Situation of human rights in \r\nEritrea”.\r\nFinally, Eritrea reiterates its commitment to \r\nredoubling its own efforts in ensuring a dignified life for \r\nA/73/PV.32 02/11/2018\r\n6/8 18-35949\r\nevery one of its citizens. During its term in the Council, \r\nit will work to enhance the credibility of the Council by \r\nencouraging increased dialogue and cooperation.\r\nMr. Clyne (New Zealand): New Zealand would \r\nlike to thank the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nfor his presentation of the annual report of the Human \r\nRights Council (see A/73/PV.31).\r\nWe are pleased that the Human Rights Council was \r\nrecently able to turn its attention to the disproportionately \r\nhigh maternal mortality and morbidity rates affecting \r\nwomen and girls in humanitarian settings. In a core \r\ngroup of Burkina Faso, Colombia, Estonia and New \r\nZealand, we were proud to present resolution 39/10, \r\nentitled “Preventable maternal mortality and morbidity \r\nand human rights in humanitarian settings”. The \r\nresolution was adopted by the Human Rights Council \r\nby consensus on 28 September and enjoyed a large \r\ncross-regional group of sponsors. The Council has sent \r\na clear message that States must ensure accountability \r\nand take responsibility for ensuring the right of women \r\nand girls to an effective remedy for violations of their \r\nrights to sexual and reproductive health. They must \r\nalso guarantee the non-recurrence of those violations \r\nin humanitarian settings.\r\nThe resolution also urges States to bring laws and \r\npolicies concerning sexual and reproductive health, \r\nincluding international assistance policies, into line \r\nwith international human rights law and to repeal \r\ndiscriminatory laws relating to third-party authorization \r\nfor health information and health-care services. We \r\nlook forward to the Council’s ongoing work on this \r\nimportant issue. That includes a two-day meeting in \r\n2019 to discuss good practices, gaps and challenges \r\nin the application of a human rights-based approach \r\nto the implementation of policies and programmes to \r\nreduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity in \r\nhumanitarian settings.\r\nMr. Bin Momen (Bangladesh): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to thank the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for presenting his reports (see A/73/PV.31).\r\nThis year, Bangladesh was once again elected to \r\nthe Human Rights Council to represent the Group of \r\nAsia-Pacific States for the 2019-2021 term. We take \r\nthis opportunity to once again thank Member States for \r\ntheir support to Bangladesh. We are fully committed to \r\nfulfilling the pledges and commitments that we have \r\nmade and upholding the high objectives of the Council. \r\nThe election of Bangladesh to the Council twice \r\nthroughout the terms of the current Government is a \r\ntestament to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s unstinting \r\nefforts to uphold the rights and dignity of people.\r\nThe delegation of Bangladesh finds the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism to be a useful tool for \r\nthe Human Rights Council to engage with each and \r\nevery Member State on human rights issues. We did \r\nour Universal Periodic Review in May, during which \r\nthe international community highly appreciated our \r\ngood practices in upholding human rights. With the \r\nengagement of all concerned actors, we regularly follow \r\nup on the implementation of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview recommendations. As an elected member of \r\nthe Council, Bangladesh will continue to promote such \r\nconstructive mechanisms of the Council in the coming \r\ndays.\r\nIt is incumbent upon all Member States to \r\npreserve the sanctity and credibility of the Human \r\nRights Council. The Council membership reflects the \r\ndiversity of the comity of nations and is integral to the \r\nownership and effectiveness of its work. It serves no \r\npurpose to undermine the Council without appreciating \r\nthe progressive, aspirational nature of its work and \r\naccomplishments. No Member State can claim to have \r\na perfectly sound human rights record, and it is only \r\nexpected that the Council will forge ahead with its \r\nwork, navigating the many challenges and difficulties \r\ninherent within its membership. We urge all Member \r\nStates to constructively engage with the Council’s work \r\nand ensure the provision of adequate resources for the \r\neffective delivery of its mandates. In parallel, sustained \r\nefforts must continue to enhance further efficiency and \r\neffectiveness in the Council’s work. Bangladesh will \r\ncontinue to advocate for not using the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for political expedience or retaliation.\r\nThe monitoring of the Human Rights Council’s \r\nwork by media and civil society adds value to its work. \r\nIt is, however, regrettable if the perception is created \r\nthat this work is guided by the interests and priorities of \r\ncertain Member States. It is also critical that thorough \r\nresearch and informed consultations be conducted \r\nbefore making passing comments about or ascribing \r\nscorecards to the human rights record or performance \r\nof individual Member States.\r\nIn the interest of objectivity, it is critical that \r\nMember States engage with the mandate-holders and \r\nnot with the individuals embodying the mandate at \r\nany given time. It is the prerogative of the Secretary-\r\n02/11/2018 A/73/PV.32\r\n18-35949 7/8\r\nGeneral to appoint the mandate-holders, and it is \r\nincumbent on Member States to facilitate the discharge \r\nof their respective mandates. We do not subscribe to the \r\nidea of refusing to engage with a mandate-holder on the \r\nbasis of his or her individual identity. If questions are \r\nraised about his or her objectivity or impartiality, the \r\nconcerned Member States and others concerned should \r\ncontinue to remain engaged in the interest of promoting \r\na balanced approach.\r\nDuring the Council’s most recent session, \r\nBangladesh took an evident interest in the follow-up to \r\nthe work of the independent international fact-finding \r\nmission on Myanmar. We reiterate our appreciation to \r\nthe fact-finding mission for its authoritative work in \r\ndocumenting evidence-based information on the gravest \r\ncrimes under international law committed against the \r\nRohingya and other people forcibly displaced from \r\nMyanmar’s Rakhine state. We believe that the Council \r\ntook decisive action yet again in renewing the mandate \r\nof the fact-finding mission and in deciding to establish \r\nan ongoing investigation mechanism to collate, analyse \r\nand preserve the evidence of atrocity crimes against the \r\nRohingya and others affected.\r\nWe have always maintained that the possibility for \r\nthe repatriation of the Rohingya to their place of origin \r\nin Myanmar can be realized only in an environment \r\nthat restores their safety, dignity, human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. We see the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s engagement to be an effort to safeguard \r\nthe interests of the Rohingya and other minorities in \r\nKachin and Shan states from the systematic human \r\nrights violations to which they had been subjected to \r\ndate. The outright rejection of the Council’s overtures \r\nto Myanmar can be construed by those affected as a \r\ncontinued denial by the concerned State of the human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms of the Rohingya, \r\nincluding their pathway to citizenship. We regret \r\nMyanmar’s non-cooperation to date with the fact-\r\nfinding mission and the Special Rapporteur on the \r\nsituation of human rights in Myanmar. The question of \r\nthe objective of the mission or the Special Rapporteur \r\ncan be raised only if Myanmar constructively engages \r\nwith them.\r\nAccountability can serve as an important \r\nconfidence-building measure for the Rohingya to \r\nreturn voluntarily, without which their repatriation \r\nwould not be sustainable. While our continued efforts \r\nand readiness for the safe, voluntary and dignified \r\nrepatriation of Rohingyas to their original place \r\nof abode in the Rakhine state are about to come to \r\nfruition, one should not be oblivious to the imperative \r\nneed to ensure accountability for the gravest atrocities \r\nperpetrated against them. Accountability is crucial to \r\nthe implementation of the bilateral instruments and \r\nshould therefore be pursued in earnest. We would like \r\nto reiterate our commitment to working closely with the \r\nHuman Rights Council in the coming days.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in exercise of the \r\nright of reply, may I remind members that statements \r\nin the exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 \r\nminutes for the first intervention and 5 minutes for the \r\nsecond, and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats.\r\nMr. Ju Hyok So (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): My delegation would like to exercise its right of \r\nreply with regard to the statement made by the observer \r\nof the European Union (EU).\r\nWe condemn the politicized allegations made by \r\nthe EU against the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, which bear no relation to the genuine protection \r\nand promotion of human rights. My delegation strongly \r\nrejects the forcibly adopted, anti-Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea resolutions of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, as well as its Special Rapporteur, the Group \r\nof Independent Experts on Accountability pursuant to \r\nHuman Rights Council Resolution 31/18 on the situation \r\nof human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea, and the report of the commission of inquiry \r\non human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea (A/HRC/25/63), because they are based on \r\nlies and information that are fabricated to tarnish and \r\noverthrow the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\nThose lies and information are fabricated by defectors \r\nin line with the plotted scenario of the hostile forces, \r\nwith the worst coming from the mouths of the human \r\nscum criminals who have betrayed their motherland, \r\nabandoned their families and escaped after committing \r\ncrimes — all to earn money.\r\nIt is disrespectful towards and a mockery \r\nof the international community for the EU and \r\nWestern countries to spread without hesitation the \r\nlies and sophistry of those worthless defectors in \r\nthis international Hall. It is the EU and Western \r\ncountries that have committed vicious human rights \r\nviolations throughout the world, such as Islamophobia, \r\nA/73/PV.32 02/11/2018\r\n8/8 18-35949\r\nxenophobia, the humiliation of ethnic minorities, sexual \r\nviolence and so on. The current global refugee crisis \r\nis attributable to the Western countries. My delegation \r\nstrongly requests that the EU and Western countries \r\ndo not fuss over the non-existent Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea human rights issue, but focus instead \r\non solving their own miserable human rights situations.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 69.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.40 p.m.\r\n"
