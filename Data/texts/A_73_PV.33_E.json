The various segments and the High-\r\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development under \r\nthe auspices of the Council helped us to see clearly that \r\nwe have made some significant progress, yet we still \r\nhave a long road to travel in order to realize sustainable \r\nand resilient societies while leaving no one behind. \r\nThe Economic and Social Council contributed in many \r\nways to bringing us closer to achieving these goals. \r\nAllow me to briefly outline some of the highlights of \r\nthe 2018 session.\r\nUnder the auspices of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, the 2018 High-level Political Forum allowed \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

The Forum played its role as the \r\ncentral platform for follow-up and review of progress \r\nof the 2030 Agenda through its theme “Transformation \r\ntowards sustainable and resilient societies” and through \r\nits review of six of the SDGs: water and sanitation; \r\nsustainable and modern energy; cities and human \r\nsettlements; sustainable consumption and production \r\npatterns; life on land; and global partnership.\r\nSome 46 countries presented voluntary national \r\nreviews. We broke new ground not only in terms of the \r\nnumber of reviews but also in terms of their analytical \r\nnature and robustness. The voluntary national reviews \r\nshowed that many countries have made great strides in \r\naligning their policies with the SDGs, in mobilizing \r\nand organizing institutions and in undertaking actions \r\nto reach the targets. They also provided unique insight \r\ninto the challenges countries face, notably in conducting \r\nintegrated policies or mobilizing financing or data. The \r\nForum also broke new ground in terms of the proactive \r\nengagement of stakeholders in the discussions.\r\nThe Development Cooperation Forum allowed us to \r\nlook at the SDGs from the perspective of development \r\ncooperation. We explored the role that development \r\ncooperation can play in helping to address poverty \r\nor reverse negative trends in inequality or climate \r\nchange. The Development Cooperation Forum sounded \r\na wake-up call — in order to meet the deadlines and \r\nexpectations set out in the 2030 Agenda, development \r\ncooperation needs to change more radically and much \r\nfaster. I trust that the Economic and Social Council \r\nwill continue to reflect on this transformation in the \r\ncoming year.\r\nThe 2018 high-level segment of the Economic \r\nand Social Council represented the culmination of the \r\nCouncil’s cycle on its main theme, “From global to \r\nlocal: supporting sustainable and resilient societies in \r\nurban and rural communities”. We championed a new \r\napproach to the high-level segment. The meeting looked \r\nto the long term and analysed the tremendous future \r\nimpacts that phenomena such as economic, demographic \r\nand technological change will have on different aspects \r\nof society. We also examined long-term trends and \r\nscenarios to offer evidence-based projections for the \r\nfuture achievement of the SDGs. This forward-looking \r\napproach was endorsed by the General Assembly in its \r\nrecent resolution on the strengthening of the Economic \r\nand Social Council (resolution 72/305).\r\nThe segments and forums, functional commissions \r\nand expert bodies of the Economic and Social Council \r\ndelivered a range of integrated policy options and \r\nrecommendations related to the SDGs. We brought \r\ntogether the Chairs of all subsidiary bodies to make their \r\nwork more coherent and supportive of the Economic \r\nand Social Council and the High-level Political Forum.\r\nThe Committee for Development Policy’s session \r\nwas unusual this year. For the first time, it took an \r\nin-depth look at policies to leave no one behind and \r\nensure integrated approaches in all countries having \r\nconducted voluntary national reviews since the outset \r\nof the High-level Political Forum. It was also able to \r\ndeliver good news on the number of least developed \r\ncountries reaching graduation levels.\r\nThe 2018 Economic and Social Council Forum on \r\nFinancing for Development Follow-up sent a message \r\nof support on the centrality of multilateralism and \r\nconstructive engagement for financing the 2030 \r\nAgenda. The outcome of the Forum agreed among \r\nthe participating Governments achieved important \r\nprogress in the areas of building resilience, adapting \r\nto digitalization and mainstreaming gender equality, as \r\nwell as in blended finance, innovative debt instruments \r\nand incentives for the private sector. It also helped to \r\nbuild understanding on some issues on which a range of \r\nviews exist. The inaugural SDG Investment Fair, held \r\nimmediately before the Financing for Development \r\nFollow-up Forum, responded to the large and growing \r\nneeds for additional investments in the SDGs, especially \r\nin the poorest and most vulnerable countries.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council also convened \r\nits annual special meeting on international cooperation \r\nin tax matters. The special meeting served as an \r\nimportant opportunity to discuss emerging tax policy \r\nand administration issues, including relevant challenges \r\nresulting from the digitalization of the economy. \r\nOverall, the Economic and Social Council showed that, \r\ntogether, we can find solutions to keep the 2030 Agenda \r\non track towards our shared goals.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council continued \r\nto strengthen its leadership role in identifying new \r\nfrontiers in sustainable development and promoting \r\nreflection, open dialogue and innovative and integrated \r\nthinking. It broke new ground in the reflection on \r\ntechnologies and the SDGs. The joint meeting of \r\n05/11/2018 A/73/PV.33\r\n18-36059 3/4\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the Second \r\nCommittee of the General Assembly, whose theme was \r\n“The future of everything — sustainable development \r\nin the age of rapid technological change”, was a \r\nmoment to dive deep into the implications of artificial \r\nintelligence and other new technological trends that \r\nare shaping our future. The 2018 Multi-stakeholder \r\nForum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the \r\nSDGs addressed global trends and cross-cutting issues, \r\nincluding the impact of rapid technological change on \r\nthe achievement of the SDGs; local and indigenous \r\nknowledge and innovations for the achievement of the \r\nSDGs; and next steps for the Technology Facilitation \r\nMechanism. For its part, the integration segment \r\naddressed the topic of technological change from \r\nthe angle of building innovative communities and \r\nsustainable and resilient societies.\r\nNext, the engagement of stakeholders through \r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the United \r\nNations development system continued to intensify. \r\nThe role of the Economic and Social Council as \r\na platform for multi-stakeholder participation is \r\nunrivalled and was highlighted by the granting during \r\nthe 2018 session of consultative status to some 433 \r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council Youth Forum \r\nsent a strong call for engaging young people in building \r\nsustainable and resilient urban and rural communities. \r\nWe had an unprecedented number of young people and \r\nGovernment ministers, who brought a unique energy \r\nand enthusiasm to the room. We heard young people \r\ntalk about the solutions they can bring to the table and \r\ntheir desire to be more engaged in the work of the United \r\nNations and in the governance of their countries. The \r\n2018 Partnership Forum demonstrated how the inclusion \r\ntargets in the SDGs could be translated into tangible \r\nbusiness goals and make positive impacts in the lives \r\nof women, young people and vulnerable populations.\r\nThe priority of my presidency was to focus on the \r\ntheme “Towards sustainable, resilient and inclusive \r\nsocieties through participation of all”. It led to a special \r\nmeeting of the President of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, which brought together a range of actors to \r\nhighlight the benefits of participatory and inclusive \r\napproaches to implementing the 2030 Agenda. The \r\nmeeting culminated an extensive process that engaged \r\nvarious groups of actors, such as local governments, \r\nbusinesses, non-governmental organizations and \r\nacademia, and included a preparatory meeting \r\nin Prague. I worked closely with major groups and \r\nother stakeholders in organizing the session and the \r\nhigh-level political forum. Each group of stakeholders \r\nwas able to hold side events and identify speakers for \r\nthe forum. Major groups were also able to take charge \r\nof organizing one session. Lastly, the Economic and \r\nSocial Council continued to support the adjustments \r\nneeded to enable the United Nations development \r\nsystem to achieve better results in the changing \r\ndevelopment landscape.\r\nThe 2018 operational activities for development \r\nsegment was the first opportunity for Member States \r\nto consider in depth the proposals of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to reposition the United Nations development \r\nsystem. The deliberations in the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil built common ground for support to the \r\nSecretary-General’s reform proposals to reinvigorate \r\nthe resident coordinator system and to put in place a \r\nbetter funding architecture that improves the quality of \r\nfunding and accountability.\r\nThe 2018 humanitarian affairs segment placed an \r\nunprecedented focus on the poorest and most vulnerable. \r\nIt focused on the theme “Restoring humanity, respecting \r\nhuman dignity and leaving no one behind: working \r\ntogether to reduce people’s humanitarian need, risk \r\nand vulnerability”. It shared experiences, innovations \r\nand best practices from across regions and sectors to \r\nstrengthen coordination of the humanitarian response.\r\nFollowing the devastating hurricanes in the \r\nCaribbean last year, as President I convened a special \r\nmeeting on the theme “Aftermath of recent hurricanes: \r\nachieving a risk-informed and resilient 2030 Agenda”. \r\nTo take stock of progress on the actions contained in \r\nmy presidential statement, the Council is convening \r\na follow-up meeting on “Pathways to resilience in \r\nclimate-affected SIDS” on 13 November.\r\nThe comprehensive report presents all those \r\nitems and others in greater detail. In 2019, the high-\r\nlevel political forum will meet not only in July under \r\nthe auspices of the Economic and Social Council \r\nbut also in September at the summit level under the \r\nauspices of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth \r\nsession, where it will review the entire 2030 Agenda. \r\nIn preparation for that landmark summit, I invite \r\nMembers to draw upon the work of the high-level \r\npolitical forum under the auspices of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and the work of the Economic and Social \r\nA/73/PV.33 05/11/2018\r\n4/4 18-36059\r\nCouncil as a whole in support of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the General \r\nAssembly takes note of the report of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, contained in document A/73/3?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitems 9 and 14.\r\nThe meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.\r\n"
