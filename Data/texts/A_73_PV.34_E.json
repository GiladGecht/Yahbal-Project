"United Nations A/73/PV.34\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n34th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 9 November 2018, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Ke (Cambodia), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 92\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/73/315)\r\nDraft resolution (A/73/L.19)\r\nThe Acting President: Before proceeding, I wish \r\nto advise the Assembly that the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency has informed the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly that he regrets that \r\nhe is unable to attend today’s meeting to introduce the \r\nreport of the Agency for the year 2017 and deliver a \r\nstatement on the developments that have taken place \r\nsince its publication. His prepared statement has been \r\ncirculated in a letter from the President of the General \r\nAssembly and will be issued as an official document \r\n(see A/73/315/Add.1).\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Jordan \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/73/L.19.\r\nMr. Ababneh (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme to begin my statement by expressing our deep \r\ngratitude to Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for \r\nhis briefing contained in the statement that has been \r\ncirculated regarding the main activities of the IAEA \r\n(see A/73/315/Add.1) and for introducing the Agency’s \r\nreport for 2017 (see A/73/315).\r\nThis annual debate is a very important opportunity \r\nfor the General Assembly to assess the tasks and \r\nprincipal activities of the IAEA and stress the great \r\nimportance that the entire international community \r\nattaches to the Agency’s work and its “Atoms for Peace \r\nand Development” mandate. That is clearly highlighted \r\nby the report of the IAEA with regard to implementing \r\nthe safeguards system; facilitating peaceful uses \r\nof nuclear technology; ensuring the safe use of that \r\ntechnology; technical cooperation and capacity-\r\nbuilding; and nuclear security and safety. The Agency \r\nhas managed to strike a successful balance between \r\nall of those activities, thereby contributing not only to \r\nconsolidating international peace and security but also \r\nto achieving several Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nespecially in developing countries.\r\nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, in its capacity \r\nas the President of the IAEA Board of Governors for this \r\nyear, is pleased to introduce to the General Assembly \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.19, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”, whose content \r\nenjoyed consensus from the Agency’s member States \r\nfollowing consultations held in Vienna on 16 October. \r\nIt was also supported here in New York in the meeting \r\nheld on 25 October, to which all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations were invited.\r\nThe draft resolution before the Assembly today \r\nemanates from a basic requirement set out in the IAEA \r\nStatute, as well as a cooperation agreement signed by \r\nthe United Nations and the IAEA in 1957. In conformity \r\nwith the traditional practice, the text of the draft \r\nresolution takes note of the resolutions adopted and \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n18-36857 (E)\r\n*1836857*\r\n \r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n2/26 18-36857\r\ndecisions taken by the Agency’s General Conference \r\nduring its sixty-second regular session and reiterates \r\nthe strong support of the Member States to the IAEA \r\nand its continued activities.\r\nWe hope that the General Assembly will adopt \r\nthe draft resolution by consensus this year, thereby \r\nreflecting the importance of the Agency and its role \r\nas an international instrument and convergence \r\nfocal point.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Kritikos (European Union): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union \r\n(EU). The candidate countries Turkey, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia \r\nand Albania; the country of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidate Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina; the European Free Trade Association \r\ncountry and member of the European Economic Area \r\nLiechtenstein; as well as the Republic of Moldova, \r\nalign themselves with this statement.\r\nWe are pleased to support the draft resolution \r\n(A/73/L.19) on the report (see A/73/315) of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) — a \r\nreport that once again reaffirms the indispensable role \r\nof the Agency with regard to the non-proliferation of \r\nnuclear weapons and in facilitating the development \r\nand practical application of atomic energy for peaceful \r\nuses, as well as in technology transfer and nuclear \r\nverification, safety and security. We also note with \r\nsatisfaction the amount of strong support that has been \r\nexpressed for the Agency’s work.\r\nThe European Union is fully committed to nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament. We reiterate \r\nour firm support for the full, complete and effective \r\nimplementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as the cornerstone of the \r\ninternational non-proliferation regime, the essential \r\nfoundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament, in \r\naccordance with article VI of the NPT, and which we \r\nregard as vital to the further development of nuclear \r\nenergy applications for peaceful purposes. The European \r\nUnion reaffirms its full support for the establishment \r\nof a zone in the Middle East free of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction and their delivery systems and reiterates its \r\nreadiness to assist in the process leading to that goal.\r\nThe IAEA safeguards system is a fundamental \r\ncomponent of the nuclear non-proliferation regime \r\nand plays an indispensable role in the implementation \r\nof the NPT. We underline the primary responsibility \r\nof the Security Council in cases of non-compliance. \r\nThe European Union further recognizes the serious \r\nproliferation challenges that continue to be a threat to \r\ninternational security and the need to find peaceful and \r\ndiplomatic solutions to them.\r\nThe European Union is determined to work with \r\nthe international community to preserve the Joint \r\nComprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement \r\nunanimously endorsed by the Security Council in \r\nresolution 2231 (2015). The EU deeply regrets the \r\nwithdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA and \r\nstresses that as long as Iran continues to implement \r\nits nuclear-related commitments, as confirmed by the \r\nIAEA, the EU will remain committed to the continued \r\nfull and effective implementation of the nuclear deal. \r\nWe call on all parties to implement all parts of the \r\nJCPOA fully and effectively. While welcoming the \r\nongoing implementation, the EU reiterates the need for \r\nIran to continue to abide strictly by all its nuclear-related \r\ncommitments and to cooperate fully and in a timely \r\nmanner with the IAEA, including by implementing the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement and its additional \r\nprotocol, as well as by providing all requested access. \r\nIn that regard, Iran’s early ratification of the additional \r\nprotocol is essential. The European Union fully \r\nsupports the IAEA’s long-term mission of verifying \r\nand monitoring Iran’s nuclear-related commitments and \r\nrecalls the importance of ensuring the necessary means \r\nfor the Agency to carry out its role.\r\nThe recent inter-Korean high-level talks, the \r\nPanmunjom Declaration on Peace, Prosperity and \r\nReunification of the Korean Peninsula and the joint \r\nstatement issued following the summit in Singapore \r\nbetween the United States and the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea are positive steps that can contribute \r\nto easing tensions on the Korean peninsula. While we \r\nsupport those diplomatic efforts, the European Union \r\nurges the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to \r\nengage seriously in the follow-on negotiations and to \r\ntake concrete steps to embark on a credible path towards \r\ncomplete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization \r\nand to maintain its declared suspension of testing \r\nnuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. Until the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea takes those \r\nconcrete steps towards denuclearization, we will \r\n09/11/2018 A/73/PV.34\r\n18-36857 3/26\r\ncontinue to strictly enforce the existing sanctions, \r\nand we call on all States to do the same. We urge the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to comply with \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions, to return to \r\nthe NPT and the IAEA safeguards at an early date and \r\nto sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty without delay. The European Union continues \r\nto attach the highest importance to maintaining an \r\nessential role for the IAEA in verifying the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear programme and \r\nwelcomes and supports the Secretariat’s efforts to \r\nenhance its readiness to do so.\r\nThe European Union urges Syria to cooperate \r\npromptly and transparently with the Agency in order to \r\nresolve all outstanding issues, including by concluding \r\nand implementing an additional protocol as soon \r\nas possible.\r\nThe European Union continues to call for the \r\nuniversalization of the comprehensive safeguards \r\nagreement, together with the additional protocol, \r\nwithout delay. The EU strongly supports the State-level \r\nconcept, as well as the further development and \r\napplication of enhanced capabilities for analytical \r\nservices, information analysis and technologies. \r\nFurthermore, the European Union actively supports \r\nthe Agency’s safeguards system through the European \r\nCommission Safeguards Support Programme, the \r\nInstrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation and Member \r\nState Support Programmes.\r\nThe European Union and its member States attach \r\nthe utmost importance to the worldwide implementation \r\nand continuing improvement of nuclear safety. For \r\nthat reason, a European Union directive has set up a \r\nEuropean system to ensure peer reviews on specific \r\nsafety issues at least every six years. The first such peer \r\nreview, dedicated to the issue of the ageing management \r\nof nuclear power plants and research reactors, has been \r\nrecently completed. The European Union has also \r\nprovided its expertise through so-called stress tests \r\nin a number of neighbouring countries, with a view \r\nto building a more robust, sustainable and transparent \r\nnuclear-safety framework worldwide.\r\nThe European Union stresses the need to continue \r\nto strengthen nuclear security worldwide in order to \r\nprevent nuclear terrorism and the misuse of nuclear \r\nand radioactive material. To that end, we highlight \r\nthe importance of States becoming party to and fully \r\nimplementing the relevant treaties, the Amendment \r\nto the Convention on the Physical Protection of \r\nNuclear Material and the International Convention \r\nfor the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, \r\nand we underline the importance of Security Council \r\nresolutions 1540 (2004) and 2325 (2016). In the context \r\nof the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction, we actively support international \r\ninitiatives that contribute to strengthening nuclear \r\nsecurity. For the period from 2014 to 2020, the \r\nEuropean Union has dedicated more than €100 million \r\nto the regional Chemical, Biological, Radiological and \r\nNuclear Centres of Excellence Initiative. The European \r\nUnion will actively support the preparation of the \r\ninternational conference on nuclear security to be held \r\nin February 2020.\r\nThe European Union strongly supports the central \r\nrole of the International Atomic Energy Agency in \r\nimproving the global nuclear security framework by \r\nstrengthening international cooperation, offering \r\nadvisory services and providing direct assistance to \r\nmember States. We call on IAEA member States to \r\nensure the availability of sufficient resources for those \r\nservices. Together with its member States, the EU is \r\namong the biggest donors to the IAEA Nuclear Security \r\nFund. The European Union funding to the IAEA has \r\nhelped the Agency to assist countries in upgrading and \r\nensuring the physical protection of selected facilities and \r\nin improving their national regulatory infrastructure.\r\nThe European Union remains firmly committed to \r\nthe benefits of multilateral approaches to the nuclear \r\nfuel cycle and to ensuring that high standards of safety, \r\nsecurity and safeguards are implemented to protect our \r\ncollective non-proliferation interests. The European \r\nUnion has supported the IAEA low-enriched uranium \r\nbank project with approximately €25 million and looks \r\nforward to its full establishment in 2019.\r\nFinally, the European Union and its member States \r\ncontinue to be strong supporters of the IAEA’s Technical \r\nCooperation Programme. The EU is the second-largest \r\ncontributor to the Programme. We fully appreciate the \r\nAgency’s role in promoting the responsible development \r\nof the peaceful applications of nuclear technology, and \r\nwe take positive note of the fact that the IAEA has \r\ncontinued to actively engage in the global dialogue \r\non the Sustainable Development Goals. The European \r\nUnion supports the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and \r\ntechnology, including through technical expertise and \r\nwith an average contribution of €15 million annually. \r\nThe European Union supports the peaceful uses of \r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n4/26 18-36857\r\nnuclear energy and technology, including through \r\ntechnical expertise and with an average contribution of \r\n€15 million per year.\r\nMs. Fedorovich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Republic of Belarus, \r\nI would like to thank Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), for his preparation of the report of the Agency \r\nfor 2017 (see A/73/315).\r\nA focus on sustainable development is an important \r\ndistinguishing feature of international cooperation \r\ntoday. As a founder nation of the IAEA, Belarus \r\nis pleased that the Agency is making a significant \r\ncontribution to achieving the Goals outlined in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. We would like to \r\nemphasize the IAEA’s role in facilitating the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear and radiological technologies. Their \r\ndevelopment and widespread use helps to solve problems \r\nin addressing global challenges from energy and food \r\nsecurity to cancer treatment and the fight against \r\nclimate change. Belarus wholeheartedly supports the \r\nIAEA’s safeguards system, which is a fundamental part \r\nof the nuclear non-proliferation regime and plays an \r\nirreplaceable role in the implementation of the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \r\nIn our view it is particularly important to ensure that \r\nthe process of improving the safeguards mechanism \r\ncontinues to be clear, objective and based on the rights \r\nand obligations of the parties in accordance with their \r\nsafeguard agreements.\r\nThe IAEA’s Technical Cooperation Programme \r\nis the mechanism through which the provisions of \r\narticle IV of the NPT are effectively implemented and \r\none of the most important aspects of the Agency’s \r\nimplementation of the role assigned to it with regard \r\nto implementing the Treaty. For Belarus, the Technical \r\nCooperation Programme has become a concrete source \r\nof support in solving problems of socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment. With its help, we have been successfully \r\ndealing with issues of sustainable development in the \r\nareas affected by the Chernobyl disaster for almost \r\nthree decades. The IAEA’s technical cooperation has \r\nalso made a significant contribution to the achievement \r\nof our national nuclear-medicine programmes.\r\nBelarus shares the view that for the foreseeable \r\nfuture nuclear energy will keep its position and \r\npotential for development. We welcome the IAEA’s \r\nsteps aimed at assisting member States in making \r\nconsidered decisions regarding the establishment and \r\ndevelopment of national nuclear-energy programmes. \r\nThe cooperation between Belarus and the IAEA \r\nin this area has evolved since the early days of the \r\nimplementation of our national programme. We have \r\nmade active use of the entire range of the Agency’s \r\ninstruments, from technical cooperation projects to \r\nexpert missions and peer reviews. The nuclear accidents \r\nat Chernobyl and Fukushima have emphasized that \r\nissues related to ensuring nuclear safety are top \r\npriorities, and we welcome the Agency’s increasingly \r\nsignificant contribution to creating reliable nuclear-\r\nsafety infrastructure all over the world. We commend \r\nthe IAEA’s work on strengthening and universalizing \r\nthe relevant conventions and in developing and \r\nimproving standards and technical documents. The \r\nsecretariat’s work in providing advisory services and \r\nconducting independent peer reviews in interested \r\nStates is extremely important.\r\nBelarus supports draft resolution A/73/L.19, on \r\nthe report of the IAEA, and has sponsored the draft \r\ntext in a sign of its support for the Agency’s activities \r\nin promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and \r\nstrengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nMr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian delegation thanks Mr. Yukiya \r\nAmano, Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), for his presentation of the \r\nreport (see A/73/315) on the Agency’s work. Our \r\ncountry was present at the Agency’s creation. We have \r\nalways supported it, and we value its activities during \r\nthe reporting period. We hope that the IAEA will \r\ncontinue to increase its efforts in the interests of the \r\ndevelopment of atomic energy and technologies all over \r\nthe world and the expansion of international cooperation \r\nin those areas, while improving and strengthening the \r\nnuclear-weapon non-proliferation regime.\r\nThe uniqueness of the IAEA verification \r\nmechanism enables it to be highly effective in \r\nmonitoring States’ fulfilment of their non-proliferation \r\ncommitments. One of the central achievements in \r\nthat regard is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \r\n(JCPOA), on the Iranian nuclear programme. To date, \r\nIran remains the country that has been most subject to \r\nverification by the IAEA. The Agency has established \r\nand maintained an exceedingly complex verification \r\nmechanism and is dealing effectively with the tasks \r\ninvolved, enabling it to monitor Tehran’s fulfilment \r\nof its obligations under the JCPOA and of its existing \r\n09/11/2018 A/73/PV.34\r\n18-36857 5/26\r\nsafeguards. The Director General’s reports regularly \r\nconfirm that Tehran is meeting its obligations under \r\nthe JCPOA in addition to its implementation of the \r\nAdditional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement. We \r\nreaffirm our firm commitment to the JCPOA, which \r\nrepresents a carefully calibrated balance of the interests \r\nof the parties and should be strictly implemented. We \r\nprovide various forms of support to the Agency with \r\nregard to Iran, including organizing targeted training \r\ncourses for IAEA inspectors. We emphasize that we are \r\ndeeply concerned about the irresponsible actions of the \r\nUnited States regarding the JCPOA, which are aimed at \r\nundermining this multilateral international agreement \r\nsupported by the Security Council.\r\nWe welcome the emerging positive momentum \r\nwith regard to resolving the Korean peninsula’s \r\nnuclear problem. In the context of the IAEA, we \r\nshould point out that the Agency’s mandate does \r\nnot permit its resources to be used in verifying the \r\ndismantling of nuclear weapons or military nuclear \r\ninfrastructure. However, we welcome the work of the \r\nIAEA secretariat in maintaining its readiness for a \r\nresumption of the application of safeguards throughout \r\nthe Korean peninsula.\r\nThe Russian Federation is in favour of improving \r\nthe Agency’s monitoring capabilities, including in \r\nfuture by converting the additional protocols to IAEA \r\nsafeguards agreements into a universally recognized \r\nstandard for verifying non-proliferation obligations. \r\nWhatever reforms of the Agency’s safeguards system \r\nare undertaken, the mechanism for their application \r\nshould continue to be objective, depoliticized, \r\ntechnically based, comprehensible to member States \r\nand based on the rights and obligations of the parties \r\nin accordance with their safeguards agreements. An \r\nunbiased, objective approach to nuclear verification \r\nis a key element in ensuring the stability of the IAEA \r\ncomprehensive safeguards system and of the nuclear-\r\nweapon non-proliferation regime in general.\r\nRussia actively participates in the Agency’s \r\nactivities as a financial donor, including through \r\nvoluntary contributions to the IAEA’s International \r\nProject on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel \r\nCycles, the Technical Cooperation Fund and the \r\nNuclear Security Fund, as well as in support of the \r\nimplementation of Agency projects in the area of \r\nnuclear infrastructure development. At the moment our \r\nannual extra-budgetary contributions in support of the \r\nIAEA are comparable to our payments to the Agency’s \r\nregular budget.\r\nWe wholeheartedly support the IAEA’s efforts in \r\nthe field of technical cooperation and the provision of \r\nrelated assistance to developing countries, and, for our \r\npart, we actively promote the development of atomic \r\nenergy in other countries. In 2017 and 2018 we signed \r\nagreements on peaceful nuclear cooperation with \r\nBangladesh, Zambia, Kazakhstan, Cambodia, China, \r\nParaguay, the Sudan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In \r\nthat regard, I would like to point out that we in Russia \r\nhave a functioning international centre for uranium \r\nenrichment, which we invite all States developing \r\natomic energy and abiding by their non-proliferation \r\ncommitments to participate in. Russia is also building a \r\nmultipurpose fast research reactor at our State Research \r\nInstitute for Nuclear Reactors. We invite all interested \r\ncountries to participate in our international research \r\ncentre at the Institute.\r\nThe Russian Federation supports the work of the \r\nAgency in the area of physical nuclear security. We \r\nfirmly believe that the responsibility for ensuring such \r\nsecurity on individual States’ territories belongs to the \r\nStates themselves, which should use their discretion in \r\ndetermining the optimal parameters for their national \r\nsystems and measures. We stress the IAEA’s central \r\nrole in international cooperation on nuclear security \r\nand its active participation in organizing contacts \r\nand sharing experiences between interested States. \r\nWe deem it important to ensure the broadest possible \r\nparticipation by States in the international agreements \r\non nuclear security, the Convention on the Physical \r\nProtection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities \r\nand the International Convention for the Suppression \r\nof Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Russia has signed \r\nand ratified those international agreements, and we \r\ncall on States that have not yet done so to accelerate \r\ntheir internal procedures for acceding to those major \r\ninternational instruments.\r\nWe emphasize the need for ensuring a cautious \r\napproach to the IAEA on the part of its member States. \r\nIt is important to refrain from artificial involvement \r\nin the agenda of the Agency’s governing bodies or \r\nin its activities in general beyond the scope of its \r\nStatute, including nuclear-disarmament issues. Given \r\nthe importance of the Agency’s work in the interests \r\nof expanding the peaceful use of atomic power and \r\nstrengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime, the \r\nRussian delegation supports draft resolution A/73/L.19, \r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n6/26 18-36857\r\nentitled “Report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency”, and is one of its sponsors.\r\nMr. Horne (Australia): Australia commends \r\nDirector General Amano for his report (see A/73/315) \r\non the activities of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) and is pleased to continue its \r\nco-sponsorship of draft resolution A/73/L.19.\r\nThe report outlines what has been another productive \r\nyear for the IAEA. Australia greatly values the Agency’s \r\nwork across nuclear science and technology, safety, \r\nsecurity, safeguards and technical cooperation. Last \r\nyear we celebrated the Agency’s sixtieth anniversary. \r\nAs we noted then, these themes are just as relevant and \r\nimportant today as they were at the very beginning. \r\nGoing forward, Australia welcomes the Director \r\nGeneral’s commitment to championing gender equality \r\nin particular. We will continue to strongly support and \r\nadvocate for efforts to increase the representation of \r\nwomen in technical areas and in the Agency’s senior \r\nmanagement, particularly through the Group of Friends \r\nfor Women in Nuclear, now established in Vienna.\r\nAustralia remains a strong supporter of the \r\ntransfer of knowledge and expertise through the IAEA \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme and is pleased \r\nto be providing extra-budgetary contributions to the \r\nPeaceful Uses Initiative. We are proud to be providing \r\nthose funds for the modernization of the nuclear-\r\napplication laboratories at Seibersdorf, Austria, and for \r\nthe renewal project.\r\nAustralia is firmly committed to nuclear safety \r\nand security and this week is undergoing an Integrated \r\nRegulatory Review Service mission, demonstrating our \r\nsustained commitment to the international peer review \r\nsystem and to continuing improvement in regulating \r\nnuclear and radiation safety. That also follows the \r\nsuccessful completion of a follow-up mission of the \r\nInternational Physical Protection Advisory Service held \r\nin Australia in November 2017. The IAEA continues to \r\nplay a key coordinating role in assisting Member States \r\nin enhancing nuclear security. The global importance \r\nof nuclear security and of the IAEA’s role was \r\nre-emphasized at the IAEA’s successful International \r\nConference on Nuclear Security in December 2016, \r\nwhich attracted more than 2,100 participants from \r\n139 member States. We look forward to the next \r\nConference, to be held in 2020. We also commend the \r\nIAEA’s continued outreach on the amended Convention \r\non the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and \r\nNuclear Facilities and call on States to make suitable \r\npreparations for the Review Conference of the amended \r\nConvention in 2021.\r\nThe Australian Government remains committed \r\nto the complete, verifiable and irreversible \r\ndenuclearization of North Korea. We welcome the \r\nongoing dialogue between North Korea and both the \r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States. We note North \r\nKorea’s commitment to halting nuclear testing and \r\nallowing international inspections of the Punggye-ri \r\nnuclear test site and the Tongchang-ri missile site. \r\nWhile we see those commitments as positive, we \r\nremain committed to maintaining pressure on North \r\nKorea until it takes concrete steps towards complying \r\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions on its \r\nnuclear and ballistic-missile programmes.\r\nAustralia thanks Jordan for introducing the draft \r\nresolution. We look forward to contributing to the \r\nIAEA’s continued successes in the years to come.\r\nMs. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): Let me begin \r\nby welcoming Mr. Yukiya Amano’s reappointment \r\nas Director General at the helm of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), attesting to the trust \r\nthat member States place in his leadership.\r\nAs the annual report (see A/73/315) presented \r\nto us today points out, it is important to recall the \r\nAgency’s goal, as stated in article II of its Statute, to \r\nenlarge, “the contribution of atomic energy to peace, \r\nhealth and prosperity throughout the world”, and \r\ncall attention to its motto — “Atoms for Peace and \r\nDevelopment” — which represents the essential nature \r\nof its mission in a few words.\r\nIn a turbulent world, where our States are often \r\ndealing with a number of simultaneous and cumulative \r\nchallenges, the role of the Agency remains central. On \r\nthe one hand, it must confront security challenges such \r\nas nuclear proliferation and ensure that State guarantees \r\nare respected, while on the other, its programmes make \r\na significant contribution to development. Access to \r\nsafe, affordable and low-greenhouse-gas-emission \r\nenergy, the use of nuclear techniques in agriculture, \r\nsoil erosion and especially nuclear applications in \r\nhealth care contribute directly to the achievement of \r\nSustainable Development Goals 7, 2 and 3, respectively. \r\nSo while the general public may not always be aware \r\nof all of the applications of nuclear technology and the \r\npositive contribution that peaceful uses of the atom \r\nmake to daily life, the Agency plays a role as a major \r\n09/11/2018 A/73/PV.34\r\n18-36857 7/26\r\nguarantor of international security and an important \r\nfactor in sustainable development.\r\nThe Scientific Forum held at IAEA headquarters \r\nin September, this year devoted to the theme “Nuclear \r\ntechnology for climate: mitigation, monitoring and \r\nadaptation”, was particularly timely given that climate \r\nchange affects all of us without exception, and certain \r\ncountries with violent intensity. The IAEA’s work can \r\nhelp us reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and assess \r\nthe effects of climate change through the application \r\nof nuclear techniques for scientific research and \r\nclimate preservation. The Assembly can rest assured \r\nthat Monaco will continue to support the Agency, \r\nincluding through its Programme of Action for Cancer \r\nTherapy, whose goal is improving the effectiveness of \r\nradiological medicine in the fight against cancer, and \r\nwhich has enjoyed the support of our Government \r\nfor a decade. We also share with the Agency a deep \r\ncommitment to science and to cooperation, which \r\nshould help us to respond to States’ aspirations to \r\ncontribute to sustainable development and improve \r\ntheir citizens’ quality of life.\r\nIn the area of marine scientific research, for \r\nexample, the Agency has developed new analytical \r\nmethods and conducted environmental studies aimed at \r\nimproving our understanding of the movements of toxic \r\ncontaminants — mercury, lead and so forth — and \r\ntheir effects on coastal and marine ecosystems. The \r\ncooperation between Monaco and the Agency dates \r\nback to 1961, when the IAEA International Laboratory \r\nof Marine Radioactivity, the first of its kind, was \r\nestablished within the Musée océanographique \r\nde Monaco. The laboratories set up in Monaco \r\nwere initially specifically dedicated to the marine \r\nenvironment and carried out scientific research both \r\nin the laboratory and on the world’s oceans and seas \r\nwith a view to assessing the impact of human activities \r\non marine species and gathering data. Monaco has \r\nhosted the IAEA Environment Laboratories at their \r\ncurrent location, employing more than 40 people, for \r\nthe past 20 years. That anniversary was celebrated in \r\nthe Principality last month, with the Deputy Director \r\nGeneral of the IAEA and Head of the Department of \r\nNuclear Sciences and Applications present.\r\nIn 2012, the Agency also established the Ocean \r\nAcidification International Coordination Centre within \r\nthe Environment Laboratories on the same premises. \r\nAs a direct consequence of the increase of carbon \r\ndioxide in the atmosphere, ocean acidification has a \r\nsignificant and devastating impact on the many marine \r\nspecies that form a shell or a calcareous skeleton, such \r\nas crustaceans and corals.\r\nThe IAEA, its International Coordination Centre \r\nand the Scientific Centre of Monaco organize regular \r\ninternational workshops in the Principality on the \r\nsocioeconomic impacts of ocean acidification. After \r\nassessing the situation, studying the implications for \r\nfisheries and aquaculture and looking at the impacts \r\non coastal populations, the fourth such workshop, held \r\nin October 2017, focused on the effects on coral reefs.\r\nIn conclusion, this year Monaco once again \r\nexpresses its full confidence in the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency and is pleased to continue to \r\nco-sponsor draft resolution A/73/L.19.\r\nMs. Chuchotthavorn (Thailand): Thailand wishes \r\nto express its sincere appreciation to Mr. Yukiya Amano, \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), for his statement (see A/73/315/Add.1) \r\npresenting the Agency’s report for 2017 (see A/73/315). \r\nWe also thank Jordan, in its capacity as Chair of the \r\nBoard of Governors, for facilitating draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.19.\r\nThe IAEA has always played a crucial role \r\nin promoting the peaceful applications of nuclear \r\ntechnology. Its work to strengthen nuclear safety, \r\nsecurity and safeguards has contributed greatly to \r\nglobal security and development. Against the current \r\ninternational security background and challenges, \r\nthe IAEA continues to play an essential role in \r\nupholding the principles of nuclear disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation. Thailand fully supports and \r\ncommends the Agency’s commitment to monitoring \r\nand verification under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \r\nAction, as well as its readiness to verify the nuclear \r\nprogramme of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea.\r\nFor our part, we wish to highlight that during \r\n2018, Thailand ratified and acceded to a number \r\nof treaties under the auspices of the IAEA. They \r\ninclude the Convention on the Physical Protection of \r\nNuclear Material and its Amendment, the Convention \r\non Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the \r\nSafety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of \r\nRadioactive Waste Management. That is clear testament \r\nto our determination to fulfil international obligations \r\nand commitments.\r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n8/26 18-36857\r\nThailand values the close relationship with the \r\nAgency and has benefited greatly from the Agency \r\nthrough technical cooperation and assistance \r\nprogrammes. This year, the IAEA designated the \r\nThailand Institute of Nuclear Technology as an IAEA \r\nCollaborating Centre on water resources assessment and \r\nmanagement. We have also hosted 19 IAEA capacity-\r\nbuilding activities, which covered various areas such \r\nas sterile insect technique, cancer control, nuclear \r\nsafety and radiation technology. Such activities and \r\nengagement between the Agency and member States \r\nreflect its positive contributions to the attainment of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals by all States. Thailand \r\nlooks forward to continuing that close relationship \r\nwith the Agency and stands ready to explore further \r\npotential areas of collaboration. As a member of the \r\nBoard of Governors for the period from 2018 to 2020, \r\nwe are determined to work closely and constructively \r\nwith all parties in advancing the work of the Agency.\r\nIn conclusion, Thailand reaffirms its continued \r\nsupport for the draft resolution, and we are pleased to \r\nco-sponsor it.\r\nMr. Benshaban (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation would like to thank Mr. Amano, Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), for the report of the IAEA for 2017 (see \r\nA/73/315), as well as for his statement presenting the \r\nreport, which contains complementary information on \r\nthe main developments in the activities of the Agency \r\n(see A/73/315/Add.1). My delegation attentively \r\ntook note of the report, which reflects the important \r\nrole played by the IAEA in enhancing international \r\ncooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy and \r\nin continuing to provide technical assistance and the \r\nnecessary support to member States based on their \r\nrequests to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\r\nMy delegation encourages the IAEA to continue \r\nto carry out its activities in a balanced manner that \r\nmeets the needs of member States in the area of \r\nnuclear technology to achieve effective socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment. We also commend the efforts of the \r\nAgency to support member States in implementing \r\ntheir development projects in line with the Agency’s \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme. We call on all \r\nMember States to continue to support the Programme \r\nand the Agency’s other monitoring and verification \r\nprogrammes. Strengthening the Agency’s safeguards \r\nregime should not adversely affect technical cooperation \r\nand assistance.\r\nWe are concerned about the fact that some nuclear-\r\nweapon States have adopted  a policy of restricting the \r\ntransfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes \r\nin clear violation of article IV of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). That \r\nobstructs technical cooperation programmes and \r\nundermines the basis of the NPT, particularly in terms \r\nof denuclearization, nuclear non-proliferation and the \r\ninalienable right of member States to the peaceful use \r\nof nuclear energy.\r\nAt the national level, we highly commend the \r\nvaluable cooperation carried out with my country \r\nin recent years, especially in the areas of human \r\nhealth, underground water resources management and \r\ninsect pest control, which are some of the priorities \r\nof our national programme to meet the country’s \r\nsocioeconomic needs and development requirements. \r\nMy country is committed to the Agency’s orientation \r\nand will therefore submit fewer but more substantive \r\nprojects within the specific priorities of the national \r\nprogramme. In that regard, we submitted seven \r\nproposals pertaining to technical assistance projects \r\nfor the period from 2020 to 2021, six of which \r\nwere accepted.\r\nIn conclusion, we express our readiness to continue \r\nto cooperate with the IAEA and Member States to ensure \r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy. We look forward to \r\nstrengthening the Agency’s role in the verification of \r\nnuclear denuclearization, given its technical capability, \r\nintegrity and indisputable professional competence, \r\nas well as its legitimate mandate. The adoption of \r\nthe Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in \r\n2017 constituted a clear demonstration of the robust \r\ncommitment by the vast majority of the international \r\ncommunity to denuclearization. We hope that the IAEA \r\nand Member States will meet such aspirations.\r\nMr. Ntsoane (South Africa): We welcome the \r\nremarks made by the representative of Jordan at the \r\noutset of today’s proceedings, which ably underscore \r\nthe importance of the General Assembly and its role \r\nin the world today. I would also like to convey my \r\ndelegation’s sincere appreciation to the Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), Mr. Yukiya Amano, for his statement (see \r\nA/73/351/Add.1) presenting the IAEA’s report for 2017 \r\n(see A/73/315) and for providing valuable updates on \r\nthe Agency’s activities in 2018.\r\n09/11/2018 A/73/PV.34\r\n18-36857 9/26\r\nWe are pleased that the IAEA Board of Governors \r\ncontinues to place greater emphasis on the development \r\nrole of the IAEA through its activities related to nuclear \r\nscience, technology and applications. Together with \r\nother Member States, South Africa will continue to \r\nadvocate for a balanced approach to the implementation \r\nof the IAEA mandate, in line with its motto, “Atoms for \r\nPeace and Development”.\r\nSouth Africa fully supports the priorities and \r\nwork of the IAEA, including the progress achieved \r\nby the Agency during in 2017. In that regard, South \r\nAfrica has always maintained that the Agency’s \r\nnuclear applications in areas such as agriculture and \r\ncrop production, food security, human health, water-\r\nresource management, nuclear technology and animal \r\nhealth contribute to the socioeconomic development of \r\ndeveloping countries — especially those in Africa — and \r\nassist them immensely in their efforts to implement the \r\n2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nIn that context, South Africa reiterates the support \r\nvoiced by many Member States for the IAEA to continue \r\nassisting developing countries, particularly in Africa, \r\nto enhance the benefits that could be derived from \r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology. \r\nSouth Africa, for its part, has immensely benefitted \r\nfrom IAEA scientific and technological support, not \r\nleast in the strengthening of the clinical management \r\nof oncological, neurological and cardiovascular \r\ndiseases. The IAEA also supported South Africa in \r\nthe development of the sterile insect technique to help \r\ncontrol malaria.\r\nFurthermore, South Africa wishes to underscore the \r\ncentral role played by the Agency in implementing its \r\nsafeguards verification system, which plays an essential \r\nrole in verifying the peaceful nature of nuclear energy \r\nprogrammes. As the only country to have voluntarily \r\ndismantled its nuclear weapons programme, carried \r\nout with the assistance and guidance of the IAEA, \r\nSouth Africa can attest to the indispensable role of the \r\nAgency’s safeguards system.\r\nIn addition to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, \r\nSouth Africa believes that nuclear disarmament and \r\nnuclear non-proliferation are mutually reinforcing \r\nprocesses. Therefore, progress on all the pillars of the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is \r\nessential to realizing the IAEA’s object and purpose.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation has co-sponsored \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.19, submitted by Jordan in its \r\ncapacity as the Chair of the Board of Governors for \r\nthe term 2018-2019. The draft resolution, inter alia, \r\nreaffirms the indispensable role played by the Agency \r\nin encouraging and assisting the development and \r\npractical application of atomic energy for peaceful \r\nuses, in technology transfer to developing countries \r\nand in nuclear safety, verification and security. In that \r\nregard, we appreciate Jordan’s coordinating role.\r\nMr. Carrillo Gómez (Paraguay) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): It is an honour to deliver this statement on \r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Republic of Paraguay. We \r\nappreciate the introduction of the report (see A/73/315) \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and \r\nreaffirm our confidence that the Agency will ensure \r\nthat atomic energy contributes to global peace, health \r\nand prosperity, as prescribed by its Statute.\r\nThe delegation of Paraguay stresses the importance \r\nof the nuclear security and verification activities of \r\nthe IAEA, whose assistance must not be perverted \r\nto contribute to military ends or to undermine \r\ninternational peace and security. The Republic of \r\nParaguay reiterates its commitment to the provisions \r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\nand the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, \r\nand welcomes the progress made and initiatives \r\nundertaken by the IAEA in the fields of disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation, particularly in the Middle East \r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Our \r\ndelegation calls on all Member States to support and \r\nfacilitate the Agency’s verification and monitoring \r\nsystem for the application of safeguards.\r\nParaguay has worked intensively  to strengthen its \r\ncoordination with the IAEA to regulate and control the \r\npeaceful and beneficial use of ionizing radiation sources \r\nand nuclear energy. Over the past year, Paraguay has \r\nincorporated into its national legal system the Small \r\nQuantities Protocols Amendments to the Agreement \r\nbetween the Republic of Paraguay and the IAEA for \r\nthe Application of Safeguards in connection with the \r\n1978 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons \r\nin Latin America and the Treaty, which stipulates the \r\nneed to notify the IAEA, in a timely manner, about \r\nthe possession of nuclear materials by Paraguay \r\nand the planning of nuclear facilities in Paraguayan \r\njurisdiction. Paraguay has also incorporated into its \r\nnational legal system the 1997 Joint Convention on the \r\nSafety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety \r\nof Radioactive Waste Management, which regulates \r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n10/26 18-36857\r\naspects of the safety of spent fuel and radioactive \r\nwaste management.\r\nWe emphasize that the development of programmes \r\nfor the peaceful use of nuclear energy and their \r\nimplementation should be carried out with transparency, \r\nunder the guidance and supervision of the IAEA, taking \r\nevery possible precaution and limiting the potential \r\nharm that the production of nuclear energy could cause \r\nto the environment and to human health. States that \r\ncarry out such programmes on their territories should \r\ndo so on the basis of broad cross-border responsibility, \r\nadhering to best practices in international cooperation, \r\nrisk prevention and due diligence, and responding \r\nappropriately to possible transboundary damages.\r\nFinally, the delegation of Paraguay underlines \r\nthe role of technical assistance and international \r\ncooperation for developing countries such as the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay, especially in developing and \r\nstrengthening national capacities for the peaceful use \r\nof atomic energy in the framework of efforts to achieve \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals. It therefore calls \r\nfor enhancing the multilateral debate on the peaceful \r\nuse of atomic energy and on disarmament and nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation in all its aspects, within the framework \r\nof the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and respect for international law.\r\nMr. Sun Lei (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation thanks Mr. Yukiya Amano,  Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) for his presentation (see A/73/315/Add.1) of the \r\nAgency’s report (see A/73/315).\r\nOver the past year, the Agency has effectively \r\nimplemented the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange in accordance with its obligation under the \r\nAgency’s statute to make progress in promoting the \r\ndevelopment of nuclear energy and nuclear technology \r\nby Member States, improving global nuclear security \r\nand safety, and safeguarding nuclear non-proliferation. \r\nChina commends those efforts.\r\nWith their growing momentum and wider use, \r\nnuclear energy and nuclear technology are playing an \r\nincreasingly important role in ensuring energy security, \r\nhelping adaptation to climate change and achieving \r\nsustainable development. Meanwhile, the international \r\nnuclear security and nuclear non-proliferation situation \r\nremains grim. The risk of nuclear terrorism cannot be \r\nignored, and global governance in the nuclear field \r\nremains an uphill battle. China hopes that the Agency \r\nwill steadfastly adhere to the purpose of atoms for peace \r\nand development and focus on the following tasks.\r\nFirst, it must promote the development of nuclear \r\nenergy and the application of nuclear technology. The \r\nAgency should continue to increase its contribution to \r\npromoting international exchanges and cooperation in \r\nnuclear energy and technology, and prioritize technical \r\ncooperation as a channel of support and assistance to \r\nnuclear-energy development and nuclear-technology \r\napplications in developing countries, so that all \r\ncountries can benefit from nuclear energy.\r\nSecondly, the IAEA must improve the safeguards \r\nregime. The Agency should commit to safeguarding \r\nthe international nuclear non-proliferation regime, \r\nwith the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) as its cornerstone, and continue to \r\nenhance the universality, effectiveness and efficiency \r\nof the safeguards system, while ensuring objectivity \r\nand fairness. It is hoped that the IAEA secretariat will \r\ncontinue to engage closely with Member States on \r\nnational safeguards.\r\nThirdly, the Agency must strengthen global \r\nnuclear-energy safety and nuclear security. China \r\nsupports the Agency’s ongoing efforts to promote the \r\nimplementation of the nuclear security plan, nuclear-\r\nenergy safety standards and nuclear-security guidelines, \r\nto assist Member States in capacity-building, to \r\npromote international and regional cooperation and to \r\ncontribute to building a fair, cooperative and win-win \r\ninternational nuclear-safety system.\r\nFourthly, the Agency must address regional hotspot \r\nnuclear issues in an impartial and objective manner. \r\nChina appreciates the Agency’s efforts to facilitate \r\nthe implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan \r\nof Action, which is conducive to the maintenance of \r\nthe NPT, contributes to peace and security in the \r\nMiddle East and is hence in the common interest of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nChina supports the fulfilment of the Agency’s \r\nmonitoring and verifications mandate. As such, it has \r\ndecided to contribute an additional ¥1.5 million to the \r\nAgency. China welcomes the recent progress on the \r\nKorean peninsula and supports and encourages all \r\nrelevant parties’ efforts to achieve denuclearization and \r\nlasting peace and prosperity on the peninsula. China \r\nalso supports the Agency in the playing of its due role \r\n09/11/2018 A/73/PV.34\r\n18-36857 11/26\r\nin applying safeguards in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, pursuant to its mandate.\r\nThe Chinese Government attaches great importance \r\nto the development of nuclear energy and consistently \r\nupholds the rational, coordinated and balanced \r\nnuclear safety concept put forward by President Xi \r\nJinping, adheres to the principle of safety first and \r\nmaintains a good nuclear-safety record. In January, \r\nChina promulgated and implemented a nuclear-safety \r\nlaw that provides a further solid guarantee for the \r\nsafe and sustainable development of China’s nuclear \r\nenergy. China supports and actively participates in \r\nrelevant international cooperation endeavours in the \r\nfield of nuclear energy and stands ready to continue \r\nto strengthen overall cooperation with the Agency \r\nthrough the China Center of Excellence on Nuclear \r\nSecurity and the China Customs Radiation Detection \r\nTraining Center. China is ready to carry out exchanges \r\nand training programmes with all parties with a view \r\nto making its due contribution to the promotion of the \r\nhealthy and safe development of nuclear energy in the \r\nAsia-Pacific region and the world.\r\nMr. Bessho (Japan): The Government of Japan \r\nhighly commends Director General Amano’s work \r\nin addressing and promoting the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy and nuclear non-proliferation. Japan \r\nwill continue to fully support the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) and invites all Member States \r\nto do likewise.\r\nPromoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy \r\nis one of the three pillars of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Japan supports \r\nAtoms for Peace and Development, an initiative \r\nundertaken by Director General Amano, as it contributes \r\nto achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nJapan will serve as co-Chair of the IAEA Ministerial \r\nConference on Nuclear Science and Technology, which \r\nwill open on 28 November. I would like to request \r\nthe support of Member States for the success of the \r\nupcoming Conference.\r\nIn order to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy, it is essential that we strengthen the existing \r\nsafeguards that ensure nuclear safety and security. \r\nIAEA safeguards are an essential instrument for \r\nnuclear non-proliferation. Japan therefore advocates \r\nthe universalization of the additional protocols to the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement with a view \r\nto strengthening those safeguards. Japan has been \r\nstriving to help universalize the additional protocols \r\nand make the safeguards more effective and efficient, \r\nincluding by contributing to the success of the IAEA \r\nSymposium on International Safeguards, which was \r\nheld in November, as well as the Asia Senior-Level \r\nTalks on Non-Proliferation and the Asia-Pacific \r\nSafeguards Network.\r\nOver the past seven years, Japan has actively worked \r\nto enhance nuclear safety, drawing on the lessons \r\nlearned from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power \r\nplant accident, including by fundamentally reforming \r\nthe country’s regulatory structures. Japan will continue \r\nto share its experiences from the accident with the \r\ninternational community and contribute to enhancing \r\nnuclear safety worldwide, including by assisting in the \r\ndevelopment of infrastructure and human resources in \r\ncountries introducing new nuclear power plants.\r\nNuclear security is another key area of Japan’s focus. \r\nIn view of the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, to \r\nbe held in Tokyo, Japan and the IAEA signed practical \r\narrangements on cooperation in nuclear-security \r\nmeasures this year. On the basis of the arrangements, \r\nJapan will step up collaborative efforts with the IAEA \r\nto increase readiness to counter nuclear terrorism.\r\nAs for North Korea, at the Summit between the \r\nUnited States and North Korea in June, Chairman \r\nKim Jong Un’s intention to completely denuclearize \r\nthe Korean peninsula was reaffirmed in the form \r\nof a document. Japan supports this step towards the \r\ncomprehensive resolution of the outstanding issues of \r\nconcern regarding North Korea. Japan reaffirms its \r\nstrong commitment to working with the international \r\ncommunity to achieve the complete, verifiable and \r\nirreversible dismantlement of all North Korea’s nuclear \r\nweapons, existing nuclear programmes and related \r\nfacilities, in accordance with the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions. Japan calls on North Korea to take \r\nconcrete steps towards denuclearization.\r\nThe international community needs to come \r\ntogether to support the process between the United \r\nStates and North Korea. We emphasize the critical \r\nimportance of all States fully implementing the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, and we call on \r\nthem to continue working collectively to that end. The \r\nIAEA Director General’s recent report notes that North \r\nKorea is continuing its nuclear programme. Japan calls \r\nfor cooperation from the international community to \r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n12/26 18-36857\r\nassist the IAEA in playing a key role in addressing that \r\nimportant issue.\r\nLastly, let me briefly say a word on the Joint \r\nComprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Japan supports \r\nthe JCPOA, which contributes to regional stability and \r\nto strengthening the international non-proliferation \r\nregime. Japan commends the IAEA’s essential role in \r\nthe monitoring and verification of the JCPOA.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate, on behalf of \r\nmy Government, Japan’s firm commitment to further \r\npromoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and \r\nstrengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nMs. Chan (Singapore): Singapore thanks Director \r\nGeneral Yukiya Amano for the comprehensive annual \r\nreport (see A/73/315) of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA). We are pleased to once again \r\nsponsor this year’s draft resolution (A/73/L.19) on the \r\nAgency’s report.\r\nAllow me to make several points on the work of \r\nthe IAEA.\r\nFirst, Singapore has been an active member of the \r\nIAEA since the Agency’s establishment in 1957 and has \r\nbenefited from the Agency’s expertise and knowledge. \r\nWe have been privileged to serve on the IAEA Board \r\nof Governors for the past two years. During its tenure, \r\nSingapore has actively contributed to discussions on \r\nnuclear safety and security. We have advocated for the \r\nIAEA to enhance its nuclear-safety guidance documents \r\nand to ensure that they remain current with the latest \r\ninnovations in nuclear technology, in particular \r\nthose related to small and medium-sized or modular \r\nreactors and transportable nuclear-power plants. We \r\nhave underscored the importance of strengthening \r\nnuclear security and supported the IAEA’s efforts to \r\ndevelop nuclear-security guidance on computer and \r\ninformation security through the Nuclear Security \r\nGuidance Committee.\r\nSecondly, Singapore has consistently called for \r\nthe IAEA to provide sufficient technical assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries, in particular small States and \r\nleast developed countries, to help them achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. The IAEA Ministerial \r\nConference on Nuclear Science and Technology, which \r\nwill take place in Vienna later this month, will be an \r\nopportunity for IAEA member States to discuss the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear science and technology and \r\ntheir contribution to sustainable development.\r\nSingapore continues to make concrete contributions \r\nthrough the enhanced Singapore-IAEA third-country \r\ntraining programme, which was launched by Director \r\nGeneral Amano in Singapore in 2015. Over its past \r\ntwo years as a member of the Board of Governors, \r\nSingapore has conducted regional workshops on topics \r\nsuch as emergency preparedness and response, nuclear \r\nregulatory law and food safety.\r\nThirdly, we welcome the IAEA’s regional \r\npartnerships, which play a crucial role in the \r\nfulfilment of the IAEA motto, “Atoms for Peace and \r\nDevelopment”. In our region, Singapore is this year’s \r\nchair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\nNetwork of Regulatory Bodies on Atomic Energy. In \r\nJune, the Network adopted a five-year work plan that \r\nmapped out the details of critical work areas, such \r\nas the establishment of a harmonized assessment \r\nand decision-making protocol during a nuclear or \r\nradiological emergency. The Network is also working \r\nclosely with the IAEA to finalize the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations-IAEA practical arrangements \r\nto deepen our institutional links and cooperation with \r\nthe IAEA.\r\nFourthly, the IAEA has acquitted itself well over the \r\npast year in dealing with challenging developments in \r\nkey dossiers such as the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea and the verification and monitoring activities \r\nin Iran under Security Council resolution 2231 (2015). \r\nSingapore welcomes the recent positive developments \r\non the Korean peninsula, including the inter-Korean \r\nsummits. We hosted the summit between President \r\nTrump and Chairman Kim in June, which we hope will \r\nbe an important step on the journey towards lasting \r\npeace and stability on the Korean peninsula.\r\nWe welcome the stated commitment of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to complete \r\ndenuclearization and its pledge to refrain from \r\nconducting further nuclear and missile tests. We \r\nurge all concerned parties to continue dialogue and \r\ntake concrete steps to implement the joint statement \r\nof the Singapore summit. We call on the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea to fulfil its international \r\nobligations, including those under the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, and to return to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Singapore takes \r\nits obligations under the relevant Council resolutions \r\nseriously and implements them fully and faithfully.\r\n09/11/2018 A/73/PV.34\r\n18-36857 13/26\r\nWe also note that the IAEA has continued to \r\nverify Iran’s implementation of its nuclear-related \r\ncommitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \r\nAction (JCPOA). The JCPOA plays an important role \r\nin the global nuclear non-proliferation architecture. \r\nWe note that the remaining parties to the JCPOA have \r\nreaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective \r\nimplementation of the agreement, as long as Iran \r\ncontinues to fulfil its nuclear-related commitments. We \r\nurge all remaining parties to continue their dialogue \r\nthrough the Joint Commission and other avenues to \r\nsustain this internationally negotiated agreement.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate Singapore’s \r\nfirm commitment to the work of the IAEA. Although \r\nSingapore has stepped down from the Board of \r\nGovernors, we will continue to play an active and \r\nconstructive role to support the IAEA’s work.\r\nMr. Djani (Indonesia): I will deliver the short \r\nversion of our statement. The complete statement will \r\nbe made available on the PaperSmart portal.\r\nFirst, Indonesia would like to express its appreciation \r\nto the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \r\nDirector General for the Agency’s 2017 report (see \r\nA/73/315) and for his valuable statement (see A/73/315/\r\nAdd.1). We welcome IAEA’s efforts to provide necessary \r\nsupport to Member States and encourage its secretariat \r\nto pursue its programme of work in a balanced manner, \r\nincluding to share the benefits of nuclear science and \r\ntechnology for socioeconomic development.\r\nWe appreciate the Agency’s continued support \r\nIndonesia in, among other things, the development of \r\nIndonesia’s nuclear-energy programme; the revision \r\nprocess of Act No. 10 of 1997, on nuclear energy; \r\nthe management programme of low-activity disused \r\nsealed radioactive sources in the area of management \r\nof radioactive waste and disused sealed radioactive \r\nsources; the national technical cooperation bench-to-\r\nbusiness pilot project on soybeans; and the nuclear- \r\nsecurity measures during the 18th Asian Games and \r\nthe 2018 annual meeting of the International Monetary \r\nFund and the World Bank Group, which was held in \r\nBali and attended by thousands of participants.\r\nFurthermore, Indonesia provides ongoing support to \r\nseveral IAEA programmes, such as the Indonesia-IAEA \r\npractical arrangements, which helps the least developed \r\ncountries establish their safety infrastructure through \r\nthe Agency’s Peaceful Uses initiative. Indonesia also \r\nhosts the annual IAEA Regional School on Nuclear \r\nSecurity for the Asia Pacific region and, in 2017 and \r\n2018, hosted regional training courses for teachers \r\nto introduce nuclear sciences in secondary schools. \r\nIn addition, through the regional capacity-building \r\ninitiative, my country supports IAEA programmes that \r\npromote resource mobilization and the optimized usage \r\nof regional resources for capacity-building.\r\nIndonesia acknowledges and welcomes the many \r\nimportant IAEA activities and programmes, including \r\nthe International Symposium on Plant Mutation \r\nBreeding and Biotechnology, held in August; the \r\nupcoming International Symposium on Understanding \r\nthe Double Burden of Malnutrition for Effective \r\nInterventions, to be held in December; the Renovation \r\nof the Nuclear Applications Laboratories project; as \r\nwell as the Site and External Events Design Review \r\nService and the follow-up Integrated Regulatory \r\nReview Service.\r\nAt this juncture, we would also like to emphasize \r\nthat nuclear-security efforts must be pursued in a \r\ncomprehensive manner that goes beyond ensuring the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear material. Furthermore, such \r\nefforts must not hamper international cooperation in \r\nthe field of peaceful nuclear activities or undermine \r\nthe established priorities of IAEA Technical \r\nCooperation Programme.\r\nIndonesia looks forward to opportunities to further \r\nstrengthen its cooperation with the IAEA in 2019 and \r\nfor many years to come, including in the area of the \r\nmarine environment through the marine radioecology \r\nlaboratory to be established in the north of Java. \r\nFurther, we would appreciate additional support from \r\nthe Agency’s Department of Nuclear Energy and \r\nthe Department of Nuclear Safety and Security to \r\ndevelop capacities related to the management of high-\r\nactivity sources.\r\nFinally, we would emphasize that the purpose \r\nof draft resolution A/73/L.19, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”, is to provide the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations the opportunity \r\nto recognize the activities that IAEA has undertaken \r\nduring the reporting year and to lend their support to \r\nthe Agency’s continuing work. We have sponsored the \r\ndraft resolution and duly hope that it will be adopted \r\nby consensus and contribute to promoting the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy.\r\nMs. Sealey (Jamaica): My delegation is pleased to \r\njoin in the annual debate on agenda item 92, “Report of \r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n14/26 18-36857\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency.” We thank the \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) for his comprehensive statement and \r\ntake this opportunity to highlight a number of issues \r\nthat are of particular importance to Jamaica under \r\nthis item.\r\nFirst, we applaud the work of the IAEA in support \r\nof the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nWe therefore note with great satisfaction that the Agency \r\nnow implements safeguards in more than 180 countries, \r\nwhich confirms that the Agency remains indispensable \r\nto strengthening cooperation in the nuclear field and \r\nto promoting the safe, secure and peaceful use of \r\nnuclear technologies.\r\nSecondly, we continue to be pleased with the \r\nlevel support being extended by the Agency for the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. As we draw closer to 2030, it is fitting that our \r\ncollective efforts should be directed towards ensuring \r\nthe attainment of the Goals, in particular those related \r\nto health, water and sanitation, as well as to sustainable \r\nand modern energy.\r\nThirdly, Jamaica welcomes the fact there continues \r\nto be such a strong focus on capacity-building through \r\ntechnical cooperation. We are deeply appreciative of \r\nthe strong partnership that has been forged over the \r\npast 50 years of being a member of the IAEA and are \r\npleased that it is a partnership that continues to be \r\ndeepened and strengthened. Jamaica currently has nine \r\nactive projects, four of which commenced in January, \r\nunder the 2018-2019 project cycle. Our projects with \r\nthe Agency cover a range of issues and concerns, such \r\nas upgrading the research reactor infrastructure at the \r\nUniversity of the West Indies SLOWPOKE-2 facility; \r\norganizing irrigation water management to improve \r\ncrop output and water quality control; re-establishing \r\nnuclear-medicine capacities; and building capacity \r\nfor cancer diagnosis and treatment services related to \r\nnuclear technologies. Given the work in which we are \r\ncurrently engaged with the IAEA, we look forward to \r\nfurther updates on the proposal to create a one-house \r\napproach to cancer-related issues as part of the ongoing \r\nreview of the Agency’s Programme of Action for \r\nCancer Therapy.\r\nWe are honoured to have received the Deputy \r\nDirector General and Head of the Department of \r\nTechnical Cooperation of the IAEA, Mr. Dazhu \r\nYang, who visited Jamaica last month and signed the \r\nCooperation Programme Framework for the period 2018-\r\n2023. New projects will be funded under the 2020-2021 \r\ncycle to tackle coastal and marine pollution, obesity in \r\nyoung children, and the development and use of nuclear \r\ncardiac imaging in the diagnosis and management of \r\ncardiac patients with non-communicable diseases.\r\nIn addition, Jamaica has hosted a number of \r\nmeetings throughout 2018, including an intermediate \r\ncoordination meeting on developing a capacity-building \r\nprogramme to ensure the sustainable operation of \r\nnuclear research reactors through personnel training, \r\nheld in January, and an IAEA regional training course \r\non safeguards implementation in States with small \r\nquantities protocols in May. An IAEA national training \r\ncourse on orphan source search is scheduled to be held \r\nin Kingston from 3 to 6 December.\r\nFourthly, our engagement with the Agency also \r\nextends to the regional level, as we currently participate \r\nin several regional and interregional projects. Therefore, \r\nthe role of the Regional Cooperation Agreement for the \r\nPromotion of Nuclear Science and Technology in Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean remains critical.\r\nJamaica remains fully committed to the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. As \r\nwe look to the third Preparatory Committee for the \r\n2020 Review Conference, we hope that we as an \r\ninternational community will be able to fully commit \r\nto the obligations that have guided us for the past 48 \r\nyears of the Treaty’s existence. We are pleased to note \r\nthat the non-proliferation regime was also bolstered by \r\nthe adoption last year of the Treaty on the Prohibition \r\nof Nuclear Weapons. We are happy to have signed the \r\nTreaty in December and look forward to working with \r\nothers to advance its objectives.\r\nIn closing, Jamaica reiterates its full support to the \r\nDirector General and his team, and assures them of our \r\nunswerving commitment to helping the Agency fulfil \r\nits mandate.\r\nMr. Bayyapu (India): We thank Director General \r\nYukiya Amano for the 2017 report (see A/73/315) of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and \r\nfor his comprehensive statement (see A/73/315/Add.1), \r\nwhich has been circulated. The Agency’s report is \r\nan important publication for gaining an appreciation \r\nof the essential tasks being performed by the IAEA \r\nboth in promoting and in ensuring the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear energy.\r\n09/11/2018 A/73/PV.34\r\n18-36857 15/26\r\nIndia has co-sponsored draft resolution A/73/L.19, \r\non the activities of the IAEA. Today’s debate is an \r\nimportant occasion to reflect upon the critical role \r\nthat the IAEA has played in supporting countries in \r\npursuit of nuclear power in a safe and secure way and \r\nin conducting technical cooperation activities to bring \r\nnuclear applications to its member States.\r\nNuclear power remains an important option for \r\nmeeting the challenges of increased energy demands, \r\naddressing concerns about climate change, lowering \r\nvolatile fossil-fuel prices and ensuring the security of the \r\nenergy supply. In that context, the IAEA International \r\nMinisterial Conference on Nuclear Power in the Twenty-\r\nFirst Century, in Abu Dhabi, played a significant role \r\nin bringing policy-makers, scientists, technologists and \r\nenvironmentalists together to examine the prospects \r\nof nuclear power. The Agency needs to continue its \r\nprogrammes of support for member States embarking \r\non or expanding their nuclear-energy programmes \r\nand, most importantly, to support member States in \r\nenhancing their capacity to build public acceptance of \r\nnuclear energy.\r\nIndia attaches importance to the Agency’s work in \r\nthe different fields of nuclear science. We contribute \r\nto those activities by participating in the technical \r\nmeetings and coordinated research projects. The \r\nAgency’s programmes and achievements related to \r\nnuclear applications in food and agriculture, health \r\nand nutrition, water resources management, protection \r\nof the environment and others are helpful in meeting \r\nthe needs of developing countries. India will continue \r\nto provide its support to those Agency programmes \r\nthrough the service of experts and offer training \r\nslots in reputed institutions in India for experts from \r\nMember States.\r\nAdvanced fission reactors, including fast reactors, \r\ncontribute to a more efficient use of nuclear fuel and \r\nto reducing the volume of radioactive waste. India \r\nparticipated actively and exchanged information on new \r\ndevelopments and experience in the field of fast reactors \r\nand related technologies during the International \r\nConference on Fast Reactors and Related Fuel Cycles, \r\nheld in the Russian Federation in June 2017.\r\nThorium-based fuel cycles and technologies present \r\nopportunities for enhanced passive safety features and \r\nthe utilization of the larger source of natural resources \r\nprovided by thorium and its inherent proliferation \r\nresistance. International collaboration under the IAEA \r\nwould help provide a much wider resource base for \r\nfuture nuclear technology development in that direction.\r\nWe support the Agency’s nuclear fusion programme. \r\nWe are pleased to inform the Assembly that India hosted \r\nthe twenty-seventh IAEA Fusion Energy Conference \r\nlast month in the city of Ahmedabad. The Conference \r\nprovided a forum for the discussion of key physics and \r\ntechnology issues, as well as innovative concepts of \r\ndirect relevance to the use of nuclear fusion as a source \r\nof energy. With the participation of several international \r\norganizations, as well as the collaboration of more \r\nthan 40 countries and several research institutes, \r\nincluding those working on smaller plasma devices, the \r\nConference helped to identify possibilities and means \r\nfor continuous and effective international collaboration \r\nin that area.\r\nWe also take note of the Agency’s work in improving \r\nglobal safety and security. In that regard, we appreciate \r\nthe review and publication of safety standards and \r\nsecurity guidance that serve as an international \r\nreference for nuclear safety and security. India remains \r\ncommitted to supporting the work of the IAEA.\r\nMr. Kim Song (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is taking the f loor to clarify its \r\nposition with regard to the nuclear tests described \r\nunfairly in the report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (see A/73/315).\r\nBased on our willingness to end this history of \r\nconfrontation and achieve lasting peace on the Korean \r\npeninsula, we proactively proposed the establishment \r\nof a peace region and the denuclearization of the \r\npeninsula, and made sincere efforts to that end. Thanks \r\nto the initiative and efforts of the Government of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, an atmosphere \r\nof dialogue and cooperation, détente and peace has \r\nbeen created on the Korean peninsula, which has had \r\na positive influence on progress towards stability in \r\nNorth-East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region as a whole.\r\nSignificant events such as the historic inter-Korean \r\nsummit meetings and the first-ever Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea-United States summit \r\ntalks have taken place and were welcomed with the \r\nenthusiastic support of the entire world. In April, \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea took the \r\ninitiative to discontinue nuclear and intercontinental \r\nballistic-rocket testing and irreversibly dismantle the \r\nnuclear test site. Most recently, under the observation \r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n16/26 18-36857\r\nof experts from interested countries, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea began to permanently shut \r\ndown the Tongchang-ri missile-engine testing and \r\nrocket-launch facility. We also expressed our intention \r\nto take additional measures, such as the permanent \r\ndismantling of the nuclear facilities at Nyŏngbyŏn, if \r\nthe United States takes corresponding actions in line \r\nwith the spirit of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea-United States joint statement of 12 June.\r\nThe discontinuation of nuclear tests is an \r\nimportant process for global nuclear disarmament, \r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s \r\nproactive measures are a significant contribution to \r\ninternational efforts towards nuclear disarmament. The \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea maintains its \r\nconsistent position that it will faithfully implement the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea-United States \r\njoint statement.\r\nPeace and stability on the Korean peninsula will \r\nbe guaranteed if the hostile relations that have lasted \r\nfor more than half a century are brought  to an end \r\nand if new relations between the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States are established \r\non the basis of mutual trust and peaceful coexistence. \r\nConfidence-building, with the aim of removing deep-\r\nrooted distrust between the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States, should be \r\na top priority in our efforts to achieve the complete \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\r\nThe report of the IAEA, which fails to mention \r\nthe positive developments that have taken place on the \r\nKorean peninsula this year, is fraught with prejudices \r\nand distortions, which shows that the IAEA has lost \r\nits impartiality as an international organization and \r\nis being manipulated for impure political purposes. \r\nAccordingly, the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea delegation categorically rejects the report of \r\nthe IAEA.\r\nThe IAEA should take a fair and impartial stance \r\nand call upon the international community to respond \r\nto the goodwill measures taken by the Government of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Abbani (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the President for the \r\nexcellent way in which she is guiding our work.\r\nMy country has taken note of the annual report (see \r\nA/73/315) of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), which provides an overview of the activities \r\nand achievements of the Agency in 2017 in the main \r\nareas of technological cooperation, nuclear technology, \r\nnuclear safety and security, as well as the safeguards \r\nagreements. Given the importance of the issues \r\naddressed by the report, I would like to touch upon the \r\nfollowing elements.\r\nFirst, Algeria welcomes the first international \r\nconference on the IAEA Technical Cooperation \r\nProgramme, held in Vienna at the end of May 2017, \r\nwhich was an important opportunity to address the \r\ntechnological contributions and uses of atomic energy \r\nto achieve and implement the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, as well as exchange experiences in that regard. We \r\nvalue the level of participation in the conference, which \r\nproves the engagement and interest of Member States \r\nin promoting and bolstering technological cooperation.\r\nSecondly, in the light of the future expansion of the \r\nIAEA Technical Cooperation Programme, my country, \r\nwhich regularly makes financial contributions to the \r\nregular budget of the IAEA and the Technological \r\nCooperation Fund, calls for the allocation of secured, \r\nadequate and predictable financial resources to allow the \r\nAgency to fulfil its future commitments, including the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThirdly, within the framework of our national \r\nprogramme to combat cancer, my country increased its \r\nactivities related to the training of medical physicists \r\nand qualified staff in protection from radioactivity. \r\nThis falls under the implementation of the action \r\nplan adopted by Algeria in accordance with the \r\nrecommendations of the IAEA.\r\nFourthly, Algeria has developed facilities to train \r\npersonnel and maintain nuclear equipment with the \r\nassistance of the Agency. Those facilities carry out \r\nperiodic training programmes, including programmes \r\ntargeting African States.\r\nFifthly, my country continues to make considerable \r\nefforts to promote technical cooperation among African \r\nStates within the framework of the African Regional \r\nCooperative Agreement for Research, Development and \r\nTraining related to Nuclear Science and Technology. In \r\nthis regard, the four regional centres in Algeria affiliated \r\nwith that Agreement are working to promote protection \r\nagainst nuclear radiation and improve nuclear medicine \r\nand food safety.\r\n09/11/2018 A/73/PV.34\r\n18-36857 17/26\r\nAlgeria attaches paramount importance to nuclear \r\nsafety and security. We therefore value the efforts \r\nof the IAEA to this end, given the Agency’s broad \r\nexpertise in developing the international nuclear \r\nsafety and security framework. Algeria reaffirms its \r\nprincipled position that the primary responsibility for \r\nnuclear safety and security in a given State lies with \r\nthat State. My delegation also stresses that measures for \r\npromoting nuclear safety and security must not hinder \r\ninternational cooperation in this area nor restrict the \r\npriorities of the Technical Cooperation Programme, as \r\ndefined by the Agency.\r\nAt the national level, Algeria is working tirelessly \r\nto promote the national infrastructure for protection \r\nagainst radioactivity by developing a strict control \r\nsystem in the use of atomic radioactive devices, as well \r\nas establishing laws and regulations that ensure and \r\nenhance protection from nuclear and radioactive risks.\r\nAlgeria considers the IAEA verification \r\nsystem to be an essential element in the multilateral \r\ndenuclearization and non-proliferation regime, \r\nand stresses the universalization of the system. \r\nAccordingly, the IAEA provides the best legal \r\nframework for assuring non-nuclear States that nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation commitments will be kept in line with \r\nthe comprehensive safeguard agreements.\r\nThe provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons guarantee States parties the right \r\nto develop and produce nuclear energy for peaceful \r\nuses. This inherent right must not be prejudiced for \r\nany reason, especially with respect to nuclear safety \r\nand security.\r\nAs a State party to the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free \r\nZone Treaty — also known as the Pelindaba \r\nTreaty — Algeria reiterates its firm commitment to the \r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones all over \r\nthe world, given their importance to strengthening \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, Algeria reiterates its concern about \r\nobstacles to the establishment of a Middle East zone free \r\nof nuclear weapons. In this regard, we call on all States \r\nto support the negotiating conference to be held in 2019 \r\nfor the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons \r\nand weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. \r\nSuch a conference would be an extremely practical and \r\nimportant step towards achieving security, stability and \r\npeace in the region and throughout the world.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like to begin by thanking Director \r\nGeneral Yukiya Amano for the comprehensive 2017 \r\nreport (see A/73/315) submitted by the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\r\nThe Argentine Republic has been committed to the \r\nwork of the IAEA since its inception, and it is in this \r\nspirit that we have co-sponsored the draft resolution \r\non the report (A/73/L.19). The Argentine Republic \r\nunderstands that the IAEA plays a critical role in \r\npromoting the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, a \r\nrole that should continue to be strengthened.\r\nIt is impossible for us to think of a future of \r\nsubstantive sustainability and energy sustainability \r\nwithout a nuclear component as part of the global energy \r\nmix. Argentina hopes to play a pivotal role in this \r\nprocess by investing in technology for nucleo-electric \r\npower generation. Argentina’s nuclear sector enjoys \r\na prominent international profile with an extensive \r\ndevelopment of nuclear applications for peaceful and \r\ncivil use, which is of vital importance for the application \r\nof the international safeguards system. For this reason, \r\nwe reiterate the importance of ensuring that activities \r\nfor the implementation of safeguards are efficient, \r\neffective and based on a solid technical foundation \r\nand guarantee their non-discriminatory nature. The \r\neffectiveness of the verification system implemented \r\nby the IAEA for nuclear activities is essential for \r\npreventing nuclear proliferation and is undoubtedly the \r\ncentral pillar on which the international community \r\nhas worked for decades to prevent the misuse of nuclear \r\nmaterials and technologies.\r\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Argentina considers \r\nit vital that such verification measures not affect the \r\ninalienable right of States to the development of nuclear \r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes, as established in \r\narticle IV of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons. Argentina wishes to reiterate the \r\nneed for the safeguards regime and its guarantees to \r\nbe implemented in an atmosphere of cooperation and \r\ndialogue. In this regard, we wish to highlight once again \r\nthe quadripartite agreement that Argentina has with \r\nits sister country, the Federative Republic of Brazil, \r\nthe Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and \r\nControl of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) and the IAEA, \r\nwhich, since 1991 has been defining and regulating \r\ncooperation activities for the application of nuclear \r\nsafeguards. The establishment of the ABACC was a \r\nmilestone, not only in terms of our relationship with \r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n18/26 18-36857\r\nBrazil, but also in confidence-building and providing \r\ncredible guarantees for the exclusively peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear development in both countries. It also served as \r\na significant regional contribution because it enabled \r\nus to consolidate the idea of a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nLatin America.\r\nArgentina’s commitment to the highest standards \r\nof nuclear safety continues to be one of the pillars \r\nof our policy in this area. Our Nuclear Regulatory \r\nAuthority is the independent technical and regulatory \r\nbody designated by law to monitor all such activities, \r\nincluding the proper inspection of the construction \r\nof reactors. We also had the honour to showcase our \r\ncommitment in this regard by presiding over the \r\ndiplomatic conference held in 2015 to examine the \r\nproposal to amend article 18 of the Convention on \r\nNuclear Safety, at which the Vienna Declaration on \r\nNuclear Safety, which reflected the interest of many \r\nStates parties in continuing to strengthen technological \r\nsecurity, was adopted.\r\nArgentina wishes to highlight the achievements of \r\nthe seventh review meeting of the contracting parties \r\nto the Convention on Nuclear Safety in 2017 and is \r\ncommitted to continuing to work on the preparatory \r\naspects of the eighth meeting, which will take place \r\nin 2020. The 2017 Convention was the first time a \r\npeer review was carried out on the implementation of \r\nthe principles of the Vienna Declaration on Nuclear \r\nSafety. I would also like to highlight the importance \r\nof the sixth review meeting of the Joint Convention \r\non the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the \r\nSafety of Radioactive Waste Management, in May and \r\nJune, which enjoyed the participation of nearly 1,000 \r\nrepresentatives and 78 contracting parties.\r\nArgentina wishes to express its recognition \r\nand support for the work of the IAEA which respect \r\nto physical nuclear security. In this regard, our \r\ncountry has repeatedly underscored the central role \r\nof the Agency in articulating and strengthening the \r\narchitecture for physical nuclear security, while calling \r\nfor it to exercise a more active role in this field. Our \r\ncountry is involved in the preparatory work that will \r\nlead to the IAEA International Conference on Nuclear \r\nSecurity, in February 2020, and in reviewing the \r\nimplementation of the amendment to the International \r\nConference on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material \r\nand Nuclear Facilities, in 2021. We believe that these \r\ninitiatives reaffirm the essential responsibility and core \r\nrole of the IAEA in strengthening and coordinating the \r\ninternational architecture for physical nuclear security.\r\nIt is our desire that the IAEA should continue to \r\nexercise its role as the main coordinator around other \r\ninternational organizations and initiatives in this area \r\nso that efforts on physical nuclear security and in the \r\nfight against nuclear terrorism can converge in an \r\norderly and sustained manner. I would also like to \r\nhighlight the importance of supporting the work of the \r\nIAEA, not only from a political perspective, but also \r\nfinancially, given that nuclear security is clearly an \r\narea where countries must make their actions match \r\ntheir words.\r\nWe would also like to recall that aspects related \r\nto physical nuclear security are the sovereign faculty \r\nof each State, and that advances and improvements to \r\ncounteract terrorist threats must correspond to the real \r\nrisk that each country faces. On this basis, we reaffirm \r\nthe need to harmonize both binding and non-binding \r\nmeasures in order to progress gradually, sustainably \r\nand cooperatively.\r\nArgentina has been an active participant in and \r\naspires to become a focal point for conducting training \r\nactivities in the region. In this regard, our country has \r\noffered to host several activities related to education, \r\ntraining and human resources in the field of peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy, under the auspices of the IAEA. \r\nArgentina will continue to work with the Agency’s \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme, where we offer our \r\nexperience in and facilities for training and capacity-\r\nbuilding, which have already benefited technical \r\npersonnel and professionals both from our region and \r\naround the world.\r\nMr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): I thank \r\nthe distinguished Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for his report (see \r\nA/73/315).\r\nToday, nuclear energy is part and parcel of \r\nthe socioeconomic development of our societies. \r\nAccordingly, all States, in particular developing \r\ncountries, must have free and indiscriminate access to \r\nall benefits of nuclear energy. From this perspective, \r\nIran stresses the great importance of the full realization \r\nof the inalienable right of any State to develop research, \r\nproduction and uses of nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes, which includes the inherent right of each State \r\nto develop a full national nuclear-fuel cycle for peaceful \r\npurposes. Likewise, they have the right to participate in \r\n09/11/2018 A/73/PV.34\r\n18-36857 19/26\r\nthe fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials \r\nand scientific and technological information for the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nThese inherent rights have also been reaffirmed \r\nin the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons. Accordingly, developed States parties are \r\nobliged to cooperate in the further development of \r\napplications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, \r\nespecially in developing countries. In this context, \r\narticle II of the IAEA Statute mandates the Agency to \r\nseek to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic \r\nenergy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the \r\nworld. For this reason, Iran emphasizes the importance \r\nof the Agency’s statutory functions and primary \r\nresponsibility in assisting Member States in research \r\non, and the practical application of, nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes. Appreciating the related activities \r\nof the Agency, Iran stresses the need for their further \r\nenhancement, particularly to meet the expectations \r\nof developing countries. It should be ensured that the \r\nAgency’s Technical Cooperation Programme remains \r\nfirm and sustainable through sufficient, assured and \r\npredictable financial and human resources.\r\nIran underlines that the IAEA is the sole competent \r\nauthority responsible for the verification of the \r\nfulfilment of safeguards obligations. Related functions \r\nof the Agency should be carried out in full conformity \r\nwith the relevant legally binding instruments and take \r\ninto account the concerns and interests of Member \r\nStates, particularly in strict observance of the principle \r\nof confidentiality.\r\nIran is determined to vigorously continue \r\nexercising its inalienable right to nuclear energy, \r\nincluding the development of a full national nuclear-\r\nfuel cycle for peaceful purposes, which is essential \r\nfor its socioeconomic development. All accusations \r\nagainst Iran’s nuclear programme were baseless from \r\nthe beginning; the crisis was manufactured to sustain \r\npressure on Iran. However, the crisis came to an end \r\nwith the conclusion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \r\nAction (JCPOA), which was the outcome of lengthy and \r\nintensive multilateral diplomatic efforts undertaken to \r\nresolve an artificial crisis and build trust.\r\nNow, according to the IAEA, Iran is subject to the \r\nmost robust nuclear verification regime. Likewise, in \r\nits 12 consecutive reports, the IAEA has confirmed \r\nIran’s full compliance with its commitments under \r\nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan. However, in violation \r\nof its international commitments, the current United \r\nStates Administration withdrew from the JCPOA \r\nand reimposed its illegal sanctions against Iran. The \r\nUnited States continues to systematically violate \r\nits commitments under the JCPOA and Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2231 (2015). It is now brazenly \r\nforcing others to either violate resolution 2231 (2015) \r\nor face punishment. All such illegal measures of the \r\nUnited States have been rejected by the international \r\ncommunity, including by almost all its friends and \r\nallies. The United States policy towards the JCPOA and \r\nresolution 2231 (2015) clearly indicates that, even in the \r\npast, they did not have any genuine concern about Iran’s \r\nnuclear programme. They openly lied in expressing \r\nconcern over this programme only to continue their \r\nanimosity towards Iran.\r\nIn a statement made on 2 November, the European \r\nUnion High Representative, Federica Mogherini, and \r\nthe Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance of France, \r\nGermany and the United Kingdom called the JCPOA \r\na key element of the global nuclear non-proliferation \r\narchitecture and of multilateral diplomacy — and \r\ncrucial for the security of Europe, the region and the \r\nentire world. Therefore, to ensure the continuity of a \r\ndocument as important as the JCPOA, the international \r\ncommunity must remain vigilant and not allow itself \r\nto be deceived once again by the fabrications of the \r\nUnited States, which are rooted solely in its hostility \r\ntowards Iran.\r\nIran has been and will remain fully committed to \r\nthe JCPOA, inasmuch as all other JCPOA participants \r\nalso fulfil their related commitments in a complete \r\nand timely manner. The JCPOA acknowledges \r\nIran’s discretionary right to cease performance of its \r\ncommitments under the agreement in whole or in part \r\nif the lifted sanctions under the deal are reintroduced or \r\nreimposed. Paragraphs 26 and 36 reflect the common \r\nunderstanding at the time of negotiations that any \r\nreimposition of sanctions gives Iran the right to respond \r\nby wholly or partially ceasing to perform its reciprocal \r\nmeasures under the agreement.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has made it very clear \r\non various occasions that the reimposition of sanctions \r\nwas a grave material breach of the JCPOA. Iran has \r\ncalled upon the remaining participants of the JCPOA to \r\nhold the United States accountable for the consequences \r\nof its reckless, wrongful act, and stated that, in order to \r\nmaintain implementation of the JCPOA in its totality, \r\nthe remaining JCPOA participants needed to provide \r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n20/26 18-36857\r\nobjective guarantees that Iran would be compensated \r\nunconditionally through the appropriate national, \r\nregional and global measures.\r\nThe JCPOA participants are therefore urged to \r\nfulfil all their commitments in a genuine spirit. This \r\nis indeed in the interest of the JCPOA participants \r\nand the international community of States as a whole. \r\nTherefore, current support for the full implementation \r\nof the JCPOA by all its participants needs to be \r\nmaintained. Likewise, in line with the principles \r\nembodied in the Charter of the United Nations and in \r\nsupport of multilateralism, the international community \r\nhas a responsibility to preserve the JCPOA by rejecting \r\nthe illegal unilateral measures of the United States.\r\nMr. Trejo Blanco (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of \r\nthe Republic of El Salvador.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to express my appreciation \r\nto Director General Yukiya Amano for presenting \r\nthe report (see A/73/315) of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) on the Agency’s activities \r\nduring 2017.\r\nThe draft resolution on the report of the IAEA that \r\nis approved by the General Assembly each year is based \r\non the agreement between the United Nations and the \r\nAgency signed in 1957. The draft resolution reaffirms \r\nthe indispensable role of the Agency in aiding the \r\ndevelopment and use of nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes, the transfer of technologies to developing \r\ncountries and in maintaining a nuclear security and \r\nverification regime.\r\nMy delegation believes that this is a unique \r\nopportunity to keep abreast of the activities that the \r\nAgency has undertaken during the reporting period, as \r\nwell as to provide Member States with the opportunity \r\nto engage in and support the Agency’s ongoing work. \r\nWe welcome the decisions adopted by the General \r\nConference of the IAEA at its sixty-second session, \r\nheld from 17 to 21 September.\r\nIn this context, my country recognizes the sovereign \r\nright to exploit and make use of nuclear technologies \r\nexclusively for peaceful purposes, as established in \r\narticle IV of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons. At the same time, we reaffirm \r\nour obligation to work towards general and complete \r\ndisarmament as the only means of guaranteeing \r\ninternational peace and stability.\r\nAt the global level, our countries must continue \r\nto promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, science \r\nand technology for exclusively peaceful purposes and \r\nprevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which \r\nwill enable us to continue contributing to sustainable \r\ndevelopment and world peace. My country is aware of \r\nthe benefits of nuclear technology for the peoples of \r\nthe world, not only in generating nuclear power, but \r\nalso in various areas such as health, agriculture, food \r\nsecurity, the environment and research, inter alia. For \r\nthis reason, El Salvador is convinced that, through joint \r\nwork, cooperation and the establishment of synergies \r\nbetween countries for the proper and peaceful use of \r\nnuclear technology, it is possible to achieve excellent \r\nresults that foster scientific development for the benefit \r\nof our populations.\r\nIn particular, El Salvador wishes to highlight the \r\nimportant role of the Programme of Action for Cancer \r\nTherapy in examining and strengthening its national \r\ncapacities for cancer control. We hope to be able to \r\nwork more closely in future with a view to improving \r\nthe efficiency of radiological medicine services as part \r\nof an comprehensive framework for cancer control, and \r\nin supporting the training of health professionals.\r\nWe would therefore like to reiterate that it is \r\nindispensable for countries to join with the IAEA in \r\nworking to ensure that the use of nuclear energy is \r\nused to increase health coverage and quality and food \r\nproduction and supply, as well as promote the more \r\neffective prevention and reduction of the negative \r\nimpacts of climate change and greater attention to \r\nnatural disasters, among other aspects of high priority \r\nfor my country that contribute to achieving true \r\nhuman development.\r\nEl Salvador appreciates the constant and invaluable \r\nsupport of the IAEA for the implementation and \r\nstrengthening of the uses of atomic energy in technology \r\nand science, which has enabled my country to make \r\nimportant strides in terms of its uses. It therefore hopes \r\nto continue to deepen its bilateral cooperation relations \r\nwith the IAEA, in recognition of its important value \r\nadded as an agency.\r\nWe are currently preparing our national \r\nprogramme framework for the period 2018-2023, in \r\norder to continue strengthening cooperation between \r\nEl Salvador and the IAEA, a mechanism that facilitates \r\nthe alignment of the Agency’s work with the priorities \r\nof the Government of El Salvador. Moreover, in order \r\n09/11/2018 A/73/PV.34\r\n18-36857 21/26\r\nto contribute to global efforts aimed at achieving \r\neffective nuclear physical security and ensuring the \r\nefficient implementation of international instruments, \r\nmy country is pleased to announce that it has joined the \r\nIncident and Trafficking Database programme, which \r\nis a system that has confirmed its relevance in detecting \r\nincidents and preventing them when they are related \r\nto illicit trafficking or the malicious use of nuclear \r\nenergy, in support of and ensuring the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear energy.\r\nFinally, we would like to reiterate our firm \r\ncommitment to continuing working hand in hand with \r\nthe Agency, and we urge Member States to continue to \r\nsupport the activities of the IAEA.\r\nMr. Hassan (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Egypt \r\nwelcomes the General Assembly’s imminent adoption \r\nby consensus of draft resolution A/73/L.19, of which \r\nit is a co-sponsor, on the annual report (see A/73/315) \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \r\nWe commend the efforts of the Director General of \r\nthe Agency and the Jordanian delegation in drafting \r\nthe report and in preparing and submitting the draft \r\nresolution, respectively.\r\nAs one of the founding States of the IAEA, Egypt \r\nwas one of the very first countries to use atomic energy \r\nfor peaceful purposes and is now building a nuclear \r\nreactor. Accordingly, we attach great importance to \r\nthe Agency’s activities in the areas of the peaceful uses \r\nof nuclear energy and the promotion of international \r\ncooperation and technical support, as well as nuclear \r\nsafeguards, verification, safety and security. We \r\nsupport the efforts of the Agency and the activities of \r\nits Secretariat in all of these areas, under the leadership \r\nof the Director General, particularly at a time when \r\nwe are preparing to launch our first national plant to \r\ngenerate electricity using nuclear energy.\r\nEgypt calls once again for efforts to be stepped up \r\nto provide the Agency with the financing and human \r\nresources it needs to complete its tasks in terms of \r\ntechnical cooperation and in striking a balance among \r\nits three pillars, in line with its Statute and fulfilling \r\nits raison d’être. Proper support for the Agency would \r\nalso ensure the continuity and stability of the Agency’s \r\nactivities in promoting all forms of peaceful use of \r\natomic energy, especially in developing countries, \r\nwhile taking into account the fact that the peaceful use \r\nof atomic energy in all its forms and manifestations is \r\nan inalienable right.\r\nIn the same vein, Egypt is striving to ensure the \r\nsuccess of the ministerial meeting on nuclear science \r\nand technology to be held in Vienna in November. As \r\na member of the IAEA Board of Governors, Egypt is \r\nalso working to support the Agency’s activities in the \r\nareas of technical cooperation and nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity, while devoting the  necessary attention to the \r\nAgency’s development role and the interests of African \r\nStates and the Group of 77 and China.\r\nEgypt reaffirms that the IAEA is the sole entity \r\ninternationally mandated to issue verification \r\nreports on States’ compliance with the obligations \r\nof the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons regime. \r\nIn addition, in accordance with the IAEA Statute, \r\nthe Agency also plays a vital role in galvanizing \r\ndenuclearization efforts; in verifying the dismantling \r\nof nuclear weapons, thereby assuming an important role \r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security; \r\nand in implementing all obligations set forth in the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT), particularly article VI.\r\nEgypt attaches great importance to the Agency’s \r\nactivities in implementing safeguards and in impartially \r\nand independently verifying the non-diversion of \r\nnuclear materials from exclusively peaceful uses, \r\npursuant to the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, \r\nwhich is the legal basis for this aspect of the work of \r\nthe Agency, under the NPT. To fully achieve these \r\nends, the Agreement must be universally adopted. We \r\nalso stress that strengthening the Agency’s safeguards \r\nsystem should not entail any commitment beyond the \r\ncontractual obligations provided for in the NPT. Indeed, \r\napplying safeguards at the State level requires the \r\nconsent of the country concerned, not just consultations \r\nwith it.\r\nIn conclusion, Egypt looks forward to the Agency’s \r\nimplementation of the mandate provided for in the \r\nrecently adopted General Conference resolution on \r\napplying the IAEA safeguards in the Middle East, \r\nwhich would establish a Middle East zone free of \r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction \r\n(GC(62)/RES/12). We also look forward to the taking \r\nof the steps necessary to implement the resolution, \r\ngiven the important developments that took place in \r\nthe First Committee at its current session, namely, the \r\nadoption of a draft decision calling on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to convene a conference on this topic in 2019 \r\n(A/C.1/73/L.22/Rev.1).\r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n22/26 18-36857\r\nMs. Rodríguez Abascal (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba recognizes and supports the important work of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in \r\npursuit of sustainable peace and development, as well \r\nas the advances made during the recent period. The \r\nachievement of the objective of nuclear disarmament \r\nhas been and will continue to be the highest priority in \r\nthe field of disarmament.\r\nWe recognize the contribution of the \r\nimplementation of the IAEA safeguards verification \r\nsystem, which is essential to certify the peaceful nature \r\nof nuclear-energy programmes. We also appreciate the \r\nindispensable and significant contribution of the IAEA \r\nin the promotion and development of the application of \r\nnuclear technologies in such key areas for the economy \r\nand society as human health, with special attention \r\nto the cancer-control programme, food security, \r\nagriculture and environmental protection.\r\nIn 2017, in the area of technical cooperation, our \r\ncountry achieved an implementation rate of 96.5 per \r\ncent in projects with the Agency and took part in 50 \r\nregional projects. We carried out 19 training courses \r\nin the form of scholarships and scientific visits, and \r\nparticipated in 55 courses and 49 technical meetings. \r\nDuring the period, 90 expert missions were carried out \r\nin different countries. Our country hosted scholarship \r\nholders and scientific visitors from abroad, as well as \r\nsix regional events.\r\nWe will continue cooperating with developing \r\ncountries and sharing the results and experiences of our \r\nyears of technical cooperation with the IAEA. Given the \r\nimportance of continuing to support the development \r\nand promotion of nuclear applications and technical \r\ncooperation in developing countries and to assist in the \r\ntransfer of technology to those countries, the Agency \r\nmust redouble its efforts to increase the resources of \r\nthe Technical Cooperation Programme, with the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development as its main focus.\r\nOur country firmly supports the inalienable right \r\nof all States to develop research, production and use \r\nof nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, without \r\nany discrimination or conditions. Cuba reiterates its \r\nrejection of and demands the immediate lifting of \r\nany kind of limitations and restrictions on exports \r\nto developing countries of materials, equipment and \r\ntechnologies for peaceful nuclear activities.\r\nWe reject the United States Government’s decision \r\nto withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \r\nAction and to reimpose unilateral sanctions against \r\nIran. It is unjustified, contrary to international law, and \r\ncontravenes the norms of coexistence among States, \r\nand, as a result, could lead to  serious consequences for \r\nstability and security, thereby distancing us from the \r\nobjective of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in \r\nthe Middle East.\r\nWe reaffirm our support for the establishment of \r\na zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of \r\nmass destruction in the Middle East. In this regard, \r\nwe deeply regret the fact that the conference planned \r\nfor this purpose has not yet been held, and we support \r\nthe initiative of the League of Arab States to hold a \r\nconference no later than June 2019 to commence \r\nnegotiations on a legally binding treaty on the issue.\r\nLast year, the Republic of Cuba deposited with the \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency its instrument of ratification of the Convention \r\non Nuclear Safety and its instrument of accession \r\nto the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel \r\nManagement and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste \r\nManagement. That shows our country’s unquestionable \r\ncommitment to nuclear safety. The effective \r\nmanagement of nuclear physical security does not \r\nadmit exclusions or selectivity. The framework for the \r\nadoption of international standards on physical security \r\nis the IAEA, which must be the result of transparent \r\nand inclusive multilateral negotiations, with the \r\nparticipation of all States.\r\nThe entry into force of the amendment to the \r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \r\nMaterial should provide greater protection for nuclear \r\nfacilities and materials; facilitate cooperation among \r\nStates parties to prevent and combat crimes involving \r\nthe use of radioactive and nuclear materials; and ratify \r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy. The possibility of \r\na terrorist attack using nuclear materials cannot be \r\neliminated through a selective approach that is limited \r\nto horizontal proliferation and that disregards vertical \r\nproliferation and disarmament.\r\nFinally, we congratulate the IAEA on its work and \r\noutstanding contribution to issues of such importance \r\nas climate change, combating desertification and \r\ndrought, food security and the treatment of diseases, \r\nas well as the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change.\r\n09/11/2018 A/73/PV.34\r\n18-36857 23/26\r\nMr. Fadhil (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nmy delegation would like to express its appreciation \r\nto Mr. Amano, Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for presenting the \r\nAgency’s annual report, which outlines the IAEA’s \r\nachievements and activities in 2017 (see A/73/315). We \r\nalso express our sincere thanks to the delegation of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, in its capacity as Chair \r\nof the IAEA Board of Governors, for facilitating the \r\ndraft resolution before us (A/73/L.19).\r\nIraq emphasizes the primacy of the Agency’s \r\nactivities in providing technical cooperation to \r\ndeveloping countries, including my own. When we use \r\nnuclear technology in such areas as health, agriculture, \r\nfood, water resources, radioactive isotopes and radiation \r\ntechnology, we are benefiting from programmes created \r\nby the IAEA.\r\nThe Technical Cooperation Programme is one \r\nof the Agency’s principal means for promoting and \r\ntransferring nuclear technology to achieve sustainable \r\nsocioeconomic progress in developing nations, in \r\naccordance with its Statute. The Programme is a joint \r\nresponsibility of the Agency and its member States, and \r\nit is implemented according to the requirements and \r\nneeds of its members. If the Programme is to succeed, \r\nconcerted efforts are necessary, as is the provision of \r\nsufficient guaranteed resources that are proportional to \r\nthe resources allocated to the Agency’s other activities, \r\npursuant to the Statute.\r\nAt the national level, despite the huge challenges it \r\nfaced, my Government achieved great success when it \r\nliberated some of the hot spots of terrorism, the most \r\nrecent of which was the Nineveh governorate, which \r\nwe rid of Da’esh terrorist gangs. Nevertheless, while \r\nfacing such challenges, Iraq ratified the Convention \r\non the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the \r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts \r\nof Nuclear Terrorism and adopted measures needed \r\nto implement these conventions through specialized \r\ncommittees set up for that purpose.\r\nMy Government is working steadfastly to dispose \r\nof nuclear waste and address other challenges through \r\ndirect coordination with and tailored technical \r\ncooperation from the IAEA. These tasks are being \r\naccomplished entirely upon Iraq’s initiative and on \r\nnational policies adopted by our Government on the \r\nmanagement of radioactive waste arising from the \r\ndismantling of previously destroyed nuclear sites, as \r\nwell as from medical, industrial and oil installations.\r\nWith regard to organizational issues around nuclear \r\nand radioactive activity, my Government has made \r\nimportant strides, including Law No. 43, enacted in \r\n2016, which established an atomic energy commission \r\nin Iraq. We are currently taking the steps necessary for \r\nthis commission to start its operations.\r\nMy Government believes that the establishment of \r\na Middle East free of nuclear weapons and weapons of \r\nmass destruction is one of the fundamental steps that \r\nneed to be taken to ensure the security and stability \r\nof the region. However, the sensitive and dangerous \r\ndevelopments taking place at the international \r\nlevel in general and in the Middle East in particular \r\ncompel the international community to take collective \r\nresponsibility for the situation and require concerted \r\nefforts aimed at the establishment of such a zone.\r\nAccordingly, my delegation once again emphasizes \r\nthe vital role played by the United Nations and the three \r\ndepository States of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in convening a conference \r\nto establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle \r\nEast as soon as possible, in line with the 1995 resolution \r\non the Middle East and the Action Plan set forth in the \r\nFinal Document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. \r\nFurthermore, this year, the First Committee adopted \r\na draft decision (A/C.1/73/L.22/Rev.1), whose text \r\nwas introduced by the League of Arab States, calling \r\non the Secretary-General to extend an invitation to \r\nthe countries of the region, the three sponsors of the \r\n1995 resolution on the Middle East responsible for \r\nits implementation, and other relevant international \r\norganizations, to participate in a conference to negotiate \r\na treaty to establish a zone free of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction and nuclear weapons in 2019.\r\nIraq believes that the Israeli entity must start its \r\ndenuclearization process and accede to the NPT as a \r\nnon-nuclear State. Its nuclear facilities must be subjected \r\nto the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement of the \r\nIAEA, which is an urgent and extremely important step \r\nthat must be taken in order to ensure the successful \r\nestablishment of such a zone.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation emphasizes once \r\nagain that it is the inalienable right of all States, \r\nespecially developing States, to develop peaceful \r\nnuclear programmes. Such programmes can lead to \r\nthose States’ unhindered development, circumvent the \r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n24/26 18-36857\r\nmonopolies of a specific group of States and avoid the \r\nimposition of internationally binding conditions that \r\naffect developing States’ interests.\r\nMr. Syrymbet (Kazakhstan): On behalf of the \r\ndelegation of Kazakhstan, I wish to express our sincere \r\nthanks to Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nfor presenting the sixty-second report of the Agency, \r\nfor the calendar year 2017 (see A/73/315). The report \r\nreflects the Agency’s balanced and effective policy in \r\nits key mandates of nuclear safety and security and the \r\nprevention of the spread of nuclear weapons, as well as \r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nKazakhstan fully supports the Agency’s activities \r\nin promoting the transfer and development of \r\ntechnologies related to peaceful nuclear applications. \r\nOver the past few years, our country has contributed \r\nmore than $1 million to the relevant Agency funds. We \r\nintend to further develop our technical cooperation \r\nwith the IAEA for its ongoing programmes and new \r\nexplorations and innovations.\r\nKazakhstan welcomes the Agency’s activities \r\nrelated to implementing safeguards. We believe that \r\nthe Agency system is the most effective instrument \r\nfor supporting the nuclear non-proliferation regime. \r\nKazakhstan supports the preservation and further \r\nunfailing implementation of the Joint Comprehensive \r\nPlan of Action (JCPOA). We commend the IAEA \r\nfor its continued work on the verification of the \r\nimplementation of the JCPOA.\r\nWe wholeheartedly supported the Agency’s \r\nproposed project to establish the IAEA Low Enriched \r\nUranium (LEU) Bank. We are proud that last year, the \r\nIAEA LEU Bank storage facility was inaugurated in \r\nKazakhstan and believe that it will make a significant \r\ncontribution to the development of peaceful uses \r\nof nuclear energy and thereby strengthen global \r\nnuclear security.\r\nHaving traditionally and annually co-sponsored the \r\ndraft resolution on the report of the IAEA, Kazakhstan \r\nsupports draft resolution A/73/L.19, entitled “Report \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency”. With \r\nour deep conviction and commitment, we are indeed \r\npleased to endorse the Agency’s important role in \r\nfulfilling its mandate to promote the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy and in further advancing the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime.\r\nMr. Bin Momen (Bangladesh): Bangladesh takes \r\nnote of the report (see A/73/315) of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and thanks Mr. Yukiya \r\nAmano, Director General, for his able leadership of \r\nthe Agency.\r\nDuring the reporting period, in our national context, \r\nwe have started construction of the Rooppur Nuclear \r\nPower Plant, the first in Bangladesh, under bilateral \r\ncooperation arrangements with the Russian Federation. \r\nFollowing the delivery of a design and construction \r\nlicence from Bangladesh’s atomic energy regulatory \r\nauthority, the first concrete for Units 1 and 2 of the plant \r\nwas poured on 30 November 2017 and 14 July 2018, \r\nrespectively. Furthermore, following the Agency’s \r\nguidelines, the relevant Bangladeshi authorities are \r\nimplementing the integrated work plan for national \r\ninfrastructure developed with the support of IAEA. \r\nWork has already started for recruiting and training \r\npersonnel for the safe operation and maintenance of the \r\nnuclear-power plant.\r\nBangladesh reposes its full confidence in the \r\nguiding role of the IAEA in coordinating international \r\nefforts to strengthen global nuclear safety, security \r\nand safeguards when it comes to the use of nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes. Bangladesh underscores \r\nthe importance of the Agency’s ongoing efforts aimed \r\nat supporting member States in sharing knowledge, \r\nexpertise, technology and information on all aspects \r\nof nuclear safety. We acknowledge the Agency’s work \r\nin maintaining, improving and promoting nuclear, \r\nradiation, transport and waste safety, as well as \r\nemergency preparedness and response worldwide.\r\nWe attach importance also to the Agency’s ongoing \r\nefforts aimed at assisting member States, upon their \r\nrequest, in building and developing their nuclear-security \r\ncapacity, which includes supporting the establishment \r\nof effective, sustainable and comprehensive national \r\nnuclear-security infrastructure. Bangladesh subscribes \r\nto the view that the responsibility for nuclear security \r\nwithin a State rests entirely with the concerned State. \r\nWe also underline that nuclear-security considerations \r\nshould not hamper the utilization of nuclear technology \r\nfor peaceful purposes, nor should it negatively affect \r\ninternational cooperation in that regard.\r\nThe Agency’s work in nuclear power and nuclear \r\napplications continues to underline the need to increase \r\nthe transfer and sharing of nuclear technology and \r\nknowledge with developing countries. In this context, \r\n09/11/2018 A/73/PV.34\r\n18-36857 25/26\r\nwe recall the signing of the country programme \r\nframework for 2018-2023 with the Agency’s Department \r\nof Technical Cooperation in September. The framework \r\nincludes, inter alia, support for a study to use nuclear \r\ntechniques in addressing riverbank erosion in \r\nBangladesh, which is already being accelerated owing \r\nto climate change. We urge the IAEA to continue \r\nto support our efforts to develop nuclear-science \r\neducation and research capacity; promote medical \r\nresearch on cancer therapy and medical treatment for \r\ncertain diseases; increase food production and ensure \r\nfood safety; ameliorate the environment and develop \r\nirradiated crop varieties.\r\nBangladesh actively participated in the sixty-\r\nsecond session of the IAEA General Conference in \r\nSeptember. We support the continuation of IAEA’s \r\nmandated work on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \r\nAction on the question of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s \r\nnuclear programme. We also support the application \r\nof the Agency’s safeguards in the Middle East, \r\nincluding by pursuing the objective of establishing a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. We take note \r\nof the adoption without a vote of the resolution on the \r\nimplementation of the Agreement between the Agency \r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for the \r\napplication of safeguards in connection with the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nIn conclusion, Bangladesh thanks Jordan for \r\nfacilitating the adoption of the draft resolution on the \r\nreport of the IAEA (A/73/L.19).\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 92.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.19, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”. I now give the \r\nf loor to the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to \r\nannounce that since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution and in addition to those delegations listed \r\nin document A/73/L.19, the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors of the draft resolution: Albania, \r\nAlgeria, Australia, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Chile, Costa Rica, Cyprus, the \r\nCzech Republic, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, \r\nEquatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Lithuania, Malaysia, \r\nMalta, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, the \r\nPhilippines, Romania, the Russian Federation, San \r\nMarino, Serbia, Slovakia, South Africa, the Sudan, \r\nSweden, Tajikistan, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Arab \r\nEmirates, the United States of America and Uzbekistan.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.19?\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.19 was adopted (resolution \r\n73/9).\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those \r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the \r\nright of reply. I would like to remind members that \r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second, and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Hallak (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): The performance of the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union (EU) confirmed once again our doubts \r\nand those felt by many Member States with regard to \r\nresolution 65/276, which was submitted and adopted \r\nseveral years ago to grant observer status to the EU and \r\nto give it the right to speak at the United Nations. It \r\nseems to us that the endorsement by Member States of \r\nthat resolution was a great mistake.\r\nThe States members of the EU are responsible for \r\ntwo world wars that killed nearly 100 million people \r\nand destroyed the world at that time. The EU enjoys \r\nobserver status at the United Nations, and we call on it \r\nnot to compete with the United Nations by allocating \r\nawards and sanctions to Member States. The EU is a \r\nmere observer here, and the representative of the EU \r\nmust learn that lesson and recognize his own limitations.\r\nIt is shameful to the General Assembly that the \r\nrepresentative of the EU criticizes certain States in his \r\nstatement and directs accusations against them. What \r\nhe included in his statement confirms the fact that the \r\nEU is playing the role of devil’s advocate. Its statement \r\ndid not even criticize the Israeli entity, which  represents \r\nthe real and perhaps only danger in our region and the \r\nworld owing to its possession of huge arsenals of nuclear \r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction, as well \r\nas their means of delivery, as they could reach beyond \r\nour local region with no international control. There is \r\na clear reason why the EU has not made accusations \r\nagainst Israel for possessing nuclear weapons. It is \r\nbecause certain States of the EU have provided Israel \r\nwith nuclear reactors, heavy water, nuclear technology \r\nA/73/PV.34 09/11/2018\r\n26/26 18-36857\r\nand submarines capable of launching nuclear weapons \r\nas well as other means of delivery.\r\nThe EU should be the last to raise the issue of \r\nnon-proliferation, especially given that four of its \r\nmember States and one other State which seeks to join the \r\nEU have stationed nuclear weapons on their territories, \r\nin grave violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Many EU countries are in \r\nviolation of their own obligations under the NPT and \r\nother conventions of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency. That is because they cooperate with Israel to \r\nbolster its military capacities, especially the capacities \r\nof the Israeli military nuclear programme, as well as \r\nIsrael’s programmes related to other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. Those countries also provide Israel with \r\nexpertise, material and technology, in addition to \r\nassisting Israel in making, possessing and developing \r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nIf the EU were honest in its statement with regard \r\nto supporting a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle \r\nEast, its member States would have voted in favour of the \r\ndraft decision recently adopted by the First Committee \r\n(A/C.1/73/L.22/Rev.1) that calls for the convening of a \r\nconference in 2019 on the establishment of a Middle \r\nEast zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons \r\nof mass destruction. However, the EU countries did not \r\nsupport the convening of such a conference, which is \r\nproof of the hypocritical character of the EU statement \r\nand its clumsy policies.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 92?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m.\r\n"
