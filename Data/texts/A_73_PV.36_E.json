"United Nations A/73/PV.36\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n36th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 20 November 2018, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 124\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand other matters related to the Security Council\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and other matters \r\nrelated to the Security Council has been addressed \r\nby the General Assembly for more than two decades. \r\nNevertheless, despite our efforts, we have yet to reach \r\nagreement on the reform of that body, which is essential \r\nto the United Nations and the multilateral system. In \r\naccordance with the mandate that I have been given, I \r\nwould like to announce the names of the co-Chairs of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on this topic for this \r\nsession. I have reconfirmed Ambassador Lana Zaki \r\nNusseibeh, Permanent Representative of the United \r\nArab Emirates, who held the post in the previous \r\nsession. I have also appointed Ambassador Christian \r\nBraun, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as a \r\nnew co-Chair. I trust that Member States will provide \r\ntheir full cooperation to assist them in the fulfilment of \r\ntheir functions. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress my gratitude for the work of those who fulfilled \r\nthe roles in the previous session, Ambassador Lana Zaki \r\nNusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates, whom I have \r\nalready mentioned, and Ambassador Kaha Imnadze of \r\nGeorgia. I deeply appreciate their efforts and work.\r\nMember States are convinced of the need to reform \r\nthe Security Council. In fact, during September’s general \r\ndebate, at least 80 world leaders emphasized that point. \r\nIn order to achieve tangible results in that process, \r\npolitical will is undoubtedly required. My position on \r\nthe subject has been very clear: I have reiterated on \r\nseveral occasions that the Security Council must adapt \r\nto the new political realities. The reform of the Council \r\nis important, not only for Member States but also for the \r\nentire United Nations system. A Council with greater \r\nrepresentativeness, efficiency and transparency would \r\nundoubtedly increase the legitimacy of its decisions and \r\nspeed up their implementation. In addition, it would \r\nstrengthen multilateralism and contribute to efforts \r\nto achieve a more democratic and effective system of \r\nglobal governance.\r\nUpon assuming my post as President of the General \r\nAssembly, I committed my full support to the reform \r\nprocess of the Security Council, in tune with the urgency \r\nset by Member States. I would like to stress that that \r\nprocess is in the hands of Member States. Given that \r\nit is a process driven by Member States, I can assure \r\nthe Assembly that my role will be to support them in \r\nthat challenge. Given the complexity of the issue, it is \r\nvital to call for dialogue at all times, in earnest, with \r\nrespect and in a spirit of openness. Dialogue always \r\noffers an opportunity — a gateway to reach agreement. \r\nI encourage Member States to explore more pragmatic \r\napproaches and appropriate working methods to \r\nadvance the reform of the Council, particularly in those \r\nareas in which there are still major differences.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

It is perhaps one of the issues \r\nthat requires our best diplomatic skills. The calls for \r\ngreater transparency, accountability and efficiency in \r\nthe actions of the Security Council are a reality. I am \r\nconfident that Member States will continue to devote \r\ntheir best efforts to finding appropriate responses \r\nto those challenges. I reiterate my commitment to \r\nsupporting them in that quest in an impartial, objective \r\nand open manner, and thereby to advance our shared \r\naspirations to reform and optimize the quality and \r\nefficiency of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I have \r\nthe honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\nGroup of Arab States on agenda item 124 concerning \r\nthe question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\nmatters related to the Security Council.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to assure you, Madam \r\nPresident, of the support of the Arab Group for your \r\nefforts in managing the work of the General Assembly \r\nduring the current session, particularly with regard to \r\nthe item under discussion today, which is of special \r\nimportance for all Member States, particularly the \r\nArab Group. I would also like to thank the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Arab Emirates, \r\nAmbassador Lana Nusseibeh, and the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Georgia, Ambassador Kaha \r\nImnadze, for their appreciated efforts as co-Chairs of \r\nthe negotiations during the previous session.\r\nAt a time when the United Nations is undergoing \r\nnumerous reform processes that are intended to \r\nstrengthen its role and enable it to address the growing \r\nchallenges faced by the international community today, \r\nthe reform of the Security Council and its equitable \r\nrepresentation constitute one of the fundamental pillars \r\nfor the overall reform of the United Nations. That is \r\nwhy we are more determined to step up efforts towards \r\nthe genuine and comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil — the body responsible for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, as enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations — in order for \r\nit to be more capable and effective in dealing with \r\nand overcoming those complex challenges in a more \r\ntransparent, neutral and credible way.\r\nAfter two decades of negotiations aimed at \r\nexpanding the membership of the Security Council \r\nand improving its working methods, during which \r\nthere have been several initiatives and stances taken \r\nby numerous States and groups of States, including the \r\nArab Group, it is now important that we move forward \r\nwith the process of Security Council reform. That can \r\nbe achieved through consensus-based solutions that are \r\nsupported with broad acceptance by Member States. \r\nHowever, we do not necessarily have to act hastily \r\nin setting a time frame for the process, as that would \r\nundermine a comprehensive, genuine and real reform.\r\nIn that regard, the Arab Group reiterates that the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations within the framework \r\nof the General Assembly represent the only way to \r\nreach an agreement on the expansion and reform of \r\nthe Security Council, in line with General Assembly \r\ndecision 62/557, which was adopted by consensus and \r\nestablished the practical basis for the negotiations. The \r\nArab Group also underscores that all the five main \r\ntopics of the reform negotiations are interconnected \r\nand share common elements, meaning that they should \r\nbe dealt with in a way that upholds that interconnection \r\nin order to achieve the comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe Arab Group reaffirms its stance on maintaining \r\nthe coherence of the general membership without \r\nundermining the credibility of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, which could result from efforts to impose \r\nsteps that do not enjoy the unanimous support of \r\nMember States. We face several challenges with regard \r\nto Security Council reform, particularly the veto \r\npower and the arbitrary use of that power by certain \r\npermanent members of the Security Council. In many \r\ncases, that arbitrary use has harmed the credibility of \r\nthe decision-making process within the Council, and \r\nhas sometimes made the Council unable to shoulder \r\nits responsibility to take the necessary measures to \r\nmaintain international peace and security. The veto \r\npower of the permanent members of the Council has \r\nbeen used in recent years to protect their national \r\ninterests or those of their allies. In that regard, I \r\nregret to note that the majority of cases in which the \r\nveto power was used, particularly over the past three \r\ndecades, concerned issues relating to the Arab region.\r\nThe overall and major goal of Security Council \r\nreform and the expansion of its membership are to \r\nensure that all geographical and regional groups \r\nare fairly and proportionately represented within \r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 3/28\r\nan expanded Security Council. In that regard, it is \r\nimportant to recall that the Arab Group represents \r\nnearly 350 million people from 22 countries, which \r\nconstitutes around 12 per cent of the United Nations \r\nmembership. In addition, much of the Security \r\nCouncil’s work and many of the items on its agenda \r\nconcern the Arab region. The Arab Group should \r\ntherefore be fairly and equitably represented within an \r\nexpanded Security Council, so that we can express and \r\nconvey the Arab perspective in the Council and thereby \r\nensure the legitimacy and credibility of its resolutions.\r\nMoreover, the Arab Group calls for full-f ledged \r\npermanent Arab representation in the permanent \r\nmembership category in an overall expanded Council. \r\nFair and equitable geographical representation also \r\nrequires Arab representation in the non-permanent \r\nmembership category in the expanded Council.\r\nIn that regard, I wish to underscore the importance \r\nof the requirement that any documents published in the \r\ncontext of the intergovernmental negotiations should \r\nref lect the accurate stances of all States and groups of \r\nStates, including that of the Arab Group, given that the \r\npositions taken by the various countries should form the \r\nbasis of negotiations on the issue, in line with decision \r\n62/557, so as to uphold the principle of Member States’ \r\nownership of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nIt is now crucial that we improve and develop the \r\nworking methods and procedures of the Security Council \r\nin order to make it more effective and transparent. We \r\nalso need to reach agreement on the Security Council’s \r\nstanding rules of procedure, which should replace \r\nthe provisional rules of procedure that have been in \r\nplace for decades. There is also a need to increase the \r\nnumber of plenary meetings of the Security Council \r\nthat are open to all Members, and to let the relevant \r\nStates participate in the decision-making process on \r\nissues being discussed that are related to them. Those \r\nmeetings would provide non-members of the Council \r\nwith more concrete opportunities to participate in the \r\nCouncil’s debates.\r\nFurthermore, the number of closed meetings and \r\ninformal consultations must be reduced to a minimum, \r\nwith such meetings being the exception rather than the \r\nrule. The Council’s resolutions and statements should \r\nbe considered with the relevant States, which should \r\nbe allowed to participate in the discussion of issues \r\npertaining to them, in accordance with Article 31 of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Arab Group calls on subsidiary bodies and \r\ncommittees of the Security Council to provide Members \r\nof the United Nations with more information regarding \r\nthe work of those bodies. It emphasizes that the Security \r\nCouncil must adhere strictly to its mandate, as defined \r\nby the Charter.\r\nThe Arab Group welcomes the progress made \r\nduring the previous sessions with regard to defining \r\ncommon elements based on the views and proposals of \r\nStates, as well as areas of divergence that require further \r\ndiscussion. The efforts made so far ref lect the numerous \r\ncommon elements among the various positions held \r\nby States and groups of States with regard to the five \r\nagreed categories of reform. At the same time, those \r\nefforts show that there are a number of fundamental \r\ndivergences and different points of view. Any future \r\nprogress will therefore require further debate, in a \r\npositive spirit, to bring those various perspectives \r\ncloser together, in an attempt to find common ground \r\nfor a solution that enjoys the support of the majority of \r\nMember States and achieve the desired comprehensive \r\nand genuine reform of the Security Council.\r\nIn conclusion, the Arab Group is firmly determined \r\nto continue participating constructively in the upcoming \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We stand ready and \r\nwilling to consult with all other negotiating groups in \r\norder to reach a comprehensive and genuine reform of \r\nthe Security Council, within a transparent framework \r\nand in a constructive spirit.\r\nMr. Kai-Kai (Sierra Leone): I have the honour \r\nto deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States.\r\nWe thank you, Madam President, for convening \r\ntoday’s debate on agenda item 124, “Question of \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and other matters \r\nrelated to the Security Council”. We take note of your \r\nopening remarks and wish to reiterate our commitment \r\nto achieving progress on this very important issue.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to congratulate you, \r\nMadam, once again on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session. We look \r\nforward to working with you and all Member States in \r\nachieving the widest possible consensus on the reform \r\nof the Security Council. We would also like to thank the \r\nformer co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nAmbassadors Kaha Imnadze and Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, \r\nPermanent Representatives of Georgia and the United \r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n4/28 18-39080\r\nArab Emirates, respectively, for their stewardship of \r\nthe process during the seventy-second session. We \r\nlook forward to working with the new co-Chairs, \r\nwho were named this morning — Ambassadors Lana \r\nZaki Nusseibeh and Christian Braun — to steer the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process at this seventy-\r\nthird session.\r\nAfrica remains convinced of the need for a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations system, \r\nwhich will significantly contribute to upholding \r\nthe principles, objectives and ideals of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations for a fairer world based on \r\nuniversalism, equity and regional balance. To that \r\nend, we remain true and faithful to decision 62/557 \r\nand other relevant General Assembly decisions for \r\na comprehensive reform of the Security Council on \r\nall five clusters of issues, taking into account their \r\ninterconnectedness. We therefore reject any piecemeal \r\nor selective approach that contradicts and violates the \r\nspirit of comprehensive reform.\r\nThe President of Sierra Leone, Mr. Julius Maada \r\nBio, in his capacity as Coordinator of the African Union \r\nCommittee of Ten Heads of State and Government on \r\nthe reform of the United Nations, reiterated, during the \r\nhigh-level general debate in September, the concerns \r\nof Africa over the continuous failure of the General \r\nAssembly to adopt measures that would enable Africa \r\nto take its rightful place in the Security Council. Let \r\nme echo the Coordinator’s statement:\r\n“The Assembly made a historic pledge during \r\nthe 2005 World Summit to strengthen the United \r\nNations with a view to enhancing its authority and \r\neffectiveness, as well as its capacity to address \r\neffectively, and in accordance with the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter, the full range of the \r\nchallenges of our time. A number of gains have \r\nbeen made, including the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil... Those are laudable gains, but... unless \r\nand until we are able to contend with the reform \r\nof the Security Council, the most critical question \r\nof the day, the Organization will remain seemingly \r\nconstituted on undemocratic and discriminatory \r\nprinciples.” (A/73/PV.10, pp. 23—24)\r\nThe need to reform the Security Council is therefore \r\nmore urgent and imperative than ever. Over the years, \r\nwe have made some progress through heightened \r\nengagement in the intergovernmental negotiations. At \r\nthe same meeting, our President also said:\r\n“We should now endeavour to demonstrate the \r\npolitical will to redress, in particular, the historical \r\ninjustice done to the African continent.\r\n“The present geopolitical realities compel us to \r\ncarry out a comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil... Africa is the only continent without \r\nrepresentation in the permanent category of the \r\nSecurity Council. Africa is also underrepresented \r\nin the non-permanent category. Africa’s demand \r\nfor two permanent seats with all the rights and \r\nprerogatives of current members, including the \r\nright of veto, and for two additional non-permanent \r\nseats is a matter of common justice and the right \r\nto have an equal say in decision-making on issues \r\nthat affect the African region. It is time that we \r\naddressed without any further delay the long-\r\nstanding injustice and imbalance that is being \r\nperpetuated in the present configuration of the \r\nSecurity Council.” (ibid.)\r\nThe urgent need for the comprehensive reform of \r\nthe Security Council cannot be overemphasized. It is \r\nimportant to keep in mind that 1.2 billion of the world’s \r\npopulation of 7.5 billion people are African and that they \r\ncontinue to contribute their fair share to maintaining \r\nworld peace and security. About 70 per cent of the \r\ndecisions made at the Security Council ultimately \r\naffect those 1.2 billion Africans. Almost one-fifth of \r\nthe world’s population is therefore asking why it is \r\nexcluded from the permanent category of the Security \r\nCouncil. In addition, most of the issues discussed in \r\nthe Security Council are related to Africa. In view of \r\nthat, the continent must be in a position to effectively \r\nparticipate in the decision-making processes of all the \r\norgans of the United Nations.\r\nThe Common African Position on Security Council \r\nreform, as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and \r\nthe Sirte Declaration, is well known to the Assembly. \r\nHowever, for the purposes of clarity and precision, \r\nlet me reiterate that Africa demands no less than \r\ntwo permanent seats, with all the prerogatives and \r\nprivileges of permanent membership, including the \r\nright of veto, and five non-permanent seats. Although \r\nAfrica is opposed in principle to the veto, it is of the \r\nview that, for as long as it exists and as a matter of \r\ncommon justice, it should be made available to all \r\npermanent members of the Security Council.\r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 5/28\r\nOur call for the immediate redress of the African \r\ndemand for the equitable representation of Africa in the \r\nSecurity Council continues to garner broad support from \r\nStates Members of the United Nations. In particular, \r\nthe previous co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations recorded in the outcome of the seventy-\r\nsecond session that Member States acknowledged the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of African countries to play their \r\nrightful role on the global stage.\r\nThat development further reinforces the credibility \r\nand viability of the Common African Position on the \r\nreform of the Security Council. It not only builds on the \r\nbroad support that our position continues to garner but \r\nalso signifies that the Common African Position remains \r\nunchallenged in its claim to redress the historical \r\ninjustice resulting from Africa not being represented \r\nin the permanent category and being underrepresented \r\nin the non-permanent category of the Security \r\nCouncil. That is a welcome development on which we \r\nwill continue to build until we achieve a reform that \r\nrecognizes Africa and gives the continent its rightful \r\nplace in global governance at the United Nations.\r\nNotwithstanding those gains, divergences in the \r\nvarious positions of Member States and interest groups \r\non the models of reform, as well as differences over \r\nprocedural matters, continue to challenge the overall \r\nprogress on the effort to build consensus on all five \r\nclusters of the intergovernmental negotiations. The \r\nco-Chairs’ paper, entitled “Revised elements of \r\ncommonality and issues for further consideration”, \r\nwhich was circulated on 14 June by the President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session, \r\nrepresented a welcome step in identifying areas of \r\ncommonality around which Member States can unite \r\nfor consensus-building. The paper did not, however, \r\nadequately and accurately ref lect the Common African \r\nPosition. The adoption of a consensus roll-over \r\ndecision by the General Assembly on 29 June, which \r\ncalled, inter alia, for the immediate continuation of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in informal plenary at \r\nthe seventy-third session of the General Assembly, was \r\nanother significant manifestation of the acceptance of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations as the appropriate \r\nforum to continue to discuss the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIn fulfilment of the forthright vision of our leaders \r\nat the 2005 World Summit, we look forward to working \r\nwith all Member States in an open, transparent and \r\ninclusive Member-driven process, with a view to \r\nachieving the progress that will lead to the ultimate \r\nrealization of the goal of making the Security Council \r\nmore broadly representative, democratic, effective and \r\ntransparent, thereby enhancing the legitimacy of its \r\ndecisions. On the other hand, the status quo undermines \r\nthe principles of equity, legitimacy, accountability and \r\ntransparency, which are core values of multilateralism.\r\nWe have a unique opportunity to keep the \r\ninternational system on the track of dynamic and \r\neffective democratic multilateralism that can ensure \r\nthe role of the United Nations at the centre of global \r\ngovernance. We cannot afford to remain indifferent \r\nto the realities of our rapidly changing global \r\ncircumstances. Africa will continue to advocate \r\nfor a meaningful reform that will make the Security \r\nCouncil more relevant and responsive to the present \r\nand emerging global challenges, and will continue to \r\npromote the core principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Let me reiterate that Africa’s demand for two \r\npermanent seats and two additional non-permanent \r\nseats, as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the \r\nSirte Declaration, provides a framework for correcting \r\nthe historical injustice that the continent continues \r\nto endure.\r\nTo conclude, Africa remains committed to a \r\ncomprehensive reform, as stipulated in decision 62/557 \r\nand other relevant General Assembly decisions. We \r\nremain open to working with all Member States in \r\ncanvassing support for the Common African Position.\r\nMr. Ten-Pow (Guyana): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the 14 States \r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) as \r\nour contribution to today’s debate on the question of \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nAt the outset, CARICOM would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank the Permanent Representatives of \r\nGeorgia and the United Arab Emirates, Ambassadors \r\nKaha Imnadze and Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, respectively, \r\nfor their excellent stewardship of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during the seventy-second session. \r\nWe are glad to have Ambassador Nusseibeh back as \r\nco-Chair, which will ensure a degree of continuity in \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, and we welcome \r\nAmbassador Christian Braun of Luxembourg. \r\nCARICOM will continue to remain engaged in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations under the stewardship \r\nof the new co-Chairs.\r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n6/28 18-39080\r\nThe General Assembly meets annually to debate the \r\ncritical question of the reform of the Security Council. \r\nThat debate is followed by engagements within the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. Member States have \r\nspent many hours over the past several years discussing \r\nthis important question and offering myriad proposals \r\non how we might achieve a reformed Council. Given \r\nthat heavy investment of time and other resources, it \r\nis deeply regrettable that more progress has not been \r\nmade on the long-standing and important issue of \r\nSecurity Council reform. Progress is in the hands of the \r\nMember States, and CARICOM firmly believes that if \r\neach of us summons the political will to go further than \r\nwe have heretofore gone, progress could be achieved.\r\nEvery session that concludes without achieving \r\nany of the goals envisaged in the reform process is a \r\nstark reminder that the imbalances that exist in the \r\nCouncil will continue to be perpetuated through the \r\nmaintenance of the status quo. Those imbalances \r\ninclude the exclusion of entire regions — specifically \r\nAfrica and my own region of Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean — from the permanent category of \r\nmembership. The perpetuation of those imbalances \r\nhas effectively meant that nearly 50 per cent of the \r\ncurrent membership of the United Nations remains \r\nexcluded from permanent membership of one of its \r\nprincipal organs.\r\nThe perpetuation of that imbalance has also meant \r\nthat the composition of the Security Council has not \r\nkept up with the evolution in the membership of the \r\nOrganization and therefore raises concerns about \r\nits representativeness. In 1993, when the General \r\nAssembly established the Open-ended Working Group \r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and \r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council \r\nand Other Matters related to the Security Council in \r\norder to consider matters related to the reform of the \r\nCouncil, its decision was based on the recognition of\r\n“the need to review the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil... in view of the substantial increase in \r\nthe membership of the United Nations, especially \r\nof developing countries, as well as the changes in \r\ninternational relations” (resolution 48/26, fourth \r\npreambular paragraph).\r\nThe perpetuation of the status quo has also meant \r\nthat the work of the Security Council continues to \r\nmiss out on the benefit of important perspectives \r\nand experience. As you are aware, Madam, CARICOM \r\nadvocates for a guaranteed presence of small island \r\ndeveloping States on the Council. We believe that, given \r\nits unique experiences, that group of Member States has \r\nimportant contributions to make to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. With the continued \r\nlack of progress on reform, however, CARICOM’s \r\nadvocacy has not yet achieved the desired end.\r\nIn your statement prior to the opening of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session on 18 September, \r\nyou rightly observed that “the Security Council must \r\nadapt to new political realities”. CARICOM supports \r\nthat view and notes that the United Nations continues \r\nto affirm the value of multilateralism and equitable \r\ninvolvement in decision-making. On that basis, the \r\nSecurity Council must be restructured in a way that \r\nprovides opportunities for equitable involvement in \r\nthe peace and security questions of which the Council \r\nis seized.\r\nAs we approach the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform during this \r\nsession, CARICOM takes this opportunity to share \r\nits expectations going forward. First, we hope to have \r\ncontinuity and to build on what has already been done. \r\nWe believe that the revised elements of commonality \r\nand issues for further consideration paper, circulated \r\non 14 June, should be one of the principal bases for \r\nour work during this session. While the paper captures \r\nmany of the perspectives expressed regarding the five \r\npillars of negotiation, we believe that there is still scope \r\nto further shape its substance. CARICOM underscores \r\nthe need for responses to the expressed wishes of the \r\nmembership and, in the spirit of transparency, the \r\nneed to avoid the exclusion of ideas in any revisions of \r\nthe paper.\r\nSecondly, CARICOM emphasizes the importance \r\nof respecting the voices and views of every Member \r\nState. Reform of the Security Council is a particularly \r\nsensitive issue, and there are many divergent positions \r\non the process and substance of the reform. However, \r\nCARICOM believes that, as sovereign States, every \r\none of us can contribute meaningfully to the dialogue \r\non Security Council reform. Maximum participation \r\nshould be encouraged as a means of enhancing the \r\nlegitimacy of the process.\r\nThirdly and finally, CARICOM hopes that the \r\nmeetings this year can achieve some concrete and \r\nactionable outcomes. We have spent many years \r\nelaborating our positions, and CARICOM hopes \r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 7/28\r\nthat we can find a way to go beyond that in the \r\nupcoming months.\r\nIn conclusion, I thank you, Madam President, for \r\norganizing this important debate and assure you of \r\nCARICOM’s full commitment to the early and urgent \r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\nMs. Miguel (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): I \r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the L.69 group, \r\na diverse group of countries — the majority of which \r\nare small States from Africa, Latin America, the \r\nCaribbean, Asia and the Pacific — that are united by a \r\ncommon cause, namely, the need to achieve lasting and \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council.\r\nWe thank you, Madam, for convening this meeting \r\nand for your thoughtful words. The L.69 group believes \r\nthat your continued involvement in the issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform is critical to our ability to move the \r\nprocess forward.\r\nWe are also grateful to the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session, His Excellency \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák, and the previous co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform, Her Excellency Mrs. Lana Nusseibeh and His \r\nExcellency Mr. Kaha Imnadze, who led the process \r\nwith skill. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nthe recently appointed co-Chairs, Her Excellency \r\nMrs. Lana Nusseibeh and His Excellency Mr. Christian \r\nBraun. The L.69 group stands ready to engage with \r\nthem to consolidate the gains made in previous sessions \r\nand to work towards text-based negotiations. They can \r\nrest assured of our support.\r\nShepherding that process in today’s world is no \r\neasy task. We have engaged in more than 25 years of \r\ndiscussion on this topic and have maintained it on the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly for over 40 years. \r\nWe have produced volumes of documents, delivered \r\nnumerous statements and, on countless occasions, \r\nexpressed our desire to see tangible expressions of the \r\npolitical will for a reformed Security Council that has \r\nbeen professed by all Member States for many years. \r\nNevertheless, we still do not have a text on which to \r\nbase our negotiations. Over the past two years, the L.69 \r\ngroup has highlighted the fact that at least 164 Member \r\nStates have called for text-based negotiations. In the \r\nprevious session, the L.69 group produced a handbook \r\ncompiling important documents from the past 25 years \r\nof deliberations on Security Council reform. In doing \r\nso, we were motivated by the need to highlight the \r\namount of work, time, diplomatic resources and sheer \r\neffort that has been expended on the advancement of \r\nthis process.\r\nOur sustained commitment to reform is of \r\nparticular importance at this time. The world is \r\nexperiencing fissures in the fabric of the rules-based \r\nmultilateral order, which have laid bare the dysfunction \r\nand paralysis that have increasingly gripped the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThere is, however, an antidote to the malady that \r\nhas aff licted the Council, which remains caught in the \r\ngrip of a fever that it cannot break. The remedy lies in \r\nour hands, which must work through the vital organ of \r\nour Organization, namely, the General Assembly. This \r\nis as it should be, as it is the General Assembly that is \r\ncharged with the duty of recommending\r\n“measures for the peaceful adjustment of any \r\nsituation, regardless of origin, which it deems \r\nlikely to impair the general welfare or friendly \r\nrelations among nations”.\r\nAs we prepare for our eleventh session of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, we hope that our \r\nfervour for multilateralism and commitment to \r\nachieving a well-functioning and representative \r\nSecurity Council will imbue our deliberations with the \r\nsense of hope and vitality that is required to make the \r\nUnited Nations a vital and energetic organism, heavily \r\nengaged, day after day, in the practical job of resolving \r\nthe worst problems through cooperation among nations.\r\nBut what can we do to make the United Nations \r\na better, if not the perfect, international organization, \r\nstarting with its most visible organ? First, by making \r\nthe Security Council truly representative, including \r\nthrough expansion in the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership; secondly, by making good on \r\nour leaders’ promise of early Security Council reform \r\nmade at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly; \r\nthirdly, by showing our people that we are serious about \r\nour commitments by moving from rhetoric to action; \r\nand fourthly, by fashioning the Security Council into a \r\nforum where multilateral engagement leads to lasting \r\ninternational peace and security. This fourth point is \r\nparticularly relevant as we debate ways to reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to multilateralism. In that vein, movement \r\non this stalled process will represent a reaffirmation of \r\ncommitment to multilateralism.\r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n8/28 18-39080\r\nThe L.69 group believes that transparency is \r\nkey in moving the process forward. We ask that the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly convene another \r\nplenary meeting under this agenda item in the next \r\nresumed session to facilitate more discussions in \r\nthe open. As a housekeeping matter, the L.69 group \r\nwould like to request the calendar of meetings for the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform as far in advance as possible. However, we \r\nmust also ensure that we are not unduly constrained \r\nin our planning. In keeping with the need for more \r\ndialogue, we suggest that the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations calendar be open so as to allow as many \r\nmeetings as possible. Moreover, we must not start \r\nfrom scratch. Let us begin where we left off, with the \r\npaper we discussed during the previous session of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nBefore closing, I would like to note that, while \r\nprogress on this agenda item has been slow, we have \r\nmade a few gains. For instance, at the previous session, \r\nthe Common African Position — also supported by the \r\nL.69 group — received overwhelming support in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. Further work was done \r\nto build on the papers produced in previous sessions, \r\nand we are committed to making further progress this \r\nyear. In that regard, the L.69 group supports the African \r\nGroup’s request to have its position better ref lected in \r\nthe revised elements of commonality and issues for \r\nfurther consideration paper.\r\nThe seventy-fifth anniversary of the United \r\nNations will soon be upon us; let us not be weighed in \r\nthe balance and found wanting.\r\nMr. Akbaruddin (India): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the members of the \r\nGroup of Four — Brazil, Germany, Japan and my own \r\ncountry, India. We thank you, Madam President, for \r\norganizing this annual debate on an issue that remains \r\ncentral to the reform of the Organization. As the late \r\nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated, and \r\nSecretary-General Guterres reiterated, “no reform of \r\nthe United Nations will be complete without the reform \r\nof the Security Council” (A/61/1, para. 161).\r\nAt the outset, let me begin by expressing my \r\ngratitude to the President of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-second session, His Excellency \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák, and the previous co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform, Her Excellency Mrs. Lana Nusseibeh and His \r\nExcellency Mr. Kaha Imnadze, for their contribution to \r\nthe progress of this important process. They have left \r\nus with a result on which we can build. We hope that \r\nyou, Madam President, and your team will effectively \r\ncarry the baton handed over to you by making credible \r\nprogress at this session, too. In that context, we note \r\nyour announcement of the appointment of the co-Chairs \r\nfor the current session and look forward to seeing them \r\nstart to move the process forward.\r\nThe views of the Group of Four on Security Council \r\nreforms are well-established. The Group of Four \r\nsupports the early reform of the Council, and we seek \r\nexpansion of both the permanent and the non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership to enhance the Council’s \r\nlegitimacy, effectiveness and representativeness. We \r\nalso desire an improvement in its working methods. It \r\nis our conviction that this sentiment is indeed shared \r\nby a broad majority of States Members of the United \r\nNations, including several of the groups on whose \r\nbehalf representatives spoke earlier, namely, the Group \r\nof African States, the Caribbean Community, the Group \r\nof Arab States, the L.69 group and a vast number of \r\nindividual States.\r\nThe intergovernmental process has been under way \r\nfor a decade, and yet we have very little progress to \r\nshow, despite all the efforts by Member States over the \r\nyears. Next year will mark 40 years since the request to \r\ninclude the question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council on \r\nthe General Assembly’s agenda.\r\nAt a time when old challenges to peace and \r\nsecurity have become more intense and the variety of \r\nnew threats is expanding, we cannot afford to delay \r\nthe reform of the body charged with the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. The emphasis on \r\nreform and change was a constant theme in addresses \r\ngiven during the high-level debate of the General \r\nAssembly. In several debates since then, the desire for \r\nchange has been repeated, including during the open \r\ndebate on multilateralism in the Security Council \r\nearlier this month (see S/PV.8395).\r\nWords now need to be followed by actions if we \r\nwish to achieve credible progress at the current session. \r\nAfter a decade of discussions, it is time to normalize \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations process. We need to \r\nbegin negotiations in the same way as we have begun \r\nother intergovernmental processes. For that to happen, \r\ncertain steps need to be taken. Allow me to elaborate.\r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 9/28\r\nFirst, we must start where we culminated our \r\ndeliberations at the previous session. We had a document \r\nthat we were discussing: the paper on revised elements \r\nof commonality and issues for further consideration. \r\nWe need not reinvent the wheel at this session. We need \r\nto start our deliberations by addressing issues where \r\nwe left them in that paper. The document that served \r\nas the basis of our past discussions can be the starting \r\npoint of an open and transparent way forward during \r\nthis session. We need to complete the tasks that we were \r\nunable to complete at the previous session for want of \r\nadequate time. For our part, as the Group of Four, we \r\nwould like an accurate ref lection of key elements of \r\nthe positions of all groups to be included in the paper, \r\nfor example, the Common African Position, which has \r\ngarnered the support of a very large segment of the \r\ntotal membership.\r\nSecondly, we must endeavour to foster dialogue, \r\nnot hinder it. It is our belief that the more opportunities \r\nthere are for dialogue, the greater the chances for \r\nmaking progress. Taking cues from success stories of \r\nthe previous session, we suggest that our discussions \r\non Security Council reform should begin as early as \r\npossible and that there should not be any artificial \r\ndeadlines to end discussions prematurely in June. \r\nContinuous dialogue, for example, helped to resolve \r\ndifferences and reach agreement on important matters \r\nrelating to global health at the end of the seventy-\r\nsecond session.\r\nThirdly, the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nshould operate under normal rules of procedure, like \r\nall other General Assembly processes. At the General \r\nAssembly, we carry out our work through give-and-\r\ntake negotiations, focused on a document, with the \r\nco-Chairs or facilitators acting as agents for facilitating \r\ndialogue. At the General Assembly, all a naysayer can \r\ndo is, at worst, to cast a negative vote. What we have \r\nseen in the past couple of years is no credit to any of \r\nus. Naysayers cannot be allowed to cast a dark shadow \r\nover the entire membership and hold the overwhelming \r\nmajority back. Some among us cannot be permitted to \r\nhold the entire process hostage by bending the rules \r\nof negotiations. If we permit that, we run the risk of \r\nbreaking the process beyond repair.\r\nCredible progress on this issue, Madam President, \r\nwill require your commitment and leadership and \r\nsupporting efforts in facilitating discussions between \r\nthe various groups and countries. The Group of Four, \r\nwhile holding a common position, is also respectful \r\nof the different positions existing in this process. We \r\nare committed to negotiating with all groups but, for \r\nnegotiations to be meaningful, it is essential to list the \r\nvarious aspects of the various positions. It is therefore \r\ncrucial that we work on a text for negotiations.\r\nThe desire for text-based negotiations is not a \r\nslogan. It is a necessity for a transparent negotiating \r\nprocess in good faith. A text that ref lects all the \r\npositions and proposals of Member States will be a \r\nmark of the process’s credibility going forward. If we \r\nfail, we must not hesitate to take another look at the \r\nprocess itself. We remain open to all options.\r\nNext year, the presidency will be handed over \r\nto an African President of the General Assembly, \r\nwho will usher us all into the seventy-fifth year of \r\nthe Organization. Let our work at this session do the \r\naspirations of our people justice, especially those on \r\nthe African continent, so that we can find a way to \r\ncorrect the historical injustice to Africa and address \r\ntheir sense of grievance. For our part, I assure you, \r\nMadam President, that you will find the Group of Four \r\non the side of progress and forward movement.\r\nMrs. Zappia (Italy): On behalf of the Uniting for \r\nConsensus (UFC) group, I wish to thank you, Madam \r\nPresident, for convening this annual debate on Security \r\nCouncil reform and commend you for your commitment \r\nto a reform process that is credible, transparent \r\nand inclusive. Building on those same principles, the \r\nUFC group looks forward to cooperating with the \r\nnew co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform, Ambassadors Lana \r\nNusseibeh and Christian Braun. We warmly welcome \r\nthem in their new capacities and wish to express our full \r\nsupport for them in the upcoming intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations session.\r\nThis year marks the tenth anniversary of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. In decision 62/557, \r\nadopted on 15 September 2008, the General Assembly \r\nagreed to start intergovernmental negotiations “in \r\ngood faith, with mutual respect and in an open, \r\ninclusive and transparent manner”. Over the years, \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations have met those \r\nexpectations. There has always been transparency \r\nand inclusivity, and the discussions have enabled us \r\nto identify broad convergences among Member States. \r\nThose convergences include the fact that an increase in \r\nnon-permanent seats is supported by all Member States \r\nand provides common ground for advancing Security \r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n10/28 18-39080\r\nCouncil reform; that all Member States agree that such \r\nan expansion of seats should favour underrepresented \r\nregions of the world; and that a significant, growing \r\nnumber of Member States oppose expanding the \r\nveto to other States and instead support limiting or \r\nabolishing it.\r\nOur deliberations have already had an impact \r\non the current working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil. More transparency, open-format meetings, \r\ninformative briefings and better access to information \r\nhave already improved the Council’s performance. \r\nHowever, our work is far from complete. We need to do \r\nmore to achieve the broadest possible consensus on a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council.\r\nIn past years, the UFC group has complemented \r\nour participation in intergovernmental negotiations \r\nmeetings with a series of informal consultations \r\nwith other negotiating groups. The purpose of \r\nthose consultations has been to explore and identify \r\ncommon ground, in parallel with the efforts of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to narrow differences \r\namong Member States. One of the most recurrent \r\nconcerns that we have heard is the question of the \r\nnumber of opportunities that Member States will have \r\nto serve on an enlarged Security Council. Looking \r\nahead, we believe that that specific question should be \r\nat the centre of our debates.\r\nThe General Assembly needs to properly address \r\nthe request of Africa to correct its underrepresentation \r\non the Council. The General Assembly must consider \r\nthe growing importance of the Asia-Pacific and Latin \r\nAmerican regions and grant them a more equitable \r\nrepresentation. Arab countries are asking for a more \r\nproportionate and more stable representation than the \r\nswing seat they currently have.\r\nWe should listen to the call of over 60 \r\ncountries — mainly small States and small island \r\ndeveloping States — that have never had the \r\nopportunity to serve on the Council and will rarely have \r\nthe opportunity to do so without proper reform. We \r\nshould also heed the appeal of the 23 Eastern European \r\ncountries that wish to obtain one more seat, thereby \r\nincreasing their chances of serving on the Council.\r\nIn calling attention to those appeals and in a true \r\nspirit of f lexibility, the UFC group has brought to the \r\ntable the most detailed and comprehensive proposal, \r\ntrying to take the demands of all negotiating groups \r\ninto consideration. Our proposal is the result of \r\nmany adjustments made over the years in response to \r\nfeedback from the various rounds of negotiations.\r\nOur proposal is to create new, longer-term \r\nnon-permanent seats with the possibility of immediate \r\nre-election and to increase the number of two-year \r\nnon-permanent seats, coupled with a more equitable \r\ndistribution of seats among regional groups. The \r\nlonger-term seats would fulfil the legitimate desire of \r\nsome Member States to make a greater contribution to \r\nthe work of the Council and, at the same time, foster a \r\nfairer system of rotation.\r\nThe Security Council would consist, then, of \r\n26 members. That would include 21 non-permanent \r\nseats, assigned as follows: six seats for the Group of \r\nAfrican States, three of which would be longer-term \r\nseats; five seats for the Group of Asia-Pacific States, \r\nthree of which would be longer-term seats; four seats \r\nfor the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, \r\ntwo of which would be longer-term seats; three seats \r\nfor the Group of Western European and other States, \r\none of which would be a longer-term seat; two seats \r\nfor the Group of Eastern European States; and one seat \r\nreserved for small island developing States or small \r\nStates. The latter would be a rotating seat, which would \r\nnot prevent them from running within their regional \r\ngroup, but would instead be an additional way for them \r\nto gain access to the Security Council.\r\nAttached to the statement that we have circulated \r\nare copies of the breakdown of our regional \r\nrepresentation proposal and a comparison between the \r\npresent Security Council and the one that we envisage. \r\nEveryone benefits, and everyone gains greater \r\naccess to the Council under our proposal. No one \r\nloses out, and the Council’s ability to take decisions \r\nremains undiminished.\r\nMultilateralism has been debated in various \r\nforums recently. There is a widespread consensus \r\nthat Security Council reform is needed to strengthen \r\nmultilateralism. In order to foster the trust of public \r\nopinion in this institution, the Security Council needs to \r\nbecome truly representative, accountable, democratic, \r\ntransparent and effective. We should not aim to enlarge \r\nthe small circle of permanent members, but rather to \r\ngive all Member States — even the smallest ones — a \r\ngreater chance to contribute to finding solutions for \r\nthe maintenance of peace and security. Concerning \r\nthe veto, we fail to see how the addition of new vetoes \r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 11/28\r\nwould make a new Council more effective and more \r\nresponsive to international crises.\r\nFor many years, the UFC group has pointed to the \r\nmain obstacle to reform, namely, the demand for an \r\nincrease in the number of permanent members. After 25 \r\nyears of focusing only on demands for new permanent \r\nseats, which would benefit just a handful of Member \r\nStates, it is high time to give a concrete chance to all \r\nMember States. It is high time to offer real prospects to \r\nthe groups of States and regions of the world that are \r\nunderrepresented on the Council.\r\nTo move the process forward, the UFC group is \r\nready to cooperate with you, Madam President, as \r\nwell as with the co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations and the membership as a whole. Our \r\ncommon goal must be to increase the Council’s \r\nlegitimacy in the eyes of both the general membership \r\nand international public opinion. That would enhance \r\nthe Council’s authority and, ultimately, its effectiveness. \r\nWe are ready to redouble our efforts to achieve reform, \r\nbuilding on the many convergences that exist among \r\nMember States.\r\nMrs. Ellertsdottir (Iceland): I am speaking on \r\nbehalf of the Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, \r\nNorway, Sweden and my own country, Iceland.\r\nLet me start by thanking Ambassador Nusseibeh \r\nand Ambassador Braun for agreeing to co-chair the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform during this session. We wish them success in \r\nthat important task.\r\nI reaffirm the commitment of the Nordic countries \r\nto engage in the collective effort to reform the Security \r\nCouncil. The complex political and multifaceted \r\nchallenges we face globally today also have a direct \r\nimpact on the role of the United Nations. It is more \r\nimportant than ever that the Security Council becomes \r\nmore transparent, more effective, more accountable and \r\nmore representative. We are encouraged by the steady \r\nprogress on United Nations reform that is currently \r\nenergizing the work of the Secretariat and Member \r\nStates, particularly the ongoing efforts to enhance the \r\nefficiency and transparency of the Council’s work in \r\nits existing format. We look forward to listening to and \r\nworking with other Member States from all regions in \r\nsupport of continued reforms.\r\nThe Nordic countries support a balanced expansion \r\nof the Security Council. The aim must be to better \r\nref lect the current global political and economic \r\nrealities and to ensure increased representation of \r\ndeveloping countries, including both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent seats for Africa. In our view, it is \r\nalso important to enable possibilities for small States \r\nto participate in the decision-making process of the \r\nSecurity Council as elected members.\r\nToday, as we embark on a new intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations session, we welcome the co-Chairs’ \r\noutlining of the forthcoming meetings and their \r\ninvitation to explore potential elements of convergence \r\nso that we can move forward in a frank dialogue on the \r\nimportant issue of Security Council reform. We join \r\nothers in calling for the commencement of text-based \r\nnegotiations. We see that as the best way to harness \r\nthe progress achieved to date in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process and to move it forward. Rest \r\nassured that the Nordic countries will contribute to a \r\nconstructive dialogue among Member States, with a \r\nview to achieving further progress during this session.\r\nMr. Kim Song (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): At present, Security Council reform is one of \r\nthe core elements of the reform of the United Nations \r\nwith the aim of enabling the Council to better carry \r\nout its mission to ensure peace and security in the \r\nworld. The Security Council is one of the major organs \r\nof the United Nations. It has a fundamental mandate \r\nto safeguard world peace and security and plays an \r\nimportant role in building a peaceful and stable world.\r\nHowever, nowadays the principles of respect for \r\nsovereignty, equality and non-intervention are openly \r\ndisregarded in the Security Council, and interference \r\nin internal affairs, pressure and infringement on the \r\nindependence of sovereign States continue unabated. \r\nMore than 70 years have passed since the United Nations \r\nwas founded. Nevertheless, the Security Council, which \r\nis becoming infested with unilateralism, has turned \r\ninto the Insecurity Council. If the Security Council is \r\nto fully carry out its mandate, it should firmly ensure \r\ninternational justice and impartiality for the benefit \r\nof all Member States and not just strategically benefit \r\ncertain countries. The delegation of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea would hereby like to \r\nclarify its principled position with regard to Security \r\nCouncil reform.\r\nFirst, Security Council reform should be carried \r\nout based on the principle of ensuring international \r\njustice, impartiality and democracy. Carrying out \r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n12/28 18-39080\r\nSecurity Council reform on the principle of ensuring \r\ninternational justice, impartiality and democracy \r\nmeans building a Security Council where the principles \r\nof sovereign equality, non-intervention and the \r\npeaceful resolution of conflict — which, as stated in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, are the foundation of \r\ninternational relations — are strictly observed.\r\nSecondly, Security Council reform should be \r\ncarried out based on the principle of ensuring the \r\nfull representation of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries and other developing countries, which make \r\nup the majority of Member States. Therefore, providing \r\nthose countries with full and equal representation is \r\nan absolute necessity for building a democratically \r\nstrengthened Security Council. Intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform should \r\nhave begun over 10 years ago. There are still many \r\ndifferent views with regard to increasing the number \r\nof permanent seats on the Security Council. In that \r\ncontext, the most feasible way to solve the problem is \r\nto proceed by increasing the number of non-permanent \r\nseats ahead of all other reforms. We regard that as one \r\nof the ways to help correct the unequal composition of \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThirdly, the delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea strongly opposes Japan’s aspirations \r\nfor a permanent seat on the Security Council. Japan is a \r\nwar criminal State that in the past invaded many Asian \r\ncountries by force and committed heinous crimes \r\nagainst humanity. Although more than 70 years have \r\npassed since the end of the Second World War, Japan \r\nhas not admitted to its past crimes; rather, it continues \r\nto defy the international community by sugar-coating \r\nits history. To give Japan, a country that committed \r\nthe gravest crimes against humanity, a permanent seat \r\non the Security Council would be nothing short of a \r\nmockery of human conscience and a disgrace to the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea continues to hope that \r\nthe sincere efforts of all Member States for Security \r\nCouncil reform will achieve success and meet the high \r\nexpectations of the international community.\r\nMs. Brink (Australia): At the outset, I would like to \r\nthank Ambassadors Imnadze and Nusseibeh for leading \r\nthe important process of Security Council reform \r\nduring the seventy-second session. Australia also \r\nwarmly welcomes the reappointment of Ambassador \r\nNusseibeh and the appointment of Ambassador Braun \r\nas co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations for \r\nthis session.\r\nThe international rules and institutions that support \r\nsecurity and stability and promote collective responses \r\nto global challenges are under significant strain. \r\nThe Security Council is one of the most important \r\nmechanisms that we have to support the rules-based \r\ninternational order, sitting, as it does, at the apex of \r\nthe peace and security pillar of this Organization. \r\nWe need to ensure that it is as effective as possible. \r\nAustralia has long called for Security Council reform. \r\nWe believe that there is a clear consensus to the effect \r\nthat substantive reform of the Council is well overdue \r\nand that the membership should act on that issue. But, \r\nas a group, we have not delivered.\r\nAs one of the founding members of the United \r\nNations, Australia has been calling for ways to increase \r\nthe effectiveness and legitimacy of the Security \r\nCouncil since the Organization was created. Increased \r\ntransparency and limits on the use of the veto have \r\nbeen our ongoing themes. The document from the past \r\nsession entitled “Revised elements of commonality and \r\nissues for further consideration” was a step forward. \r\nHowever, to date there has been only minor, incremental \r\nprogress, and it is clear that we need to change our \r\napproach. Converging consensus is a reasonable aim, \r\nbut it is proving to be very slow to materialize. As we \r\nknow from our other work at the United Nations, text-\r\nbased negotiations can accelerate consensus. It is time \r\nthat we moved from statements in meetings like this \r\none to drafts.\r\nAustralia supports greater representation on the \r\nCouncil for Asia, Latin America and Africa in order \r\nto ref lect contemporary geopolitical realities. We agree \r\nthat an expanded Council should still be able to act \r\nswiftly and decisively, within limits. We support the \r\nrestraint on the use of the veto in situations of mass \r\natrocity. And we support improvements to the Council’s \r\nworking methods in order to enable the effective \r\noperation of those reforms. We do not underestimate \r\nthe complexity of that task. There are diverging views \r\nand differing interests. Deliberations in the current \r\nformat on Council reform have now been held for more \r\nthan 25 years. If the task were easy, we would have \r\nsolved it by now. But we deal with complex tasks every \r\nday. Australia joins its voice and its commitment to \r\nthe efforts aimed at reforming the Security Council \r\nso that it may be more legitimate and more effective \r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 13/28\r\nin carrying out its crucial function in support of \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMr. Elmajerbi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I thank you, Madam President, for convening this \r\nmeeting on agenda item 124 concerning the question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and other matters \r\nrelated to the Security Council. My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statement delivered by the representative \r\nof the Republic of Sierra Leone, which represents the \r\nCommon African Position, and the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of Kuwait, which represents the \r\nposition of the Group of Arab States.\r\nWe hope to begin a serious negotiation process \r\naimed at achieving the desired objectives in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, which will lead to \r\nan unprecedented reform in the work of the Council \r\nand should allow us to achieve the noble objectives of \r\nour Organization. My country’s delegation would like \r\nto thank all those who have participated in previous \r\nnegotiations, whether delegations, co-Chairs or \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations primarily \r\nseeks to regulate inter-State relations and to prevent \r\ncrises, wars and catastrophes, which are caused by the \r\nbehaviour of certain States. Such behaviour is restrained \r\nby international legal rules and the implementation of \r\npre-emptive and deterrent diplomacy. That depends, in \r\nthe first place, on the collective will of States, which \r\nmust also work in good faith within the principles of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nToday’s world has witnessed major new \r\ndevelopments, nothing like those seen in the 1940s and \r\nthe 1950s. We therefore need to take important and \r\nnecessary measures that have been imposed on us by the \r\nnew circumstances, which make it imperative to carry \r\nout reforms to the main organ of the United Nations \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, namely, the Security Council. Those \r\nreforms should be holistic and should focus on the five \r\naspects of the reform process, including the question \r\nof equitable geographic representation, especially with \r\nregard to the African continent.\r\nAfrica has 54 States Members of the United \r\nNations. However, it is not equitably represented in the \r\nSecurity Council, even though more than 75 per cent \r\nof the agenda items before the Council are related to \r\nAfrica. In that regard, all States Members of the United \r\nNations should recognize that the time has come to \r\naddress the historical injustice that has been done to \r\nthe African continent and to consider Africa’s demands \r\nas legitimate, realistic and applicable. The Common \r\nAfrican Position has been reaffirmed by the States \r\nof the African continent on a number of occasions, \r\nas stipulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \r\nDeclaration, which call for two permanent seats on the \r\nSecurity Council for the African continent with all \r\nthe privileges of permanent seats, including the veto \r\npower, as well as two non-permanent seats.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the position that has \r\nbeen taken by members of the General Assembly on \r\nresuming the intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\nmatters related to the Security Council. We would like \r\nto stress that we must do our utmost to reach a common \r\nunderstanding on the way in which we can proceed \r\nand achieve our desired objectives concerning that \r\nlong overdue process, given the agreement on certain \r\nissues and common ground. My delegation would also \r\nlike to emphasize the need to start serious negotiations, \r\ngiven the urgent need to reform the Security Council \r\nand develop its working methods in a transparent \r\nand democratic way. That would contribute to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, while \r\nallowing all parties concerned to participate in all of \r\nthe discussions of the Council.\r\nIntergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council require a holistic view of all aspects \r\nof those reforms, while taking into account the need to \r\nexpedite them. That cannot happen, as Members know, \r\nwithout demonstrating collective will and recognizing \r\nthe injustice that has been done with regard to Africa’s \r\nrepresentation on the Security Council, as well as \r\nthe Council’s non-democratic methods of work, \r\nas some have said. Even some countries that have \r\nenjoyed non-permanent membership of the Council \r\nhave complained about the control of the permanent \r\nmembers over the Council’s work. In addition, the \r\ntwo-year membership of the Council is too brief to \r\nallow non-permanent members to make a contribution. \r\nWe also believe that there is a need to develop the \r\nrelationship between the Council and the General \r\nAssembly, the body that represents all Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, in a way that can achieve harmony in \r\nthe work of the two organs without allowing an overlap. \r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n14/28 18-39080\r\nThose two organs should not appear to be working in \r\ntwo different organizations.\r\nTo conclude, my delegation reiterates its readiness \r\nto participate in the new round of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on reforming the Security Council. We \r\nhope that the new round will be the beginning of a \r\nserious process that will achieve the desired objectives \r\nand transform the most important organ of the United \r\nNations into an effective one that can accomplish \r\nits duties as required. That would also correct the \r\nhistorical injustice with regard to the representation of \r\ncertain regions and would change the working methods \r\nof the Council, allowing it to work in a transparent and \r\nmore democratic manner.\r\nMr. Sparber (Liechtenstein) At a time when the \r\ninternational rules-based order is under increasing \r\npressure, the world cannot afford a dysfunctional \r\nSecurity Council. The fact that the Council is unable \r\nto act decisively on many of the defining crises of our \r\ntime is in stark contrast to its mandate as set out in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and is also detrimental \r\nto the United Nations. The prolonged standstill in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process compounds an \r\nalready sobering track record of the General Assembly \r\nholding the Security Council accountable for its \r\nperformance. The potential for conflict is rising, and \r\na strong and robust United Nations as the beacon of \r\nmultilateralism is needed more than ever.\r\nIt is imperative that we make the Council more \r\nbroadly representative, efficient and transparent; yet \r\nwe seem to be unable to overcome the current deadlock. \r\nIn the area of enlargement, there is no prospect for \r\nprogress as long as deeply entrenched views on \r\nopposite sides of the discussion prevail. Without any \r\nindication of f lexibility, it is hard to imagine a way \r\nforward. Liechtenstein has actively contributed to the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, and we continue to see \r\nhigh-level engagement by many Member States.\r\nAt the same time, we should have a serious \r\ndiscussion about the fundamentals of this process, \r\nwhich we increasingly see as benefiting most those \r\nthat show the least interest in progress. As is well \r\nknown, Liechtenstein suggested an enlargement model \r\nthat we hoped could provide a middle ground in going \r\nforward — adding a new category of long-term seats \r\nof 8 to 10 years with the possibility of immediate \r\nre-election. The other main elements of our proposal \r\nare no new veto powers, f lexibility to add new two-year \r\nseats, a strong review clause and a f lip-f lop clause that \r\nbars Member States that have lost an election for long-\r\nterm seats from running for short-term seats.\r\nThe enlargement of the Council does not equal \r\nreform. Which States serve on the Council is certainly \r\nan essential question for how the Council is perceived \r\nand for its credibility. How the Council goes about its \r\ndaily business and how it carries out its functions is of no \r\nless importance. We have consistently worked together \r\nwith like-minded States to help the Council do better \r\nin that respect, and we have achieved important results. \r\nThe Ombudsperson to the Security Council Committee \r\npursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and \r\n2253 (2015) concerning ISIL (Da’esh), Al-Qaida and \r\nassociated individuals, groups, undertakings and \r\nentities was an initiative that had its origins outside the \r\nSecurity Council. We see great merit in expanding its \r\nmandate to other sanctions regimes.\r\nAnother key initiative is the code of conduct \r\nsubmitted by the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency (ACT) group for the Security Council to \r\nprevent and end atrocity crimes. We had the honour to \r\nlead the effort in the ACT group that resulted in the \r\ncode of conduct on veto restraint, which is currently \r\nsupported by 118 States, nine of which are current \r\nSecurity Council members. Since 2019, with five new \r\nincoming non-permanent Council members, two-thirds \r\nof the Security Council membership will have signed \r\nthe code. All those States have committed to taking \r\naction to prevent and end atrocity crimes when serving \r\non the Council. Relevant situations to which the code \r\napplies today include Myanmar, Syria and Yemen.\r\nFor Liechtenstein, subscribing to the code of \r\nconduct is the minimum commitment that we expect \r\nof any Council member. We will therefore continue \r\nto support Security Council candidatures only from \r\nStates that have signed the code of conduct, and we \r\ncall on others to do the same. Such a policy can make \r\na tangible contribution to improving the work of the \r\nCouncil, which is one of the very concrete measures \r\nthat members of the Assembly can take while progress \r\non enlargement of the Council eludes us.\r\nMr. Sukhee (Mongolia): Allow me to join previous \r\nspeakers in expressing our genuine appreciation to you, \r\nMadam President, for convening this important debate. \r\nWe welcome your intention and readiness to guide and \r\nmove the Security Council reform process forward \r\ndespite the existing difficulties. I wish to extend our \r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 15/28\r\nthanks to the co-Chairs, Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh \r\nof the United Arab Emirates and Ambassador Kaha \r\nImnadze of Georgia, for their active engagement during \r\nthe previous session and their efforts to make progress \r\nin reforming the Security Council.\r\nWhile aligning my delegation with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines on behalf of the L.69 group of developing \r\ncountries, I would like to add a few remarks in my \r\nnational capacity.\r\nLittle progress has been made despite 25 years \r\nof efforts to reform the Security Council. Those \r\nyears have been marked by the establishment of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the question of \r\nSecurity Council reform in 2008 and its predecessor, \r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question \r\nof Equitable Representation on and Increase in the \r\nMembership of the Security Council, in 1993. The \r\nintergovernmental negotiations have failed so far to \r\nyield a concrete outcome, although their sessions have \r\nresulted in outcome documents, including the latest \r\npaper, entitled “Revised elements of commonality and \r\nissues for further consideration”. In order to realize a \r\ntimely reform of the Security Council — an essential \r\nelement in our overall effort to reform the United \r\nNations — we should urgently commence text-based \r\nnegotiations instead of convening unproductive circular \r\ndiscussions. We are called on to continue our efforts to \r\nachieve the objective of making the Security Council \r\nmore broadly representative, efficient and transparent, \r\nthereby further enhancing its effectiveness and the \r\nlegitimacy of its decisions and their implementation.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nMongolia’s principled position concerning the reform \r\nof the Security Council with regard to the following \r\nkey issues. A just and equitable expansion in both the \r\npermanent and the non-permanent categories should be \r\nmaintained. Our stance in favour of an enlargement of \r\nboth the current categories is guided by considerations \r\nbased on the Council’s composition as defined by \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, and ref lects \r\ncontemporary realities, as well as the principles of \r\njustice and equality. We seek to ensure greater and \r\nenhanced representation of developing countries, \r\nparticularly the non-represented and underrepresented \r\nregional groups.\r\nThe right of veto should be abolished. The use of \r\nthe veto should be restricted in the Security Council, \r\nin particular with regard to Chapter VII–related \r\ndecisions. If the use of the veto is to be maintained, \r\nit should be extended to all new members of the \r\npermanent category of the Security Council, which \r\nmust enjoy all the prerogatives and privileges of \r\npermanent membership, including the right of veto. \r\nAdequate representation of all groups, particularly \r\nnon-represented and underrepresented ones, in both \r\ncategories of the Security Council membership must \r\nbe duly considered. The solution should be fair and \r\njust. We therefore attach great importance to the \r\ncriterion of equitable geographical distribution as we \r\nemphasize the representation of the non-represented \r\nand underrepresented groups, particularly Africa, Asia \r\nand the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States.\r\nWith regard to the non-permanent category, \r\nthe strengthening of a fair and equitable rotation \r\nsystem within a geographical regional group is of \r\nhigh importance to my country. In that respect, my \r\ndelegation also supports the allocation of additional \r\nseats to the current regional groups, while ensuring the \r\nrepresentation of small developing countries.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Maldives): I wish to express my \r\nappreciation to you, Madam President, for convening \r\nthis important debate on the question of the reform \r\nof the Security Council. I would like to thank the \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform, Ambassador Lana Zaki \r\nNusseibeh, Permanent Representative of the United \r\nArab Emirates, and Ambassador Kaha Imnadze, \r\nPermanent Representative of Georgia, for the effective \r\nmanner in which they conducted the process last year.\r\nWhenever we mention the words “United Nations \r\nreform”, we imagine a Security Council that ref lects the \r\nrealities of the world in which we live; a Council whose \r\ndebates, decisions and decision-making processes are \r\nconsistent with the democratic values that we preach \r\nand promote at home; and a Council whose membership, \r\nincluding the manner in which members are elected, \r\nref lects the letter and spirit of the provisions of Article \r\n23 of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nFor the Maldives, a reformed Security Council is \r\none in which there are more permanent members and \r\nthat is more representative and ref lects the political \r\nand economic realities of our time. A reformed \r\nCouncil is one whose membership maintains equitable \r\ngeographical distribution, which the Charter explicitly \r\nrequires. It is our firm belief that every country \r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n16/28 18-39080\r\ndeserves an opportunity to be heard and to have a say. \r\nFor the Maldives, a reformed Council is one whose \r\nmembership comprises developing countries, including \r\nsmall States. That is necessary in order to ref lect the \r\ndiversity of the United Nations membership.\r\nLarger countries, especially those that have served \r\non the Council, have a moral, and a Charter, obligation \r\nto ensure that small States, especially those that \r\nhave not served before, get a fair chance. A reformed \r\nCouncil is one where the candidates for membership do \r\nnot have to spend a fortune on their election. Elections \r\nto membership of the Council have become such that \r\nsmaller States find themselves having to undertake \r\nexpensive campaign practices despite limited \r\nresources. Those that cannot afford to undertake such \r\nexpensive campaigns lose out. We believe that that is \r\nmost certainly why only eight small island developing \r\nStates have managed to secure a seat on the Council \r\nsince the founding of the United Nations. Smaller \r\nStates can bring unique perspectives and fresh ideas \r\nto the Council if they are able to be elected and to \r\nserve. Equitable geographical distribution should not \r\nresemble a principle with a financial price tag. That, \r\nwe believe, is a necessary topic for discussions on the \r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\nA reformed Council must also improve its \r\ndecision-making and implementation processes. There \r\nis a need for the Council to look beyond the traditional \r\ndefinition of security and to include emerging \r\nthreats, such as climate change and sea-level rise as \r\nthreat multipliers. The Maldives has made several \r\nproposals in the past aimed at enabling the Council \r\nto establish a regular consultative dialogue with the \r\nAssembly and the relevant United Nations agencies \r\nso that climate-induced threats to international peace \r\nand security can be addressed in a more holistic and \r\ncoordinated way.\r\nRelevance and resilience are concepts central to \r\nthe legitimacy and effectiveness of any political body. \r\nThe Security Council must be seen to be relevant to the \r\nreal issues and represent the real aspirations of “We \r\nthe people”, the words with which the Charter begins. \r\nIt cannot continue to live in an order shaped by the \r\nenvironment of 1945. Unless it is able to adapt to the \r\nchanges in world politics and be seen to represent the \r\ninternational community, it cannot draw legitimacy \r\nfor its decisions. It is therefore imperative that the \r\nnecessary reforms be brought to the Council in a \r\ntimely fashion.\r\nMr. Vieira (Brazil): Brazil associates itself with the \r\nstatements delivered by the Permanent Representative \r\nof India on behalf of the Group of Four and by the \r\nDeputy Permanent Representative of Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines on behalf of the L.69 group, and wishes \r\nto add a few remarks in its national capacity.\r\nI would like to express the gratitude of my \r\ndelegation to the President of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-second session, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, \r\nand to thank the co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, Ambassadors Lana Nusseibeh of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates and Kaha Imnadze of Georgia, \r\nfor their contribution during the previous session to \r\nadvancing Security Council reform.\r\nI would also like to welcome the reappointment \r\nof Ambassador Nusseibeh and the appointment of \r\nAmbassador Christian Braun of Luxembourg as the \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations during \r\nthe seventy-third session of the General Assembly. \r\nAs always, they can count on Brazil’s full support in \r\ntheir endeavours.\r\nOn 15 September 2008, the General Assembly \r\nadopted decision 62/557, which established the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. That decision was \r\nthe result of the desire of Member States to move \r\nfrom the discussions in the framework of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership \r\nof the Security Council and Other Matters related \r\nto the Security Council to a more results-oriented \r\nprocess that could effectively achieve the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nA decade later, however, we still have not \r\nwitnessed the necessary progress that we had hoped \r\nwould accompany the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nThat progress should not take the form of an endless \r\ndebate on abstract concepts that leads nowhere, which \r\nnot only does not advance the interests of the majority \r\nof Member States but could jeopardize the legitimacy \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations as a whole.\r\nBrazil reiterates its commitment to helping \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, which have \r\nseen considerable progress at recent sessions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. To that end, we must effectively \r\ncommence the long-overdue text-based negotiations. \r\nWe fully support the three-step strategy proposed by \r\nAmbassador Syed Akbaruddin of India, on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Four. Allow me to further elaborate.\r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 17/28\r\nWe need to guarantee continuity in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. During the previous \r\nsession, the co-Chairs — Ambassadors Nusseibeh \r\nand Imnadze — drafted a document entitled “Revised \r\nelements of commonality and issues for further \r\nconsideration” based on the outcome papers of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations of the sixty-ninth, \r\nseventieth and seventy-first General Assembly sessions \r\nand on the statements made from the f loor.\r\nNevertheless, despite all efforts made during that \r\nharmonization exercise, the outcome document is \r\nstill incomplete. What we should do during the next \r\nintergovernmental negotiations is quite clear. We need \r\nto start the session by debating the revised document in \r\norder to ensure that it includes, among other points, the \r\npositions that clearly received overwhelming support \r\nfrom Member States and that were, unfortunately, not \r\ntaken into account.\r\nIn that regard, the identification of the countries \r\nsupporting the various options contained in the text \r\nor the attribution of names and an adequate reference \r\nto the Common African Position are two requests \r\nfrom Member States that enjoyed clear approval from \r\nthe f loor during the seventy-second session. They \r\ndeserve special consideration. In that context, allow \r\nme to underline the importance of correcting the \r\nhistorical injustice done to the African continent by \r\nit not being adequately represented in both categories \r\nof seats — permanent and non-permanent — in the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe need to make full use of the time available \r\nto us. The next meetings of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations should start as early as possible, and we \r\nshould not impose upon ourselves artificial deadlines \r\nfor the conclusion of our debate. More explicitly, there \r\nis no need for the negotiations to end in June, as was the \r\ncase last year, almost three months before the end of the \r\nseventy-second session of the General Assembly. It is \r\nquite common in the General Assembly for important \r\nnegotiation processes to be carried out up until the last \r\ndays of the session — even in August or September. My \r\ndelegation truly believes that negotiations regarding \r\nthe reform of the Security Council are indeed some of \r\nthe most crucial negotiations conducted in the General \r\nAssembly. It is also important that the co-Chairs of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations enjoy f lexibility \r\nin managing their provisional schedule of meetings \r\nso that they can convene as many additional meetings \r\nas necessary.\r\nIn the same vein, we also support the idea that you, \r\nMadam President, convene another plenary meeting \r\nunder this agenda item in the next resumed session, as \r\nproposed by the Deputy Permanent Representative of \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, on behalf of the L.69 \r\ngroup. As some Member States have already stated, \r\nmany of the points related to the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil need further discussion. That is exactly what \r\nwe are proposing — to discuss this complex question \r\nas much as possible during the seventy-third session of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nFinally, we need to make sure that the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations follow the normal rules \r\nof procedure. As I already mentioned, the negotiations \r\non the reform of the Security Council were created by \r\nthe General Assembly and are conducted by the General \r\nAssembly — the most universal decision-making \r\norgan of the United Nations. The General Assembly \r\nincludes 193 Member States, and each Member’s vote \r\nhas equal weight. That is to say, no State has any veto \r\nrights in the Assembly. Therefore, it is not reasonable \r\nthat some countries reserve for themselves the power \r\nof obstructing an entire negotiation when a broad \r\nmajority is working constructively for its development. \r\nIt is necessary to ensure that, like any other process \r\nin the General Assembly, the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations work with a text with identified positions \r\nand proposals, and with the sincere and transparent \r\nengagement of Member States aimed at finding \r\nacceptable compromises. That is what a negotiation \r\nis, and that is what the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nshould truly become in order to keep States Members \r\nof the Organization committed to that exercise.\r\nI have no doubt, Madam President, of your strong \r\ncommitment to reforming the Security Council in \r\norder to make it more representative and fit to face \r\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. We look \r\nforward to working with the new co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nMr. Gafoor (Singapore): I thank you, Madam \r\nPresident, for your leadership and your personal \r\nengagement on this very important issue. I join \r\nprevious speakers in thanking Ambassadors Kaha \r\nImnadze of Georgia and Lana Nusseibeh of the United \r\nArab Emirates for their hard work over the past year as \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations at the \r\nprevious session. I also welcome your announcement, \r\nMadam President, that you will reappoint Ambassador \r\nLana Nusseibeh and appoint Ambassador Christian \r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n18/28 18-39080\r\nBraun of Luxembourg. We wish them good luck, and \r\nwe commend their courage in taking on this very \r\nimportant assignment.\r\nDuring the high-level week, much was said by \r\nour leaders about the need to strengthen and reinforce \r\nmultilateralism and the multilateral rules-based system. \r\nA critical part of our multilateral architecture is the \r\nSecurity Council. As we look for ways to strengthen \r\nand reinforce multilateralism, we cannot ignore the \r\nimportant question of Council reform. Indeed, we need \r\nto make the Council more effective, accountable and \r\nrepresentative if we are to strengthen our multilateral \r\nsystem. All members of the United Nations would \r\nbenefit from the reform of the Council. Let me make a \r\ncounter-intuitive point — the greatest beneficiaries of \r\nSecurity Council reform will, in fact, be the permanent \r\nmembers because, ultimately, any reform will enhance \r\nthe credibility of the Council and that, in turn, will \r\nenhance the legitimacy of the permanent members as \r\nthey discharge their special responsibilities. I would \r\ntherefore urge the five permanent members to embrace \r\nthe need for reform and to lead the process from the \r\nfront rather than from the rear.\r\nIt is evident that vast differences in opinion remain \r\namong Member States on the issue of Security Council \r\nreform. In that regard, Singapore believes that the \r\nupdated paper circulated in June, entitled “Revised \r\nelements of commonality and issues for further \r\nconsideration”, broadly ref lects the current state of \r\ndiscussions on Council reform and offers a good basis \r\nfor all of us to build upon. It is a ref lection of all of the \r\nwork that has been done so far, and it is important that \r\nwe build on it further.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations process \r\nurgently needs to produce tangible results so as to \r\ndemonstrate that there can be progress, that reform is \r\npossible and that the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nremain a suitable platform for achieving such reform. \r\nIf the intergovernmental negotiations are unable to \r\nshow progress, they will become irrelevant. Let me \r\nonce again ask a question that I have often asked from \r\nthis rostrum — are the intergovernmental negotiations \r\na vehicle for reform or merely an instrument for \r\nmaintaining the status quo? Are they capable of \r\ndelivering reform or will they end in gridlock?\r\nThe point I am making is that if the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations are to be taken seriously, they must deliver \r\nresults soon. Failure to reform the Security Council in \r\nthe interest of better ref lecting present-day realities \r\nwill inevitably undermine the trust that people have \r\nin the Security Council and, more broadly, in the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nSingapore has reiterated its consistent and \r\nlong-standing position on Security Council reform \r\nmany times. I echo the sentiment of many others in \r\nstating that the Council must ref lect and exemplify \r\nthe diversity among States Members of the United \r\nNations of today. There must be broader geographical \r\nrepresentation and inclusivity in the Council, \r\nparticularly from underrepresented regions such as \r\nAfrica. That means that both the permanent and the \r\nnon-permanent membership must be expanded. We also \r\nwish to underline the need for small States, particularly \r\nsmall island developing States, to be represented. No \r\nreform process should disadvantage the small States \r\nor the small island developing States. In that regard, \r\nwe welcome the expression of support from groups \r\nand delegations for the representation of small States \r\nand small island developing States in an expanded \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nSingapore would therefore like to make the \r\nfollowing comments on the way forward for the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process this year. First, \r\nwe must recognize and build on the progress that we \r\nhave made in our discussions over the past three years \r\non elements of commonality and issues for further \r\nconsideration. We will rely on the co-Chairs’ wisdom \r\nas to how best to take forward those discussions, based \r\non the work that has already been done. We welcome the \r\nfact that there will be continuity through the continued \r\npresence of one of the co-Chairs. We think that will be \r\nvery helpful.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the Security Council’s \r\nworking methods, we believe that there have \r\nbeen steps in the right direction to improve the \r\nCouncil’s transparency, efficiency and engagement \r\nwith non-members. We welcome the adoption and \r\nimplementation of Security Council presidential note \r\n507 (S/2017/507), and we note the increased regularity \r\nof introductory and wrap-up sessions by Council \r\nPresidents. But we think more can be done to ensure \r\nequity in the distribution of the chairmanships of \r\nsubsidiary bodies, as well as the famous — or should \r\nI say — infamous penholdership system. We welcome \r\nthe more active role played by the 10 elected members \r\nin the Council and we encourage all elected members \r\nto continue to play an active role within the Council.\r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 19/28\r\nFinally, there must be greater accountability and \r\ntransparency in the decision-making processes of the \r\nCouncil, particularly with regard to the role played by its \r\nsanctions committees. I am encouraged by the initiative \r\nlaunched by several Member States and bodies this \r\nyear to create a best practices guide for representatives \r\non the sanctions committees and the experts, aimed \r\nat improving the effectiveness and transparency of \r\nthe Council’s use of sanctions. The regional meeting \r\nreaching out to various groups held by the Security \r\nCouncil Committee established pursuant to resolution \r\n1718 (2006) yesterday is another good example of the \r\nsort of thing that needs to be encouraged. We believe \r\nthat, over time, such initiatives will add to the body \r\nof knowledge and help to foster greater understanding \r\nand participation in the United Nations sanctions \r\nsystem, which is of the utmost importance given the \r\nimpact and consequences that sanctions can have on \r\nall States Members of the United Nations. The Council \r\nshould find ways to continue working with the General \r\nAssembly to take that issue forward.\r\nI assure the co-Chairs of Singapore’s commitment \r\nto and continued support for the important topic of \r\nSecurity Council reform. Singapore is a small country, \r\nand its survival depends on there being a world governed \r\nby a multilateral rules-based system. The success \r\nof the United Nations is critical to small States like \r\nSingapore. As the United Nations organ responsible for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nthe Council also has a special responsibility to be the \r\nguardian of the multilateral rules-based system. We ask \r\nthe members of the Council, especially the permanent \r\nmembers, to ref lect on the role that has been entrusted \r\nto them and the role that they should play with regard to \r\nthe Council’s reform process. They too have a special \r\nresponsibility to lead the reform process. Robust \r\ndebate within the Council must also be accompanied \r\nby a willingness to compromise and the political will to \r\nchange. Otherwise, the Security Council will amount \r\nto little more than a stage for politics and posturing \r\nwithout meaningful impact on the lives of ordinary \r\npeople on the ground.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): First, I would like to acknowledge the \r\noutstanding work of Ambassadors Nusseibeh of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates and Imnadze of Georgia in the \r\narduous task of co-chairing the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform during the \r\nseventy-second session of the General Assembly. To \r\nthem and to the new, recently appointed co-Chairs for \r\nthe next round of negotiations — Ambassadors Lana \r\nNusseibeh of the United Arab Emirates and Christian \r\nBraun of Luxembourg — I would like to express \r\nArgentina’s commitment to continuing to cooperate \r\nconstructively in order to achieve tangible progress on \r\nsuch an important issue.\r\nWhile Argentina associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Italy on behalf of Uniting \r\nfor Consensus, I would like to highlight a few aspects.\r\nArgentina reiterates its commitment to a \r\nnegotiations process governed by the principles of \r\ndemocracy, transparency and the spirit of f lexibility, \r\nand reaffirms its deep commitment to multilateralism \r\nas a means for achieving a successful outcome. In that \r\nconnection, Argentina believes that it is necessary to \r\nattain results democratically on the basis of the broadest \r\npossible consensus. As expressed by Italy on behalf of \r\nthe Uniting for Consensus countries, the proposal that \r\nhas enjoyed the greatest consensus among Member \r\nStates is the increase in non-permanent members. In \r\nthat regard, Argentina continues to be willing to propose \r\nand find innovative and coherent formulas that ensure \r\na more democratic presence, improve the prospects of \r\nrotating non-permanent members, and reformulate the \r\nworking methods so that the Council can truly become \r\nmore transparent, interactive and inclusive.\r\nTherefore, together with Uniting for Consensus, we \r\nare ready to continue working in favour of a viable and \r\nrealistic reform, exploring intermediate and alternative \r\nformulas that, while respecting the equality of States \r\nand an adequate rotation, would allow us to reach the \r\nbroadest possible consensus. In that respect, we believe \r\nthat proposals for Council reform that envisage longer \r\nterms for non-permanent members, their re-election \r\nor a combination of the two would enjoy the general \r\nconsensus that is so critical. Argentina trusts that \r\nall delegations will show the same commitment \r\nto multilateralism through concrete actions and \r\nleadership, according to their individual capacities, in \r\norder to make progress, now that the tenth anniversary \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations is drawing near.\r\nAs indicated by Italy on behalf of Uniting for \r\nConsensus, there is also consensus on the need to \r\nredress the underrepresentation of certain regions, \r\nespecially the African continent. The Uniting for \r\nConsensus proposal addresses that concern and is the \r\nonly compromise proposal presented in recent years \r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n20/28 18-39080\r\nthat seeks, in a balanced and fair manner, to tackle the \r\naspirations expressed by the various groups involved in \r\nthese deliberations.\r\nWith regard to the right of veto, Argentina has \r\nhistorically opposed such a privilege, which we and \r\nothers consider to be a violation of the principle of the \r\nsovereign equality of States. Our country has defended \r\nthat principle since the Organization’s very inception, \r\nand has reiterated it continually since the beginning of \r\nthe negotiations process for Security Council reform.\r\nThe sovereign equality of States can be ensured only \r\nif all Member States have access to a non-permanent \r\nseat on the Security Council, thus avoiding privileges \r\nfor only a few countries. The proposal seeks to promote \r\nregional representation by adjusting the ratios of each \r\nregional group to ensure more equitable representation. \r\nArgentina maintains, however, that the inclusion of new \r\npermanent members will not ensure the participation of \r\ncountries that are not represented on the Council today. \r\nThe only way to achieve that objective is through \r\na system based on elections, where the will of those \r\nrepresented lends legitimacy to their representatives.\r\nThe improvement of the Council’s working methods \r\ncontinues to be of paramount importance for Argentina. \r\nWe have taken every opportunity to encourage the \r\nCouncil to work in an open and transparent manner \r\nand to be accountable for its actions to the entire \r\nOrganization. In that regard, Argentina hopes that \r\nthe principles of democracy and accountability will \r\ncontinue to guide the process during the next round of \r\nnegotiations, encouraging the broadest participation of \r\nMember States.\r\nIn conclusion, Argentina reiterates and reaffirms \r\nits willingness to consider with an open mind any \r\nproposal that respects the principles set by the General \r\nAssembly, and hopes that the next round of negotiations \r\nwill be able to fully address the five dimensions of \r\nSecurity Council reform in order to achieve satisfactory \r\nresults for all parties involved.\r\nMr. Matjila (South Africa): We welcome the \r\nconvening of the timely and relevant debate on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\nmatters related to the Security Council. We appreciate, \r\nMadam President, that you have identified the reform \r\nof the Security Council as one of the key priorities of \r\nyour presidency. I would therefore like to assure you of \r\nmy delegation’s unwavering support in that endeavour \r\nand trust that, through your leadership, considerable \r\nprogress will be made in moving the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process forward.\r\nAllow me also to congratulate the incoming \r\nco-Chairs, Mrs. Lana Nusseibeh and Mr. Christian \r\nBraun, on assuming the important and challenging \r\nrole of facilitating the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nduring the seventy-third session. The incoming \r\nco-Chairs can once again count on my delegation’s full \r\nsupport and cooperation.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representatives of Saint Vincent \r\nand Grenadines on behalf of the L.69 group and \r\nof Sierra Leone on behalf of the Group of African \r\nStates, respectively. We wish to make the following \r\nadditional remarks.\r\nThis year marks 53 years since the first and \r\nonly expansion of the Security Council. That limited \r\nexpansion led to an increase in the non-permanent \r\nmembership category only, while the vast majority \r\nof our Organization’s members remained excluded \r\nfrom the Council’s permanent membership category. \r\nIt has been 26 years since the adoption of resolution \r\n47/62, which initiated the General Assembly process \r\nfor dealing with the reform of the Security Council \r\nin the comprehensive manner that we had set out to \r\nundertake. This year marks exactly one decade since \r\nthe start of the intergovernmental negotiations process \r\nand 13 years since the 2005 World Summit Outcome, \r\nwhich unanimously agreed on the early reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. It is with deep regret that, despite \r\nthose efforts, the reform process of the Security \r\nCouncil has not produced any results.\r\nSouth Africa urges all Member States to redouble \r\ntheir efforts and to exercise the necessary political \r\nwill in order to reinvigorate the negotiations with the \r\nmandated aim of achieving the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil in an inclusive manner. In that regard, South \r\nAfrica firmly believes that continued, direct, enhanced \r\nand constructive engagement by all Member States \r\nis required.\r\nIn that context, we would like to propose the \r\nfollowing. First, we join other Member States in \r\ncalling for the start of text-based negotiations and \r\nthe establishment of a road map with clear and \r\nimplementable time frames for the immediate \r\nnormalization of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess. It is important to underscore the fact that 164 \r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 21/28\r\nout of the 193 countries of the United Nations want the \r\nimmediate commencement of text-based negotiations. \r\nThat overwhelming number represents more than 80 per \r\ncent of the Organization’s membership and comprises \r\nall the regions of the United Nations, the small island \r\ndeveloping States and some of the members of the \r\npermanent five. That vital point cannot be ignored.\r\nSecondly, the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess need not be reinvented. The current revised \r\ndocument on the negotiations, produced during the \r\nseventy-second session of the General Assembly, is \r\na positive step on which we could build. In our view, \r\nthe revised document is not definitive but it is a step \r\ncloser towards the next logical step of give-and-take \r\nnegotiations. South Africa would welcome the accurate \r\ninclusion of the Ezulwini Consensus in the revised \r\ndocument, in line with the overwhelming support that \r\nthe Common African Position has received thus far. \r\nWe also strongly advocate for the expansion of both \r\nthe permanent and the non-permanent membership \r\ncategories in order to ensure that all the regions are \r\nrepresented on the Council on an equitable basis.\r\nThirdly, ending this year’s intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations in June, as in the two previous sessions, \r\nwould not be an effective use of time and would not \r\nprovide an adequate opportunity for full discussion. It \r\nwould also create the impression that there is no urgency \r\nto this very important and long-standing process. \r\nThe vast majority of our Organization’s membership \r\ncontinues to hold the view that reform of the Council \r\nis long overdue.\r\nMy delegation therefore wishes to emphasize \r\nand reiterate its urgent call for the speedy reform of \r\nthe Security Council. The world and the work of the \r\nCouncil have changed markedly over the past 73 years, \r\nwith an ever-increasing focus on developments on the \r\nAfrican continent. It is therefore our steadfast belief \r\nthat it remains an anomaly that the more than 1 billion \r\npeople on our continent remain without a voice in the \r\npermanent membership category of the Council, a \r\ncentral and global organ of the United Nations. That \r\ncannot be justified. The prolonged present composition \r\nof that organ since the inception of this debate years ago \r\nwill continue to undermine the legitimacy, credibility \r\nand high standing that we accord it, should we fail to \r\nurgently implement the necessary and required reforms.\r\nThe current stalemate in the Council on many of \r\nthe key issues on its agenda and the glaring failure \r\nof the Council to carry out its mandate, pursuant to \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security can be largely \r\nattributed to its current configuration. It is for that \r\nreason that South Africa calls for urgent practical steps \r\nto be taken during the current seventy-third session.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm my \r\ndelegation’s commitment to working with you, Madam \r\nPresident, and other Member States to ensure that \r\nthis session of the intergovernmental negotiations is a \r\nsuccess. We reiterate our call for this session to produce \r\na fair and successful outcome in order to restore the \r\ncredibility and legitimacy of the Council as one of the \r\ncritical organs of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Bessho (Japan): I thank you, Madam President, \r\nfor convening this important meeting.\r\nJapan fully aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of India, on behalf of the Group of Four. \r\nPlease allow me, however, to make a few remarks in my \r\nnational capacity.\r\nThis year marks 10 years since we began the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. Yet, in that time, we \r\nhave seen little progress. It is essential for the Security \r\nCouncil’s credibility that its composition ref lect the \r\nrealities of the twenty-first century. As Prime Minister \r\nAbe said during the general debate in September,\r\n“in the light of the lack of progress in reforming the \r\nSecurity Council, the significance of the United \r\nNations in the twenty-first-century world is already \r\nbeing severely questioned” (A/73/PV.7, p.43).\r\nI wish to focus on four key elements in my \r\nremarks today.\r\nFirst, Japan notes with satisfaction that the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly has highlighted the \r\nrevitalization of the United Nations as a core item on \r\nher agenda, which, we understand, includes Security \r\nCouncil reform. We welcome the President’s emphasis \r\non that issue, and ask her to exercise her leadership \r\nin guiding us forward in the coming year. We look \r\nforward to cooperating closely with the co-Chairs, \r\nwhom the President has just named to oversee the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during this session.\r\nSecondly, we strongly request the long-overdue \r\ncommencement of text-based negotiations to be agreed \r\nto immediately. That is a natural next step to our work \r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n22/28 18-39080\r\nover the past decade. Negotiating based on a text is the \r\nway we take action here at the United Nations, and we \r\nare concerned that, after a decade of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, we do not even have a text on which to \r\nbase our negotiations, which impairs our ability to \r\nproceed. More than 160 countries have expressed \r\nsupport for text-based negotiations, and we need to \r\ntake action accordingly.\r\nThirdly, we believe that we should continue work \r\non the document that we were drafting at the end of the \r\nprevious session. We also reaffirm our support for the \r\nattribution of views in the text. That will enable us to \r\nsee clearly who made what proposal and, in particular, \r\nwill ensure an accurate and appropriate ref lection of \r\nthe Common African Position in the negotiations. For \r\nour part, we have long held that the Council should be \r\nexpanded in both the permanent and the non-permanent \r\ncategories, a view shared by a broad majority of the \r\nmembership. A text that clearly ref lects the positions \r\nof all Member States will allow us to engage in the \r\ngive-and-take discussions that will be necessary in \r\norder to reach an agreement.\r\nFinally, we believe that the current \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process should be \r\nreviewed. If we need consensus for decision-making, \r\nit gives a de facto veto over the process to just a few \r\ncountries, which we believe does not represent the will \r\nof the great majority.\r\nThis is an inflection point for Security Council \r\nreform. If we fail to make significant headway in the \r\ncoming session, I fear that the legitimacy and viability \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations process itself \r\nwill come into question. It is urgent that this year’s \r\nsession be a productive one.\r\nIn 2020, we will celebrate the seventy-fifth \r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations. It is \r\nour responsibility as Member States to make concrete \r\nprogress on Security Council reform in time for that \r\nmilestone. Only through reform can we ensure that the \r\nCouncil will maintain the legitimacy it needs in order \r\nto play its vital role as we move forward.\r\nLastly, I have to add that it is regrettable that a \r\ngroundless statement was made about Japan in this Hall \r\njust a few minutes ago. That statement is irrelevant to \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nMr. Fernández de Soto Valderrama (Colombia) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): Colombia associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by Ambassador Maria Angela Zappia, \r\nPermanent Representative of Italy, on behalf of the \r\nUniting for Consensus group, of which we are a part.\r\nI would like to thank you, Madam President, for \r\nthis opportunity to allow the membership to conduct a \r\nfrank dialogue on the now critical enlargement of the \r\nSecurity Council, an issue that impacts the functioning, \r\nrepresentativeness and credibility of the United \r\nNations. It must be remembered that the philosophy \r\nthat drives our Organization has been that the collective \r\ndecision-making process should be oriented towards \r\nthe greatest possible majority, not towards the granting \r\nof privileges to a few members.\r\nThat is why we believe that the granting of new \r\npermanent seats with veto rights is not the way to lend a \r\nmore democratic and inclusive character to the Security \r\nCouncil. That is why Colombia’s historic position has \r\nalways been guided by the democratic principles of \r\ntransparency and inclusivity, as stated by Ambassador \r\nZappia. That is also why Colombia maintains that a \r\ndiscussion on truly democratic and inclusive reforms \r\nrequires the broadest possible consensus, if it is to \r\nbe successful. That is why the United for Consensus \r\ngroup has always proposed an openness to explore \r\npoints of convergence with the entire membership, \r\nwhich we can reach only by showing f lexibility on an \r\nongoing basis.\r\nCertainly, I have no doubt that the question of the \r\nveto is one of the main elements that has prevented \r\nprogress in the intergovernmental negotiations process \r\nover the years. On that issue, my country has held its \r\nprincipled position since 1945, firmly rooted in the \r\nsovereign equality of States, and the veto goes against \r\nthat fundamental pillar.\r\nIn that regard, our proposal, the proposal of the \r\nUnited for Consensus group, seeks to ensure that the \r\nCouncil is representative in a way that reinforces its \r\neffectiveness. We believe that a regional rotation \r\nbased on elections is a key element in achieving that \r\nobjective. In that way, the regional groups that are \r\nclearly underrepresented will have access to the \r\nCouncil. Regions such as mine, Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, small island developing States, the many \r\ncountries in the Group of Eastern European States, \r\nArab countries and especially Africa must have new \r\nseats, which would allow them to see their interests \r\ndirectly represented in the Council.\r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 23/28\r\nThe enlargement of the Security \r\nCouncil is intended to make it more \r\nrepresentative — that is, a body that is capable of acting \r\non behalf of the international community in line with the \r\nguiding principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nIt could be argued that, from a purely numerical \r\nperspective, over the years the Council has \r\nbecome less representative of the United Nations \r\ngeneral membership.\r\nA greater possibility for Member States to sit \r\nregularly in the Council will also be required. The best \r\nway to achieve that goal is through an increase in the \r\nnumber of elected seats, which is a measure that would \r\nalso make the Security Council more responsible and \r\nmore accountable to the entire Organization. Otherwise, \r\nwe would be making the mistake of creating a more \r\nexclusive Council, rather than the more inclusive one \r\nwe want, in the midst of an international situation that \r\ncalls on all States to respond to the universal ideals of \r\nsustainable peace and security and where the actors in \r\nthe Council are regularly accountable to all Members.\r\nMy country, myself included, can be counted on \r\nto make progress in the work to achieve that Council.\r\nMr. Hunter (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is pleased to continue this discussion \r\non Security Council reform, and we look forward \r\nto coordinating closely on issues within the group \r\nhandling the intergovernmental negotiations during the \r\nseventy-third session.\r\nWe also thank the outgoing leadership, \r\nAmbassador Nusseibeh and Ambassador Imnadze, \r\nfor their stewardship. Their efforts have resulted in \r\none of the core documents of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations from the seventy-second session of \r\nthe General Assembly — the paper on the revised \r\nelements of commonality and issues for further \r\nconsideration — which has crystallized the areas \r\nrequiring a greater focus in the coming year. The input \r\nfrom Member States was also critical to determining \r\nhow the intergovernmental negotiations should best \r\napproach its work in the year ahead.\r\nIn this coming session, we look forward to \r\naddressing the topic, as outlined by our co-Chairs, \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and other matters \r\nrelated to the Security Council. We have been very clear \r\nthat the United States approaches those negotiations \r\nwith four core objectives in mind.\r\nFirst, we support a modest expansion of the \r\nCouncil in both the permanent and the non-permanent \r\ncategories. Consideration of any new permanent \r\nmembership must take into account the ability \r\nand willingness of candidates to contribute to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. It \r\nmust also take into account their willingness to exercise \r\nthe responsibilities that come with Security Council \r\nmembership. That includes an enhanced financial \r\nresponsibility as well.\r\nSecondly, the United States opposes any change to \r\nthe veto. Any expansion or alteration of the veto is a red \r\nline for the United States.\r\nThirdly, the United States remains open to any form \r\nof negotiation within the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nframework — whether text-based or otherwise — as \r\nlong as that format allows for broad consensus. Wide \r\nagreement across the intergovernmental negotiations is \r\nthe only way that reform will ultimately succeed.\r\nFinally, we seek an effective and efficient Security \r\nCouncil. The United States will support only those \r\nreforms that improve the effectiveness and efficiency \r\nof the Council and advance the Council’s core mandate \r\nof addressing challenges to international peace and \r\nsecurity. We remain committed to a process that \r\nachieves the right reforms, rather than to a fixed \r\ntimeline for those reforms.\r\nThe United States remains committed to a \r\ncomprehensive solution that can secure the broadest \r\nsupport of Member States. A modernized Council \r\nshould be not only representative of the twenty-\r\nfirst century but also capable of responding to new \r\nchallenges and be well-positioned to fulfil its mandate \r\nwith regard to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. In combination with other appropriate \r\nSecurity Council reforms, a thoughtfully considered \r\nenlargement of the Council could help to maintain its \r\neffectiveness in the long run.\r\nMr. Ma Zhaoxu (China) (spoke in Chinese): I thank \r\nyou, Madam President, for convening today’s meeting. \r\nChina welcomes the President’s appointment of \r\nAmbassador Lana Nusseibeh, Permanent Representative \r\nof the United Arab Emirates, and Ambassador Christian \r\nBraun, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We expect that the co-Chairs \r\nwill fulfil their responsibilities in line with their \r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n24/28 18-39080\r\nmandate. China will actively support the co-Chairs in \r\nthe conduct of their work.\r\nDuring the negotiations at the seventy-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly, Member States had \r\ncandid, patient and in-depth discussions on all five \r\nclusters of issues concerning Security Council reform, \r\nas well as their inherent interconnectedness. Better \r\nmutual understanding, which is necessary for reaching \r\nthe broadest possible consensus, has been achieved. \r\nChina appreciates that fact and is grateful to the \r\nprevious co-Chairs, the Permanent Representatives of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates and Georgia, for their efforts.\r\nSecurity Council reform involves the vital interests \r\nof all Member States and the long-term development of \r\nthe United Nations. It bears on the future of the global \r\ncollective security system and is an important part of \r\nthe reform of the global governance system. China has \r\nalways supported a reasonable and necessary reform of \r\nthe Council. It is our consistent view that priority should \r\nbe given to increasing the representation and voice of \r\ndeveloping countries, especially African countries.\r\nReform should enable more Member States, \r\nparticularly small and medium-sized countries, \r\nwhich account for the majority of the United Nations \r\nmembership, to be more involved in the decision-making \r\nprocess of the Council and to play a greater role. The \r\nonly viable way to achieve reform is to pursue decision \r\n62/557 and the consensus of Member States, while \r\nseeking the most widely acceptable package that offers \r\na solution to the five clusters of issues through extensive \r\nand democratic consultations within the membership-\r\ndriven intergovernmental negotiations process.\r\nRather than further the process of reform, \r\nattempts to set an artificial timeline aimed at rushing \r\nthrough insufficiently developed reform proposals \r\nor to arbitrarily launch text-based negotiations when \r\nthe conditions are not ripe would only undermine \r\nunity, while failing to substantially address the \r\nunderrepresentation of developing countries in the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations process is an \r\nimportant platform for Member States to exchange \r\nviews and reach greater mutual understanding on \r\nSecurity Council reform. It is a credible, transparent \r\nand inclusive communication channel. At a time when \r\nserious divergences remain on the issue of reform, \r\nMember States should continue a frank, thorough \r\nand in-depth exchange of views in order to better \r\nunderstand each other’s positions. China expects the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to remain a Member \r\nState-driven process aimed at seeking the broadest \r\npossible consensus that meets the common interests \r\nof all. China will work with all the other parties \r\nand continue to play a positive and constructive role \r\ntowards that end.\r\nMr. Al-Khalifa (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to thank you, Madam President, for convening \r\nthis important meeting. We reiterate our support to \r\nthe co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess on Security Council reform.\r\nThe State of Qatar aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade on behalf of the Group of Arab States.\r\nThe increasing challenges that face the international \r\ncommunity in the area of international peace and \r\nsecurity compel Member States to forge ahead with \r\nnegotiations on comprehensive and genuine reforms \r\nof the Security Council aimed at rendering it more \r\ncapable of dealing with such challenges. Although the \r\nnegotiations process on reforming the Security Council \r\nstarted many years ago and despite the complexity of \r\nthe issues under discussion, the progress achieved so \r\nfar and the elements of commonality that have been \r\nidentified, thanks to the determination of all States, \r\ncall on us to intensify our efforts and demonstrate \r\nmore f lexibility in the reform process so as to render \r\nthe United Nations stronger and more effective.\r\nSecurity Council reform remains a crucial issue \r\nfor the credibility of the United Nations with regard \r\nto its ability to fulfil its mandate, as enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, and to become more \r\ntransparent, representative and effective. In that \r\nregard, a successful reform process requires adherence \r\nto the terms of reference of that process, in particular \r\nthe interrelation of all the principal negotiated issues \r\nand the common elements among them in accordance \r\nwith decision 62/557, which was adopted by consensus. \r\nAny attempt, therefore, to reform the Security Council \r\nwill not be successful if it focuses only on one aspect \r\nand ignores the others.\r\nAgainst that perspective, the State of Qatar \r\nsupports a comprehensive reform that renders the \r\nSecurity Council more inclusive, democratic and \r\nrepresentative of all regions. The reform must ref lect \r\nthe geopolitical realities that exist today, an aspect that \r\nhas been widely stressed during the negotiation process, \r\nincluding granting small and medium-sized countries \r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 25/28\r\nmore opportunities to serve in an enlarged Council. \r\nSuch reforms would strengthen the accountability, \r\ntransparency, legitimacy and effectiveness of \r\nthe Council.\r\nThe State of Qatar reiterates that any reform \r\nof the Security Council must go hand in hand with \r\nimprovements in the working methods of the Council \r\nand its decision-making process. Interaction and \r\ndialogue with non-Council members through informal \r\ninteractive meetings would therefore contribute to \r\nenhancing the effectiveness and transparency of \r\nthe Council.\r\nThe State of Qatar reaffirms that the question of \r\nthe veto power is a crucial issue in the Council reform \r\nprocess. Experience has shown that restricting the use \r\nof the veto power or refraining from using it in cases \r\nof atrocity crimes, such as war crimes, genocide and \r\nethnic cleansing, helps to stop those crimes. We also \r\nunderscore the important role played by the General \r\nAssembly in issues related to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, in accordance with \r\nArticle 11 of the Charter, including the submission of \r\nrecommendations to the Council. The complementary \r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly is therefore vital and of paramount \r\nimportance in efforts to strike a balance in the work of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nConsistent with that approach, which is enshrined \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations, the desired aims \r\nof the reform require a commitment to the principles \r\nand purposes of the Charter in the areas of peace, \r\nsecurity, development and human rights. Any violation \r\nof the Charter and international law weakens the role \r\nof the United Nations, undermines the credibility of \r\nits bodies and adversely affects international efforts \r\nto enhance the mechanisms available to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security. Accordingly, threats \r\nto the sovereignty of countries, military interventions \r\nand the use of force against countries represent a \r\nchallenge to the mandate of the Security Council and \r\nthe international community, as well as a f lagrant \r\nviolation of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\ninternational law and General Assembly and Security \r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nIn conclusion, the State of Qatar remains committed \r\nto the mechanisms of international cooperation. We \r\nwill participate positively in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the reform of the Security Council with \r\nthe aim of making it more efficient and accountable, \r\nwhile rendering it better able to take timely decisions \r\naimed at maintaining international peace and security.\r\nMrs. Rodríguez Camejo (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Cuban delegation takes this opportunity to pay \r\ntribute to the work carried out by the Ambassadors of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates and Georgia, who served as \r\nthe co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess on Security Council reform during the seventy-\r\nsecond session. We congratulate the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of the United Arab Emirates and \r\nLuxembourg for taking on that responsibility during \r\nthe current session.\r\nDuring the first half of the year, a total of five \r\nconsultations were held within that process, which \r\nconcluded with the adoption, by consensus, of the \r\noral decision of the President of the General Assembly \r\nrenewing the mandate of the process so as to continue \r\nthose negotiations at the seventy-third session. During \r\nthe consultations, the deep divergences among \r\ndelegations were evident, not only on issues related \r\nto the five thematic clusters but also on the course of \r\naction around the negotiations.\r\nIn that context, Cuba reiterates that only through \r\ndebate and negotiations, within the established time and \r\nframeworks, will it be possible to define a route towards \r\na consensus on that reform. To that end, it is essential \r\nto analyse comprehensively, and not separately, the \r\nfive thematic clusters on Council reform, namely, the \r\ncategories of membership, regional representation, the \r\nsize of an enlarged Security Council and its working \r\nmethods, the question of the veto, and the relationship \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly.\r\nThe update of the paper on the elements of \r\ncommonality and issues for further consideration \r\nclearly shows that numerous consultations are still \r\nrequired in order to narrow the gaps between the \r\nvarious positions. We reaffirm the fundamental role \r\nof the General Assembly in the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. Accordingly, all proposals of Member States \r\nmust be heard, analysed and included in the basic \r\ndocument of the process.\r\nThis meeting has demonstrated the importance \r\nof a genuine reform of the Security Council that \r\nwould transform it into an effective, transparent and \r\nrepresentative body. An essential element of Security \r\nCouncil reform is the modification of its working \r\nmethods. Although documents have been adopted with \r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n26/28 18-39080\r\nthe aim of improving those methods, including the note \r\nby the President of the Security Council (S/2010/507), \r\ngreater efforts are still required in the search for \r\neffective formulas that ensure the genuine participation \r\nof Member States in the work and decision-making of \r\nthe Council.\r\nMeasures that do not take into account the views of \r\nall members of that body or, at times, even those of all \r\nits permanent members have often been adopted. The \r\nlack of transparency and the exclusionary practices \r\nare constant traits of the Council’s working dynamics. \r\nThe Security Council must adjust its functions to \r\nthe mandate established by the Charter of the United \r\nNations and respect the role, authority and functions of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nWe share the concerns about the growing tendency \r\nof the Security Council to consider issues and assume \r\nfunctions outside its competence, increasingly usurping \r\nthe role assigned by the Charter to the other organs of \r\nthe United Nations, particularly the General Assembly. \r\nThat trend must cease immediately. Too frequently and \r\noften prematurely, the Council has been addressing \r\nissues that do not necessarily pose an immediate threat \r\nto international peace and security, even invoking \r\nChapter VII of the Charter for that purpose.\r\nIn accordance with the mandate assigned to it by \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, the Security Council \r\nshould specifically focus its attention on addressing the \r\nmost urgent problems that threaten international peace \r\nand security. As set out in the Charter, Chapter VII \r\nshould be invoked only as a last resort. The application \r\nof double standards and political manipulation in the \r\nanalysis of certain issues under the consideration of \r\nthe Council also pose a concern that is shared by many \r\ndelegations. In accordance with Article 24 of the Charter, \r\nMember States recognize that the Security Council acts \r\non their behalf in carrying out its functions. The work \r\nof the Council is therefore the collective responsibility \r\nof the States Members of the United Nations, to which \r\ntrue participation in the decision-making in the work of \r\nthat body must be ensured.\r\nWe object to national agendas and interests being \r\nimposed as issues for the Council’s attention under the \r\nfalse pretext that there exists a threat to international \r\npeace and security. It is necessary to increase the number \r\nof public meetings of the Council. Closed meetings and \r\ninformal consultations should be the exception and not \r\nthe rule. In order to increase the transparency and the \r\nlevel of accountability, a final text that contains the \r\ndefinitive rules of procedure of the Security Council \r\nshould be adopted. It is inconceivable that the Council’s \r\nrules have remained provisional for more than 70 years. \r\nThe annual reports that the Council is obliged to submit \r\nto the General Assembly should be genuinely analytical \r\nand must adequately evaluate performance.\r\nThe question of the veto is intrinsically linked \r\nto the working methods of the Council, particularly \r\nthe decision-making mechanism. The veto is an \r\nanachronistic and undemocratic privilege that must \r\nbe eliminated. Regarding the membership of the \r\nCouncil, Cuba reiterates that it supports the expansion \r\nof that body in the categories of both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent membership. The main objective of the \r\nexpansion of the Security Council should be to rectify \r\nthe underrepresentation of developing countries. \r\nThe main increase in membership should therefore \r\ncorrespond to an increase in the number of developing \r\ncountries from Africa, Asia and Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean.\r\nIf the category of permanent membership is not \r\nexpanded and only the number of non-permanent seats \r\nis increased, the existing gap between permanent and \r\nnon-permanent membership will be further widened, \r\nincreasing the disproportionate representation of \r\ndeveloped and developing countries on the Council. \r\nAs a consequence, the Council would become even \r\nless representative and, thereby, less legitimate \r\nand effective.\r\nLastly, I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nour aspiration for a representative, democratic, \r\ntransparent and efficient Security Council, in which \r\nthe views of all States Members of the Organization \r\nare taken into account, in accordance with the mandate \r\nof the Charter and the diverse realities of the current \r\nworld. For that purpose, the Organization can count on \r\nCuba’s full support.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): At the outset, allow me to \r\ncongratulate the Permanent Representatives of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates and Luxembourg, respectively, on \r\ntheir appointment as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the Ambassador of Italy on behalf of the \r\nUniting for Consensus group.\r\n20/11/2018 A/73/PV.36\r\n18-39080 27/28\r\nIn your inaugural address, Madam President, to \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-third session, you \r\ninvoked the Andean principle of minga — a joining of \r\nranks by the international community — to address \r\nthe complex and interconnected challenges that we \r\nall confront today (see A/73/PV.6). We heard an \r\nequally impassioned call for collective action by world \r\nleaders during the high-level general debate of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThat firm commitment to international cooperation \r\nbased on mutual respect and shared benefit is the \r\nvery quintessence of multilateralism, an outlook that \r\nprizes a spirit of f lexibility and compromise to achieve \r\nthe common good and that opposes unilateralist \r\napproaches, which seek to achieve narrow, self-\r\nserving interests. As the foundation of the rules-based \r\ninternational order, it is imperative that the United \r\nNations remain fully imbued with those ideals and \r\ncontinue to be an Organization that does not merely act \r\non behalf of Member States but rather acts for them; \r\none that not only embraces the spirit of our times, but \r\nalso epitomizes those values.\r\nThe contemporary reality is a democratic reality. \r\nA credible United Nations is therefore a representative \r\nUnited Nations, ref lecting the interests and views \r\nof all Member States — small, medium and large. \r\nThat is also a point of departure for a comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council and serves as a guiding \r\nprinciple for my country and the Uniting for Consensus \r\ngroup in seeking a more democratic, representative, \r\naccountable, transparent and effective Council. For \r\nus, the reform process is therefore not an end in itself; \r\nit is also a true expression of our commitment to the \r\nfundamentals of multilateralism.\r\nAs the intergovernmental negotiations process \r\nmarks 10 years since its establishment, it would be \r\nappropriate to ref lect on the progress achieved so far in \r\nrelation to the goals that we have set ourselves, namely, \r\na democratic and representative Council that is in line \r\nwith the ever-changing and dynamic global landscape \r\nsurrounding it. Evidently, while there is consensus on \r\nexpanding the non-permanent category, fundamental \r\nquestions and divisions persist on the very need for \r\nor desirability of expanding the permanent category. \r\nThe reasons for that are more than apparent. New \r\npermanency is seen as nothing but an imitation of \r\nold permanency, for it seeks to address the inherent \r\ndysfunctions of the Council, stemming from permanent \r\nmembership and the veto, by reinforcing them instead \r\nof reforming them.\r\nIt also undermines the democratic and representative \r\nnature of the reform process, for it denies the larger \r\nmembership its democratic right to hold Council \r\nmembers to account in an environment in which nearly \r\none third of the membership has never served on the \r\nCouncil. Furthermore, an expansion in the permanent \r\ncategory at the cost of non-permanent members would \r\nalso significantly diminish prospects for many smaller \r\nStates, in particular small island developing States, \r\nto ever be elected to the Council. Those that base \r\ntheir claims for permanent seats on the imperative of \r\naddressing contemporary realities in fact offer fixed \r\nsolutions to transient situations. The question of the veto \r\nis another by-product of permanence. If the Council \r\ncannot reconcile the interests of its five permanent \r\nmembers, how will it cope with the interests of a larger \r\npermanent membership and still be effective?\r\nIf progress is indeed to be made, we must debunk \r\nthe fallacy that expansion in the permanent category \r\nis intrinsic to the reform of the Security Council. \r\nThe work and effectiveness of the Council are not a \r\nfunction of its composition, much less of its permanent \r\nmembers. As the historical record shows, it is the \r\nnon-permanent members that have traditionally \r\nchampioned greater inclusiveness and transparency \r\nin the work of the Council, especially within the \r\nframework of its provisional rules of procedure. It is \r\nalso in the non-permanent category that the Council’s \r\nfailure to be representative can be addressed.\r\nA solution that offers more seats to all the regions \r\nprovides a better opportunity for all Member States, \r\nincluding cross-regional and subregional groups, \r\nto serve on the Council. That is why the Uniting for \r\nConsensus (UFC) group is proposing a significant \r\nincrease in the number of elected seats for all regional \r\ngroupings, especially for Africa. It also puts into \r\nperspective our firm opposition to the creation of new \r\npermanent seats. Fresh chains of inherited privilege \r\nwould invariably threaten, not strengthen, norms \r\nof democracy, accountability and transparency in \r\nthe Council.\r\nWhat is required now to move the reform process \r\nforward is to identify our convergences and build on \r\nsuch common ground. Finding that common ground \r\nrequires f lexibility and compromise on the part of all \r\nsides. There are, after all, no procedural quick fixes \r\nA/73/PV.36 20/11/2018\r\n28/28 18-39080\r\nthat can substitute for or sidestep the need to forge a \r\nreal consensus. Unless we are willing to go that extra \r\nmile, progress will remain elusive. The UFC not only \r\nhas lived by those ideals but will continue to be guided \r\nby them in its engagement with efforts to achieve a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council, one that \r\ntakes into account the positions of all Member States. \r\nAnything less would be regression, not reform. After all, \r\nthe burden of a large, unwieldy and inefficient Council \r\nconfounded by an enlarged clique is an outcome that \r\nthe international community neither seeks nor would \r\nbe prepared to support.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
