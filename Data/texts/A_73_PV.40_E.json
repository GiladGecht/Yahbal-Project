In order to avoid \r\nsuch a misunderstanding, we would like to clarify our \r\nunderstanding of paragraph 2. In particular, we want \r\nto clarify that the term “in this context” with respect \r\nto information-sharing refers broadly to counter-\r\nterrorism efforts. We stress that information-sharing \r\nfor terrorist-screening purposes, which increases the \r\nchances of positive identification of terrorists and their \r\naffiliates, as well as making full use of INTERPOL \r\ncapabilities in this regard, should not be limited solely \r\nto strengthening international efforts aimed at ensuring \r\nthat refugee status is not abused by terrorists, but rather \r\nshould be used in all screening of travellers.\r\nWe also note our understanding that refugee status \r\nis not abused when it is granted in accordance with \r\nStates obligations under international law. We hope that \r\nthese clarifications are helpful to other Member States \r\nin consideration of resolution 73/11. \r\nFurthermore, we want to clarify our support for \r\nthe issuance of INTERPOL notices. These notices \r\nshould adhere to law-enforcement and international \r\nhuman rights standards, and we denounce all efforts by \r\nMember States to use these measures to target religious \r\nand political dissidents, including China’s misuse of \r\nINTERPOL notices to target Uighurs.\r\nFinally, we want to reiterate our recognition of \r\nINTERPOL as an apolitical international organization \r\nthat respects the sovereignty of Member States, but \r\nstress the importance of the organization choosing \r\nindividuals for positions of responsibility from \r\ncountries that demonstrate a clear commitment to \r\ntransparency and the rule of law. We remain concerned \r\nabout the disappearance and detention of Meng \r\nHongwei and its implications for a key international \r\nlaw-enforcement agency. Going forward, we urge \r\nMember States to continue to elect and support leaders \r\nin key positions within the organization who will \r\npromote, not undermine, the values and practices that \r\nmake INTERPOL such a vital international body.\r\nMr. Kashaev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We make this statement in explanation of \r\nposition after the adoption of resolution 73/15, entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nCouncil of Europe” (see A/73/PV.39).\r\nThe Russian Federation supports resolution 73/15 \r\nand, in general, is in favour of developing cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe. \r\nWe believe that the resolution will give new impetus \r\nto cooperation between the two organizations on a \r\nwide range of matters. One aim of this cooperation \r\nis preventing violence against women, as declared in \r\nthe Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention. Russia \r\nstands ready to continue to develop cooperation with \r\nthe United Nations and the Council of Europe on \r\nthis important matter. At the same time, the Istanbul \r\nConvention itself contains provisions that run counter \r\n26/11/2018 A/73/PV.40\r\n18-40102 3/5\r\nto Russian legislation, Russia’s family-policy concept \r\ndocument, and principled approaches to the protection \r\nand promotion of traditional family values.\r\nMoreover, with respect to the Council of Europe’s \r\nplatform for the protection of journalists, we note that \r\nit was created in the absence of consensus and reflects \r\nthe opinion of a narrow group of non-governmental \r\norganizations. The platform itself is not a mechanism \r\nfor monitoring treaty obligations in the framework \r\nof the Council of Europe. Therefore, we believe it \r\npremature to refer to the experience of the functioning \r\nof the structure as positive.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of position.\r\nThe representative of the Syrian Arab Republic has \r\nasked to speak in exercise of the right of reply. I remind \r\nhim that statements in the exercise of the right of reply \r\nare limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and \r\nto five minutes for the second intervention and should \r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Al-Arsan (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My country’s delegation would like to exercise \r\nits right of reply to address the misconceptions and \r\nunfounded accusations made by the observer of the \r\nLeague of Arab States at this morning’s plenary under \r\nagenda item 128 (d), entitled “Cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States” (see \r\nA/73/PV.39).\r\nAt the outset, my delegation states that it will never \r\nstoop to the level of the Arab League observer, who \r\nwas aggressive and unprofessional when he spoke about \r\nSyria, one of the founding members of the League. \r\nSyria will always be in favour of Arab cooperation. \r\nIn that context, we officially underscore that, during \r\ntoday’s afternoon break, we contacted a large number \r\nof representatives of Arab States, who categorically \r\nconfirmed to us that the observer’s attacks and \r\nunfounded accusations against the Government of the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic were not part of the original \r\nstatement, which was supposed to reflect the position \r\nof the Arab League on the item under discussion. They \r\nassured us that the Arab League observer had gone \r\nbeyond the bounds of his mandate, thereby confirming \r\nour assertion this morning that the Governments of one \r\nor two States members of that regional organization \r\nhave hijacked and monopolized the decisions and \r\npositions of the Arab League.\r\nI would like now to address the Charter of the \r\nLeague of Arab States, which is the organization’s \r\nfounding law, and the minutes of its official meetings. \r\nThe observer of the Arab League, who is a diplomat \r\nand a former professional ambassador, claimed \r\nbefore the Assembly this morning that the decision to \r\nsuspend Syria’s membership in the League was legal \r\nand unanimous. I call on that professional diplomat to \r\nreview the minutes of the 12 November 2011 meeting \r\nof the Foreign Ministers of the League. According \r\nto the record of that meeting, three member States \r\nexpressed their opposition and reservations with regard \r\nto the decision to suspend Syria’s membership of the \r\nLeague. Furthermore, that professional diplomat stated \r\nthat the decision to suspend Syria’s membership in the \r\nLeague was legal even though he is fully aware that \r\nthe League’s Charter explicitly states that a member \r\ncan be suspended only at a summit meeting and by the \r\nunanimous decision of all member States. I do not wish \r\nto dwell on the details, and we do not have a problem \r\nwith the League as an organization, but we will never \r\nremain silent when someone attempts to misrepresent \r\nor distort the truth.\r\nI would ask the observer and the members of the \r\nAssembly to take a look at the record of the meeting \r\nwhich I have referred to so that they may verify the truth \r\nof what I am saying. On 12 November 2011, the Chair \r\nof the Arab League Council, who was then the Prime \r\nMinister of Qatar, submitted a draft decision to suspend \r\nSyria’s membership. The Permanent Representative of \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic asked the Secretary-General \r\nof the League to let the Council members read the \r\nadvisory opinion issued by the organization’s Office \r\nof Legal Affairs on the question of suspension of \r\nmembership, which explicitly stated that the decision \r\nto suspend a League member is similar to a decision to \r\nexpel a League member. Such a decision should be taken \r\nby member States at a summit meeting and adopted \r\nunanimously. As a founding member of the League of \r\nArab States, we respect the stature and history of the \r\norganization. For that reason, I will not delve into the \r\npressures to which the Secretary-General of the League \r\nwas subjected in order to keep that advisory opinion \r\nfrom being made public to the member States.\r\nThe Arab League observer told the Assembly today \r\nthat the League did not impose any unilateral coercive \r\neconomic measures against the Syrian people. I believe \r\nthat the untruth of that statement will be ascertained \r\nby reference to decision No. 7442, adopted by the Arab \r\nA/73/PV.40 26/11/2018\r\n4/5 18-40102\r\nLeague in November 2011, which imposed a number \r\nof unilateral coercive economic measures against \r\nSyria, including the suspension of transactions with the \r\nCentral Bank of Syria; the suspension of governmental \r\ntrade exchanges with the Syrian Government; the \r\nfreezing of Syrian Government financial assets; the \r\nsuspension of financial transactions with the Syrian \r\nGovernment; the suspension of all transactions with \r\nthe Commercial Bank of Syria; the suspension of all \r\nfunding by Arab central banks to trade exchanges \r\ninvolving the Commercial Bank of Syria; a request to \r\nArab central banks to monitor financial transactions \r\nand commercial credits; the suspension of all funding \r\nby Arab States for projects on Syrian territories; \r\na request to all Arab airlines to stop their f lights \r\nto and from Syria; and — the following is a strange \r\nmeasure — the suspension of all the broadcasting of \r\nSyrian Government and private channels through \r\nArab satellites.\r\nI would like to ask the Arab League observer the \r\nfollowing question. If the foregoing measures do not \r\namount to an economic embargo against the Syrian \r\npeople, how does he comprehend the unilateral coercive \r\neconomic measures that the United Nations rejects, \r\ncondemns and calls for an end to?\r\nThe Acting President: I request the representative \r\nof the Syrian Arab Republic to kindly wrap up his \r\nstatement, as 10 minutes have elapsed.\r\nMr. Al-Arsan (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): In conclusion, we in Syria continue to \r\nbelieve that the League of Arab States can regain its \r\nrole and credibility. However, what we heard today \r\nfrom the League Observer confirms what we said this \r\nmorning, namely, that there is a movement afoot within \r\nthe organization to co-opt its decisions and stances \r\nand to oppose and silence the majority of the League \r\nmembership, which supports in deeds and not only in \r\nwords, the efforts that the Syrian Government is making \r\nto eliminate terrorism and move forward with a Syrian-\r\nled political process free of any foreign interference, \r\nwhile ensuring the return of refugees and internally \r\ndisplaced persons, reconstruction and recovery.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of sub-items (k), (l), (o), (u), (v), (w) and \r\n(y) of agenda item 128?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to appeal \r\nto those Member States intending to submit draft \r\nresolutions on the remaining sub-items to do so as soon \r\nas possible.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of the item and the remaining \r\nsub-items.\r\nAgenda item 133 (continued)\r\nImpact of rapid technological change on the \r\nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals\r\nDraft resolution (A/73/L.20)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Mexico to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.20.\r\nMr. Gómez Camacho (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nIt is an honour for Mexico to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.20, on the impact of rapid technological change \r\non the achievement of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) and targets.\r\nMexico is convinced that the General Assembly is \r\nthe ideal space to raise awareness among States and in \r\nour societies about the paradigm shift of technological \r\nprogress. This year we have witnessed the profound \r\nmultidimensional effects of rapid technological change, \r\nwhich affect all countries in the economic, social and \r\nenvironmental spheres. New technologies can change \r\nthe destiny of our nations and communities and are \r\npotential tools for States and agencies of the system to \r\nimplement public policies to achieve the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development.\r\nThe draft resolution before us seeks to strengthen \r\nthe United Nations architecture with regard to rapid \r\ntechnological change and the SDGs and their 169 targets. \r\nIt calls for coordination, which currently does not exist, \r\nbetween the Technology Facilitation Mechanism and its \r\nthree components and the Commission on Science and \r\nTechnology for Development. Artificial intelligence \r\nis mentioned as a key element among the technologies \r\nthat can help meet the 2030 Agenda. We call for the \r\nissue of technological change to be included as a topic \r\nin the next follow-up cycle of the implementation of \r\nthe Agenda and in the work of the high-level political \r\nforum and for its discussion in the regular agenda of the \r\nAssembly to be ensured.\r\n26/11/2018 A/73/PV.40\r\n18-40102 5/5\r\nWe are working to forge stronger links and \r\ncoordination within the United Nations system to take \r\nadvantage of the opportunities presented by rapid \r\ntechnological change. The emergence of these new \r\ntechnologies, in particular that of artificial intelligence, \r\nrepresents an evolutionary and existential challenge for \r\nhumankind. The debate must be broad and translated \r\ninto positive elements for our societies.\r\nAs the Foreign Minister of Mexico pointed out in \r\nthe General Assembly (see A/73/PV.22), the future of \r\nhumankind, in the light of these new technologies, is \r\nneither predestined nor unchangeable. It depends on the \r\nactions and decisions that we take together.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will \r\nnow take a decision on draft resolution A/73/L.20, \r\nentitled “Impact of rapid technological change on the \r\nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand targets”.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the submission of the draft resolution and \r\nin addition to those delegations listed in document \r\nA/73/L.20, the following countries have also become \r\nsponsors of: Andorra, Colombia, France, Liechtenstein, \r\nLuxembourg, Panama, South Africa, Switzerland and \r\nthe United Kingdom.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/73/L.20?\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.20 was adopted \r\n(resolution 73/17).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 133?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.30 p.m.\r\n"
