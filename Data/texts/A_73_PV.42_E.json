"United Nations A/73/PV.42\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n42nd plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 29 November 2018, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.25 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 39\r\nQuestion of Palestine\r\nReport of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People \r\n(А/73/35)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (А/73/346)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (А/73/201)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/73/L.31, A/73/L.32, \r\nА/73/L.33 and А/73/L.34)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nf loor to the Permanent Representative of Senegal, in \r\nhis capacity as Chair of the Committee on the Exercise \r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, \r\nto introduce draft resolutions A/73/L.31, A/73/L.32, \r\nA/73/L.33 and A/73/L.34.\r\nMr. Niang (Senegal) (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People, I would like to reiterate \r\nto you, Madam President, our deep gratitude for your \r\noutstanding personal participation in yesterday’s \r\nspecial meeting in observance of the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People (see \r\nA/AC.183/PV.393). The members of the Committee \r\nparticularly appreciated the far-reaching message you \r\nsent to the international community, urging it to work \r\nto translate solidarity with the Palestinian people into \r\nconcrete action.\r\nI would also like to thank Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres, the representatives of civil society \r\nand, above all, the Member States for their exceptional \r\nefforts to mobilize on this issue, including at the level of \r\nthe Permanent Representatives. In a worrying context, \r\nmarked in particular by the absence of a clear political \r\nhorizon, that mobilization is eloquent testimony to the \r\ninternational community’s continued commitment to \r\na two-State solution, with Israel and Palestine living \r\nside by side, in peace and security, within the pre-1967 \r\nborders, and with East Jerusalem as the capital of a \r\nState of Palestine.\r\nIn accordance with the mandate conferred on it by \r\nthe Assembly, the Committee, for its part, will continue \r\nto work with all actors, particularly Member States, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society, to keep \r\nthe Palestinian question on the international agenda \r\nuntil the Palestinian people, like the Israeli people, can \r\nfully exercise their inalienable rights, including the \r\nright to self-determination and autonomy. Of course, \r\nthe peace that we all want can be achieved only with the \r\nwill and involvement of the parties to the dispute — the \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians — who alone, in the end, can \r\nwork towards a definitive solution that guarantees \r\nsecurity, cooperation and prosperity. In this regard, the \r\nCommittee encourages the ongoing efforts to restore \r\nunity among Palestinian political actors in order to \r\nenable them to take charge of their people’s aspirations \r\nto dignity and justice.\r\nI will now proceed to introduce the four draft \r\nresolutions under agenda item 39, contained in documents \r\nA/73/L.31, A/73/L.32, A/73/L.33 and A/73/L.34.

The \r\ndraft resolutions relate, first, to the peaceful settlement \r\nof the question of Palestine; secondly, to the mandate \r\nof the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People; thirdly, to the work of \r\nthe Division for Palestinian Rights of the Secretariat; \r\nand fourthly, to the special information programme \r\non the question of Palestine of the Department of \r\nPublic Information.\r\nWith regard to the draft resolution entitled \r\n“Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine”, \r\ncontained in document A/73/L.32, the Assembly, \r\nguided by paragraph 5 of Security Council resolution \r\n2334 (2016), urges States in paragraph 24 of the draft\r\n“(a) [N]ot to recognize any changes to the pre-\r\n1967 borders, including with regard to Jerusalem, \r\nother than those agreed by the parties through \r\nnegotiations; (b) To distinguish, in their relevant \r\ndealings, between the territory of the State of \r\nIsrael and the territories occupied since 1967; \r\n(c) Not to render aid or assistance to illegal \r\nsettlement activities”.\r\nIn addition, taking into account the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the Israeli occupation and the seventieth \r\nanniversary of resolution 181 (II), of 29 November 1947, \r\nthe Assembly, in draft resolution A/73/L.31, requests \r\nour Committee, among other things, to ensure that the \r\ninternational community redoubles its efforts aimed \r\nat achieving a peaceful settlement of the question \r\nof Palestine. In this respect, it is important to work \r\ntowards an expanded multilateral framework with a \r\nview to relaunching the peace process, which has been \r\nstalled since 2014. In this regard, Governments and \r\nother international organizations are invited to assist \r\nthe Committee in implementing its mandate.\r\nIn draft resolution A/73/L.34, the Assembly renews \r\nthe mandate of the Division for Palestinian Rights of \r\nthe Secretariat and requests that it continue to assist \r\nthe Committee in the exercise of its mandate and in its \r\ncontribution to raising international public awareness \r\nof the question of Palestine.\r\nFinally, the draft resolution on the special \r\ninformation programme on the question of Palestine, \r\ncontained in document A/73/L.33, calls on the \r\nDepartment of Public Information to continue to \r\ninvolve the media in efforts to achieve peace between \r\nPalestinians and Israelis.\r\nIn view of the foregoing, the Committee, through \r\nme, urges Member States to continue to give their full \r\nsupport to these draft resolutions, as they have done in \r\nthe past, with a view to sending a message of hope to \r\nthe Palestinian people, who still continue to have faith \r\nin the work of the United Nations.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give \r\nthe f loor to the Rapporteur of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople to introduce the Committee’s report.\r\nMr. Inguanez (Malta): It is an honour for me, in my \r\ncapacity as Rapporteur of the Committee on the Exercise \r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, to \r\npresent to the General Assembly the annual report of \r\nthe Committee, contained in document A/73/35. The \r\nreport covers developments relating to the question \r\nof Palestine and details the work of the Committee \r\nbetween 6 September 2017 and 4 September 2018.\r\nThe report is organized into seven chapters. Chapter \r\nI contains an introduction to the report. Chapter II \r\nconsists of a review by the Committee of the political \r\ncontext relating to the question of Palestine during the \r\nreporting period. Chapters III and IV of the report outline \r\nthe mandate entrusted to the Committee by the General \r\nAssembly and contain information on the organization \r\nof the Committee’s work during the review period. \r\nChapter V covers the action taken by the Committee, \r\nincluding the Chair’s participation in Security Council \r\ndebates and the Committee’s continuing dialogue with \r\nintergovernmental and civil-society organizations. The \r\nchapter also describes the international conferences \r\norganized by the Committee, visits by the Committee’s \r\ndelegation, and other mandated activities carried out by \r\nthe Division for Palestinian Rights. Chapter VI provides \r\nan overview of the special information programme on \r\nthe question of Palestine carried out by the Department \r\nof Public Information pursuant to resolution 72/12, of \r\n30 November 2017. Chapter VII of the report contains \r\nthe Committee’s conclusions and recommendations to \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nRecalling that 2018 marks the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the displacement of Palestine refugees \r\nfrom their homeland in 1948, remembered as the \r\nNakba, or “catastrophe”, and the fifty-first anniversary \r\nof the Israeli occupation, the Committee urges the \r\ninternational community to redouble its efforts to \r\n28/11/2018 A/73/PV.42\r\n18-40195 3/24\r\nachieve a two-State solution based on the 1967 borders, \r\nin accordance with international law, the relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, the Madrid principles, the \r\nArab Peace Initiative and the road map of the Quartet.\r\nThe Committee deems null and void unilateral \r\ndecisions by Member States to recognize Jerusalem \r\nas the capital of Israel and transfer embassies in Israel \r\nfrom Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and calls on them to \r\nrescind those decisions. It reiterates the need to reframe \r\nthe Palestinian-Israeli conflict from a territorial \r\ndispute between two equal parties to that of one State \r\noccupying, colonizing and annexing the territory of \r\nanother State. It supports revising the existing model \r\nof bilateral negotiations into an expanded multilateral \r\nframework and welcomes the eight-point plan \r\npresented to the Security Council on 20 February by \r\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas of the State of Palestine. \r\nThe Committee encourages and offers its support to all \r\nefforts to advance intra-Palestinian unity, calls on the \r\ninternational community to shift from a humanitarian \r\nto a political and human rights framework in addressing \r\nthe plight of the Palestinian people and demands an \r\nend to the 11-year-old Israeli air, land and sea blockade \r\nof Gaza.\r\nThe Committee urges the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly to ensure accountability and \r\nthe implementation of their long-standing resolutions, \r\nincluding Security Council resolution 2334 (2016). The \r\nCommittee underscores the responsibility of States \r\nand private entities not to contribute to grave Israeli \r\nviolations of Palestinian human rights, particularly \r\nwith respect to settlements in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem. It looks forward \r\nto the expedited operationalization of the database on \r\nbusiness enterprises involved in activities connected \r\nwith Israeli settlements, as mandated by Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolution 31/36, of 2016.\r\nThe Committee deplores the use by Israeli forces \r\nof excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force \r\nagainst Palestinian civilians, and emphasizes the need \r\nfor the implementation of an international protection \r\nmechanism. In this regard, the Committee looks forward \r\nto the report of the Human Rights Council-mandated \r\nCommission of Inquiry into violations committed on \r\nthe fence between Israel and the Gaza Strip during the \r\nGreat March of Return protests.\r\nFinally, the Committee emphasizes the importance \r\nof the acknowledgement by Israel of the Nakba and its \r\nimpact on the Palestinian people, and further encourages \r\nall Member States to provide the United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East with sufficient and predictable funding.\r\nIn the implementation of its mandate, the \r\nCommittee will continue to enhance its cooperation \r\nwith the League of Arab States and the Organization for \r\nIslamic Cooperation, and calls on other international \r\nand regional organizations, especially the European \r\nUnion, to take on a more politically active role in \r\nmediating an end to the conflict. The Committee \r\nwill also enhance its outreach to all Member States \r\nand regional groups at the United Nations with a \r\nview to taking a more effective approach towards the \r\nachievement of a two-State solution and to expanding \r\nthe Committee’s membership.\r\nThe Committee will continue to expand its efforts \r\nto engage civil society, and encourages civil-society \r\npartners to work with their national Governments, \r\nparliamentarians and other institutions to promote the \r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people and to fully \r\nrecognize the State of Palestine and its independence.\r\nThe Committee notes with appreciation the work \r\nof the Division for Palestinian Rights and requests the \r\nDivision to continue providing substantive Secretariat \r\nsupport for the Committee’s mandate. The Committee \r\nrequests the continuation of the Department of Public \r\nInformation’s special information programme on the \r\nquestion of Palestine, which has made an important \r\ncontribution to informing the media and the public.\r\nIn conclusion, I am seeking the support of my \r\ncolleagues on draft resolutions A/73/L.31, A/73/L.32, \r\nА/73/L.33 and А/73/L.34, endorsed unanimously by \r\nthe Committee, for adoption by the General Assembly.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nf loor to the Permanent Observer of the Observer State \r\nof Palestine.\r\nMr. Mansour (Palestine): At the outset, I want to \r\nconvey to you, Madam President, and through you, to \r\nthe General Assembly family that has so long stood \r\non the side of justice, our profound appreciation for \r\nthe principled positions and meaningful support that \r\nthe Assembly continues to extend to the Palestinian \r\npeople. As we once again mark the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, we are reminded \r\nof the breadth of global support for the just cause of \r\nPalestine, and are deeply grateful.\r\nA/73/PV.42 28/11/2018\r\n4/24 18-40195\r\nDespite the misfortunes and continuing hardships, \r\ndisappointments and crises endured by the Palestinian \r\npeople, we remain firm in our conviction in the justness \r\nand dignity of our cause and steadfast in our belief that \r\nwith the Assembly’s collective support, this injustice \r\nwill ultimately be brought to an end.\r\nEven at this existential moment — 71 years after the \r\nAssembly’s adoption of resolution 181 (II) partitioning \r\nPalestine against the will and rights of our people, more \r\nthan 70 years after the Nakba and after more than 50 \r\nyears of Israel’s foreign occupation, and considering \r\nall that has been lost and suffered by our people and \r\nregion, generation after generation, and in the face of \r\ndiminishing hopes and rising challenges — we remain \r\ndetermined to realize the inalienable rights of our \r\npeople so that they may finally live in freedom, peace \r\nand security in their homeland.\r\nOn this day of solidarity, we reiterate our ongoing \r\nappeal to the international community — to all States, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society — to \r\nstrengthen their resolve to fulfil their obligations to \r\nmake a just peace a reality. We want to recall here the \r\nhistoric significance of collective action in overcoming \r\ninjustice and resolving conflict, as seen in the defeat \r\nof apartheid, colonialism and the scourge of world \r\nwars past.\r\nThe path we have chosen to take to solve the \r\nPalestine question, the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, \r\nis a peaceful one. We are committed to diplomatic, \r\npolitical, legal and non-violent means to realize our \r\nrights, in the belief that respect for international law is \r\nessential to credible negotiations and is the fundamental \r\nbasis of a solution. Despite blows to the credibility \r\nof the Security Council and General Assembly, we \r\nmaintain our faith in their authority and capacities \r\nto uphold the law in order to reach a just, lasting and \r\npeaceful solution to a question that has vexed the United \r\nNations since its inception. Our faith must be shared \r\nby all who still believe in the purposes and principles \r\nof the Organization, the rule of law and the true spirit \r\nof multilateralism.\r\nIf we did not believe, how could we possibly \r\ncontinue to engage the Assembly, and on this tragic \r\nanniversary in particular? How could we continue \r\nmaking our appeals, resolution after resolution, even \r\nas the situation worsens with Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, entrenching its occupation of our land, \r\nintensifying its oppression of our people, destroying \r\nthe prospects for peace and dismantling the possibility \r\nof two-State solution settlement by settlement, even \r\nas we are subjected to punitive measures — from the \r\nUnited States decision on Jerusalem a year ago, to its \r\ntermination of funding for the United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \r\nEast (UNRWA), after decades as its largest donor, to \r\nattempts to strip Palestine refugees of their legitimate \r\nstatus and rights, to constant distortions of reality and \r\nthe underlying issues, and the list goes on — all for \r\nrefusing to capitulate to injustice and for demanding \r\nour rights and freedom?\r\nOnly a deep belief in the law and the inevitability of \r\njustice could have kept us on this path. This should be \r\nseen as remarkable, considering that Israel’s violations \r\nand war crimes continue to be rewarded rather than \r\npunished by the international community, making it \r\nextraordinarily difficult to continue justifying our \r\nchoice of a peaceful path and convincing our people, \r\nespecially our young people, of its logic and benefits, \r\nwhen they experience none at all in their daily lives \r\nand see no possibility whatever of a future free of \r\noccupation, conflict and want. The dangers of the \r\ncurrent situation cannot be overstated. The huge gap \r\nbetween our lofty beliefs and the abhorrent realities \r\non the ground must be quickly remedied before it is \r\ntoo late — for Palestinians, Israelis and the region as \r\na whole.\r\nIsrael is in grave breach of virtually all international \r\nlegal obligations, particularly the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention. It acts with blatant contempt for the Security \r\nCouncil, not only violating resolution 2334 (2016) and \r\nall other relevant resolutions, but even bragging of its \r\nviolations and mocking the international community’s \r\nfailure to hold it accountable. As Israel ignores \r\ndemands to cease its illegal policies and practices in \r\noccupied Palestine, including East Jerusalem, and to \r\nreverse negative trends on the ground, the destructive \r\ntoll of its colonization, dispossession, oppression and \r\ndeprivation of our people continues to climb, and it is \r\nsystematically destroying the possibility of a two-State \r\nsolution on the basis of the pre-1967 borders.\r\nIn the past year, we saw the continuation of illegal \r\nIsraeli settlement activities in the West Bank, especially \r\nin and around East Jerusalem, including the construction \r\nand expansion of settlements, the construction of the \r\nannexation wall, the transfer of settlers, the theft of \r\nPalestinian land, the demolition of Palestinian homes \r\nand properties, the forced displacement of Palestinian \r\n28/11/2018 A/73/PV.42\r\n18-40195 5/24\r\ncivilians and attempts to forcibly transfer entire \r\ncommunities, such as the Bedouin village of Khan \r\nAl-Ahmar/Abu Al-Helu, and the massive exploitation \r\nof our natural resources.\r\nThe occupying Power and its extremists also \r\npersisted in provocations against holy sites, particularly \r\nin occupied East Jerusalem, including at Al-Haram \r\nAl-Sharif, thereby violating the historic status quo and \r\nstirring religious tensions. That has been accompanied \r\nby inflammatory rhetoric and incitement by the Israeli \r\nGovernment, military officials and settler extremists that \r\nfuel hatred, violence and terror against Palestinians, as \r\nwell as lethal military raids and settler attacks that cause \r\ndeath and injury to our civilians, including children, \r\nand the ongoing arrest, detention, imprisonment, abuse \r\nand torture of thousands of Palestinians.\r\nIsrael has also continued its collective punishment \r\nof the Palestinian civilian population, violating \r\nevery kind of human right. The most heinous of such \r\nrestrictions remains Israel’s 11-year blockade of Gaza, \r\nwhere 2 million Palestinians are being deliberately \r\nisolated and deprived in what has tragically become \r\nknown as the world’s only open-air prison. The dire \r\nhumanitarian crisis and suffocating poverty caused by \r\nthis illegal blockade are at the root of the deep despair \r\nthat has fuelled the Great March of Return, to which \r\nIsrael has responded with typical aggression and \r\ncruelty, killing more than 220 Palestinians, including \r\nat least 45 children, and injuring more than 24,000, \r\nfurther traumatizing our defenceless population, \r\nwhich remains in need of international protection. \r\nThis situation is beyond inhumane and requires urgent \r\nredress, beginning with the lifting of the blockade.\r\nIn addition, the Israeli Government, led by extremist \r\nmembers of the Prime Minister’s coalition and aided \r\nby the so-called justice system, continues promoting \r\ndiscriminatory racist laws designed to further \r\ndispossess, marginalize and dehumanize Palestinians \r\nand facilitate Israel’s annexation aims. The most \r\noffensive of those laws is the recent Jewish nation-State \r\nbill, which has led many to rightly view the prevailing \r\nsituation as akin to an apartheid regime. In Israel, only \r\nJews are entitled to self-determination. The 21 per \r\ncent of the Israeli population that is Palestinian Arab \r\nis denied that right. If discrimination on the basis of \r\nreligious affiliation does not constitute discrimination \r\npar excellence, I want the General Assembly to tell me \r\nwhat discrimination is.\r\nIsrael’s occupation of Palestinian and Arab lands \r\nlong ago crossed the threshold of illegality and cannot \r\nbe defended or justified in any way. Not only is it the \r\nroot cause of grave human suffering, insecurity and \r\ninstability in our region, its protraction has eroded the \r\nrule of law and the perception of justice in the Middle \r\nEast and beyond, feeding a culture of impunity that \r\nthreatens the international system’s viability.\r\nWe therefore once again call for urgent action. The \r\ninternational community cannot continue to decry the \r\nviolations of Palestinian rights and the destruction of the \r\ntwo-State solution without acting to end this unlawful \r\nsituation. Measures of accountability and proactive and \r\ncollective peace efforts are imperative. We therefore \r\nappeal to all States to do the following.\r\nFirst, States must uphold international law \r\nregarding the Palestine question, including through \r\nsupport for relevant resolutions and mobilization of the \r\npolitical will to implement those resolutions in order \r\nto help resolve the conflict and establish a just and \r\nlasting peace.\r\nSecondly, States must affirm support for the \r\nPalestinian people and their inalienable rights by \r\nupholding international law, recognizing the State of \r\nPalestine on the basis of the pre-1967 borders, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital, and providing humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment support, including to Palestine refugees \r\nthrough UNRWA, pending a just solution to their plight \r\npursuant to resolution 194 (III).\r\nThirdly, States must ensure they are not complicit \r\nwith Israel’s illegal actions, including by not recognizing \r\nas legitimate the unlawful situation created by Israel’s \r\npolicies and measures in occupied Palestine, including \r\nEast Jerusalem, or as a result of its settlement activities, \r\nby not rendering aid to maintain that unlawful situation, \r\nand by making a clear distinction in all of their relevant \r\ndealings between the territory of the occupying Power \r\nand the territory occupied since 1967, as called for by \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2334 (2016).\r\nFourthly, they must ensure accountability, including \r\nthrough practical measures, in order to ensure respect \r\nfor the Charter of the United Nations and implement \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, uphold international \r\nhumanitarian law obligations as high contracting parties \r\nto the Geneva Conventions, support the activation of \r\ninternational accountability mechanisms and pursue \r\nmeasures to hold the Israeli Government, organizations \r\nA/73/PV.42 28/11/2018\r\n6/24 18-40195\r\nand individuals accountable for their illegal actions at \r\nthe political, diplomatic, legal and economic levels.\r\nIt is a stark equation. As long as the benefits \r\noutweigh the costs, Israel will continue to impose \r\nits illegal occupation and trample on the Charter and \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. Accountability is key to \r\nending impunity. States must act on their commitments \r\nand end the double standard of rewarding Israel for its \r\nillegal behaviour rather than punishing it.\r\nIn this context, we cannot allow the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations and its Member States to contribute to \r\na just solution to be mocked as biased or one-sided, as \r\nfalsely claimed by Israel and those who try to absolve it \r\nof its crimes. Nor can we accept accusations that United \r\nNations resolutions are anti-Israel. They are not. They \r\nare founded entirely on international law and the global \r\nconsensus on the parameters of a solution in conformity \r\nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions, the Madrid \r\nprinciples, the Arab Peace Initiative and the Quartet \r\nroad map, at the heart of which is a two-State solution \r\nfor Palestine and Israel.\r\nWe urge all members to reject the exploitation of \r\nthe General Assembly for punitive purposes that have \r\nno legal basis, deflect attention from the root causes of \r\nthe conflict and undermine our collective efforts for a \r\njust peace. We appeal to the Assembly to stand firmly \r\nin support of the rights of the Palestinian people and \r\nthe two-State solution and in defence of international \r\nlaw and true multilateralism in the face of the serious \r\nchallenges to all of them.\r\nIn conclusion, we reiterate our gratitude to the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People for its support and constant efforts \r\naimed at achieving a just, lasting, comprehensive peace, \r\nwhereby the State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital, can live side by side with Israel based on \r\nthe pre-1967 borders, in peace and security. We urge \r\nall Member States to cooperate with and support the \r\nCommittee, in line with the relevant resolutions and the \r\nOrganization’s permanent responsibility with respect \r\nto the Palestine question.\r\nWe thank Senegal, Chair of the Committee, for \r\nassuming this important role over the years. We also \r\nthank all the other Bureau members — the Vice-Chairs \r\nAfghanistan, Cuba, Indonesia, Namibia and Nicaragua, \r\nand the Rapporteur, Malta — and all Committee \r\nmembers and observers for their principled support. \r\nWe thank the Division for Palestinian Rights and the \r\nDepartment of Public Information’s special information \r\nprogramme on the question of Palestine for their efforts.\r\nToday we also want to reiterate our appreciation to \r\nSecretary-General António Guterres for his relevant \r\nreports and his leadership of the Organization’s efforts \r\non the question of Palestine, including the work of his \r\nPersonal Representative and Special Coordinator for \r\nthe Middle East Peace Process, and the tireless efforts \r\nof the many United Nations agencies assisting the \r\nPalestinian people, with UNRWA at their forefront, and \r\nwith the generous support of States, organizations and \r\npartners from around the world. This vital support must \r\ncontinue, and we urge the international community to \r\nintensify efforts to fulfil its political, legal and moral \r\nobligations to resolve this grave injustice and achieve a \r\njust and lasting peace.\r\nMr. Danon (Israel): Every year the United Nations \r\nadopts at least 20 resolutions aimed specifically at \r\ncondemning Israel. Not a single one of those resolutions, \r\nor any General Assembly resolution, has ever included \r\nHamas. These resolutions make a mockery of the \r\nPalestinians, the very people the United Nations claims \r\nto defend. Rather than leading Palestinians forward to \r\nthe future, they keep them locked in the past.\r\nThe annual draft resolutions set forth today will \r\nlikely be adopted once more, which is not surprising. \r\nBut the international community has had an opportunity \r\nto take a moral stance and finally condemn Hamas, \r\nwhich is internationally recognized as a terrorist \r\norganization that is guilty of launching thousands of \r\nrockets into Israel, endangering Israeli civilians and \r\ntorching our land; stealing aid funding from civilians \r\nin Gaza to construct military infrastructure, including \r\nterror tunnels; using the people of Gaza as human \r\nshields; and holding hostage the bodies of Oron Shaul \r\nand Hadar Goldin, who were abducted and murdered by \r\nHamas in 2014, as well as Avera Mengistu and Hisham \r\nAl-Sayed, two Israeli civilians. If the international \r\ncommunity does not condemn Hamas, it is enabling a \r\nterrorist organization.\r\nIsrael’s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, \r\nonce said that in order to be a realist in Israel, one \r\nmust believe in miracles. The historic homeland of \r\nthe Jewish people, the land of Israel, was conquered, \r\ndestroyed, rebuilt and demolished again. For centuries, \r\nit remained a barren desert as it passed from empire to \r\nempire, from the Canaanites to the ancient Egyptians \r\nto the Babylonians to the Ottoman Turks and the \r\n28/11/2018 A/73/PV.42\r\n18-40195 7/24\r\nBritish, with countless other Powers in between. Our \r\npeople were exiled from our land but continued to \r\ndream of it every holiday, three times a day in prayer \r\nand throughout the never-ending anti-Semitism that we \r\ncould not escape. But on this day 71 years ago, our \r\nage-old dream became a real-life miracle. In this Hall, \r\n33 Member States voted in favour of a plan that would \r\ndesignate what was only a small portion of the land \r\nof Israel towards the most liberating end possible, the \r\nself-determination of the Jewish people (see A/PV.128).\r\nImmediately we said yes. We were grateful to get \r\neven a piece of our homeland. But from that dream-\r\ncome-true moment, the Jewish State of Israel has never \r\nexperienced true peace. We have faced wars, terrorism, \r\nthreats, isolation, double standards and anti-Semitism, \r\nbut we have never let that stop us from building \r\nsomething miraculous — creating an oasis in the \r\ndesert with drip irrigation, forming the most successful \r\nknowledge-based economy in the world and installing \r\nthe one and only democracy for hundreds of miles. \r\nOne need only look at the map. Nothing has stood in \r\nour way.\r\nThe adoption of resolution 181 (II) on 29 November \r\n1947 did not give us everything that we wanted, but \r\nwe accepted what we were given with gratitude and \r\nturned it into something extraordinary. However, our \r\nPalestinian neighbours did not share this mindset. \r\nRather than accepting reality and making something \r\nof it, they rejected it entirely. They did not say “but” \r\nor “maybe”, they said “no”. As soon as the partition \r\nresolution was adopted, 71 years ago, the Palestinians \r\nbegan teaching their children to hate ours. They \r\ncemented their hopes in an unrealistic past and refused \r\nto move forward, and they have stayed there ever since. \r\nIt is about time that the Palestinians hit the reset button. \r\nThey must recalculate their route so that partnerships, \r\nprosperity and peace can be possible.\r\nIsrael represents seven decades of miracles, and \r\na beacon of democratic freedoms and human rights, \r\nthat even our adversaries in this Hall cannot deny. \r\nIsraeli elections are free and fair. Israelis enjoy full \r\nfreedom of speech. Israeli media outlets are entirely \r\nfree to criticize their Government, while such blatant \r\ncriticism would be unheard of in any other country in \r\nthe Middle East. Israel champions equal rights for all of \r\nits people. Women make up 28 per cent of the Knesset, \r\nour Parliament, and our current Ministers of Justice, \r\nSocial Equality and Culture are women. An entire \r\nsector of start-up ecosystems is dedicated to improving \r\nthe lives of people with disabilities. One company, \r\nwhich has expanded all over the world, has invented an \r\nexoskeleton system that actually enables people with \r\nspinal-cord damage to walk again.\r\nOur freedom allows us to develop great ideas and \r\nsend them around the entire world, from agricultural \r\ninnovations that use satellite technology to track \r\nenvironmental trends, to health-care breakthroughs that \r\ncan detect early-stage cancer tumours without resort to \r\nbiopsies, or to counter-terrorism technologies keeping \r\nall of us safe by using facial-recognition technologies. \r\nWe are eager to share our knowledge, expertise and \r\ncapabilities with our friends around the globe. Israel \r\nbelieves in an ever-changing world. Even when we had \r\nnothing we still built something remarkable. It is our \r\npart of our DNA.\r\nBut the Palestinians have shown no interest in \r\nimprovement. Since the moment of the voting on \r\nresolution 181 (II), the Palestinians have wasted \r\ndecades spreading hatred and sponsoring terrorism. \r\nInstead of inventions they choose incitement. Instead of \r\nventures they choose violence, and in lieu of progress \r\nthey choose the past.\r\nSince the moment that the United Nations voted \r\nto recognize a Jewish State and an Arab State, all we \r\nhave heard is “no”: no to peace, no to negotiations, \r\nno to dialogue. Every time we reach out with an open \r\nhand, we are met not just with a clenched fist but with \r\nan armed one. We face a Palestinian leadership that \r\nis so problematic that only 29 per cent of Palestinians \r\ntrust it to be able to hold free and fair elections. \r\nMahmoud Abbas was elected in 2005. Those were the \r\nlast Palestinian Authority elections ever held. Abbas is \r\nin the thirteenth year of his four-year term. We see a \r\nPalestinian media industry whose members are more \r\noften found in prison or dead than reporting on the \r\nground. In the words of one journalist detained by the \r\nPalestinian Authority, “I live in a country where it is \r\nforbidden to express my opinion”. We have watched, \r\ndisturbed, as nearly 50 per cent of married Palestinian \r\nwomen in Gaza have experienced domestic violence.\r\nIt is no secret that the Palestinian leadership \r\nsponsors terrorism. This past year, Mahmoud Abbas \r\nallocated $355 million to terrorist salaries. I repeat: \r\n$355 million. That number is more than 45 per cent of \r\nthe foreign aid that the Palestinians will receive this \r\nyear from all of the Member States here. The current \r\nPalestinian leadership is not capable of leading. It is not \r\nA/73/PV.42 28/11/2018\r\n8/24 18-40195\r\ninterested in the responsibilities of governing, making \r\nhard choices, delivering on promises to its people or \r\ninvesting in its own institutions. The Palestinians \r\ncould surge ahead into the future, but instead they have \r\nchosen to incite violence and terrorism and to deny the \r\nconnection of the Jewish people to the land of Israel. \r\nIf they were truly interested in creating a better life \r\nfor their people, they would devote their energy to \r\nmaking peace.\r\nIsrael is sprinting into the future. We want the \r\nPalestinian people to sprint with us, to build their \r\neconomy and make progress towards peace, but the \r\nPalestinians have shown no interest in accepting \r\nreality and making something of it. For example, in \r\n2005 Israel completely pulled out of the Gaza Strip. \r\nWe have absolutely no presence there. We removed \r\nall of the Jewish communities. We sent our soldiers \r\nhome. We even uprooted our cemeteries. One cannot \r\nfind a single Jew in Gaza today. The Palestinians \r\nhad the opportunity to transform Gaza into the new \r\npearl of the Mediterranean, but instead they elected \r\nHamas, and Gaza became a terminal for terror. There \r\nis high potential for a successful Palestinian economy, \r\nespecially one centred on high-tech and start-up \r\nculture, but the roadblock to its success is a corrupt \r\nPalestinian leadership.\r\nWith 65 per cent of Palestinians pessimistic about \r\ntheir future, it is high time that the Palestinians took \r\nthree drastic measures for change. I would like to share \r\nthose measure with the Palestinians.\r\nFirst, they must reject their rejectionism. Israel \r\nis here to stay. The idea that if they ignore us we \r\nwill go away is false and a waste of energy. Instead, \r\nPalestinians should focus on building a better future \r\nfor their children and leave hatred behind. Secondly, \r\nthey must stop teaching hatred and paying terrorists. \r\nThey should teach tolerance and pay teachers instead. \r\nThirdly, if they are frustrated with the status quo, \r\nthey should change it, replace their current corrupt \r\nleadership and elect a leader who cares about them. \r\nOnly when these three measures are taken will peace \r\nbe possible.\r\nThe world cannot expect different results using \r\nthe same equation. If it expects to see change for \r\nPalestinians and Israelis, it must change the equation. It \r\nshould not cooperate with the Palestinians as they bring \r\nempty draft resolutions and symbolic gestures to the \r\nUnited Nations. It should not fuel the fire of delusion. \r\nInstead, it should take responsibility for ensuring that \r\nthe Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish State. The \r\nPalestinians should end the campaign of incitement \r\nand, finally, elect responsible leadership.\r\nWhat the world has seen from Israel over the past \r\n71 years is only the beginning. We are committed to \r\ninfinite prosperity in partnership with our neighbours, \r\nbut if the Palestinians choose not to join us, we will \r\nnot let their hostility hold us back. The Jewish people \r\nwill continue to f lourish regardless of the obstacles that \r\ncome their way. We will continue to be courageous in \r\nour aspirations, prosperity and quest for peace. As it is \r\nwritten in chapter 29, verse 11, of the Book of Psalms of \r\nthe Holy Bible, “May God give strength to his people; \r\nmay God bless his people with peace”.\r\nMs. Bahous (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank you, Madam President, for \r\nyour able stewardship of today’s meeting.\r\nOn this International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People, we are pleased to convey our sincere \r\nthanks and appreciation to the Chair and members \r\nof the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People for their tireless efforts \r\naimed at defending the rights of our brother Palestinian \r\npeople, mobilizing international support for them and \r\ntheir just cause, and standing up to all attempts to \r\nundermine and deny their rights. These efforts have \r\nbeen very effective in keeping the issue of the rights \r\nof Palestinian people at the centre of the international \r\ncommunity’s priorities and concerns, and in keeping \r\nGovernments, intergovernmental organizations, civil-\r\nsociety organizations and the media focused on the \r\nurgent need to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict \r\nand fulfil the aspirations of the Palestinians to establish \r\ntheir independent State on their national territory.\r\nYesterday His Majesty King Abdullah II Ibn \r\nAl-Hussein of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan sent a \r\nmessage to the Chair of the Committee on the Exercise \r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People on \r\nthe occasion of the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People. In his letter, King Abdullah \r\nasserted that the Palestinian question is key to \r\nachieving peace and stability in the Middle East and \r\nthat all final status issues, including those of Jerusalem \r\nand refugees’ right of return and right to compensation, \r\nmust be resolved through serious negotiations and a \r\ncomprehensive settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli \r\nconflict in accordance with the relevant international \r\n28/11/2018 A/73/PV.42\r\n18-40195 9/24\r\nresolutions. The King stressed that there is no \r\nalternative to a two-State solution or to establishing \r\na sovereign and viable independent Palestinian State \r\nwithin the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital. The Palestinian question remains a central \r\nissue in the Middle East, and comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace is the strategic option of choice among \r\nArabs, embodied by the Arab Peace Initiative adopted \r\nby all Arab States and supported by the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation.\r\nJordan enjoys excellent relations with Palestine \r\nand its brotherly people. We are organically linked \r\nby historical, civilizational, cultural, humanitarian \r\nand geographical ties. Since the Palestinian question \r\nfirst arose, Jordan’s political and diplomatic efforts \r\nhave focused on guaranteeing the legitimate rights \r\nof the Palestinian people under international law, \r\nbased on the principles on which the United Nations \r\nwas founded, including settling disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans, refraining from the use of force and rejecting \r\nviolence, and striving to cooperate with all States and \r\ninternational actors to achieve those ends. Our values \r\nand principles guide us to address, to the best of our \r\nability, the human suffering of the Palestinian people \r\nwho have been denied their most basic and recognized \r\ninternational rights to freedom, self-determination and \r\nthe establishment of an independent State on their own \r\nnational territory.\r\nThe harsh living conditions and worsening human \r\nplight faced by the Palestinian people, particularly in \r\nthe Gaza Strip, have increased poverty, frustration and \r\ndespair, and call for immediate and serious action. The \r\nblockade on Gaza must be lifted and the humanitarian \r\ndisaster there ended. In Jordan, we will continue \r\nto provide every form of support to our Palestinian \r\nbrothers and work in all international forums to focus \r\nthe world’s attention on the terrible suffering of our \r\nbrothers and sisters and on their just cause.\r\nAs Jordan is Palestine’s next-door neighbour, our \r\npeople, particularly those living in Jerusalem, are \r\nkeenly aware of the daily suffering of the Palestinian \r\npeople. The Hashemite custodianship of the Islamic \r\nand Christian holy sites in Jerusalem is a historic \r\nresponsibility that Jordan has been honoured to assume \r\non behalf of the Arab and Islamic nations. We will \r\ncontinue to fulfil our role in opposing any attempt to \r\nchange the current historical and legal status of those \r\nsites, and to counter any efforts to partition Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque/Al-Haram Al-Quds Al-Sharif, temporally or \r\nspatially. We must work together to defend Jerusalem \r\nand address any attempts to impose a new reality on the \r\ncity, which would have disastrous repercussions on the \r\nfuture stability of the region.\r\nAny rollback in services provided by the United \r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA), and any attempt \r\nto undermine the Agency’s role as set forth in its United \r\nNations mandate, would trigger grave consequences, \r\nparticularly at a time when there are no prospects \r\nfor an end to the occupation or for a resolution of the \r\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict on the basis of a two-State \r\nsolution. We will therefore continue to spare no effort to \r\nmobilize international political and financial support for \r\nUNRWA so that it can continue to do its work pursuant \r\nto its United Nations mandate, for the benefit of the \r\nmore than 5 million Palestinian refugees. Safeguarding \r\nUNRWA means respecting the right of refugees to live \r\nin dignity, the right of more than 500,000 students \r\nto attend school and the right of Palestinian refugees \r\nto receive health care and basic living necessities. It \r\nalso means asserting the right of refugees to return \r\nand get compensation under the relevant international \r\nresolutions. Jordan will play a pivotal role in resolving \r\nthis issue within the framework of the comprehensive \r\nfinal status solution involving refugees in accordance \r\nwith the relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nGiven the tragic and deteriorating situation of the \r\nPalestinian people that has resulted from the ongoing \r\narbitrary Israeli occupation and Israel’s illegal and \r\nillegitimate settlement activities, arbitrary detentions \r\nand assassinations, we must work hand in hand with \r\nall those who advocate peace, righteousness and justice \r\nand who believe in international legitimacy as the \r\nmeans to end those practices. Continuing this conflict \r\nwill lead to further violence, terrorism and hatred \r\nthroughout the world. We must work together to achieve \r\na comprehensive and just peace between Palestinians \r\nand Israelis, a peace that ends the injustice being done \r\nto the Palestinian people and their suffering, and one \r\nthat ensures freedom, progress and prosperity for them \r\nin their independent and sovereign State, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital.\r\nMr. Elmajerbi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): Today \r\nthe General Assembly is taking up the long-standing \r\nissue of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian and \r\nother Arab territories in the light of the reports of the \r\nSecretary-General entitled “Peaceful settlement of the \r\nquestion of Palestine” (A/73/346) and “The situation \r\nA/73/PV.42 28/11/2018\r\n10/24 18-40195\r\nin the Middle East” (A/73/322), and the report of the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People (A/73/35).\r\nWhat continues to boggle the mind is that these \r\nreports unequivocally demonstrate the just cause of the \r\nPalestinian people and other States whose territories \r\nhave been occupied by oppressive force. In this regard, \r\nwe feel compelled to cite the note verbale dated 13 July \r\nfrom the Permanent Observer Mission of the State of \r\nPalestine to the United Nations, included in the report \r\nof the Secretary-General on the peaceful settlement of \r\nthe question of Palestine:\r\n‘‘Regrettably, in contrast to the global \r\nwelcome and importance accorded to resolution \r\n2334 (2016), we continue to witness the extremely \r\nhostile reaction of Israel, the occupying Power, to \r\nthe Security Council’s action, and indeed to any \r\nGeneral Assembly action in this regard, including \r\nthe adoption of resolution 72/14. Despite the fact \r\nthat the resolution was adopted in full conformity \r\nand consistency with the Charter of the United \r\nNations, international law, the relevant resolutions \r\nand the long-standing consensus on this matter, \r\nthe Israeli Government has vehemently rejected \r\nit, aggressively pursuing its illegal policies and \r\nmeasures in Occupied Palestine, including East \r\nJerusalem, in blatant contempt of resolutions 2334 \r\n(2016), 72/14 and other core resolutions, in grave \r\nviolation of its legal obligations, including under \r\nArticle 25 of the Charter, and in total contradiction \r\nof the two-State solution, which is dependent on \r\nthe full, immediate cessation and reversal of such \r\nillegal activities.” (A/73/346, p. 3)\r\nIn that regard, the question is why 70 years had to \r\nelapse before the General Assembly adopted resolution \r\n72/14, to which the Secretary-General refers throughout \r\nhis report in document A/73/346, and why the Assembly \r\nhas to continue to discuss the issue. In his report, the \r\nSecretary-General, whom we as Member States elected \r\nto his post and who is a member neither of Fatah nor \r\nHamas, confirms the aggressiveness with which Israel \r\nhas met all General Assembly resolutions, its blatant \r\ncontempt for the Security Council’s resolutions and its \r\ngross violations of the Charter. Why do we continue \r\nto consider this issue if only one entity believes that \r\nmore than 150 Member States are wrong, biased and \r\nopposed to its existence and security? Why does that \r\nentity insist on being a Member of the United Nations \r\nif it believes that the Organization is biased and that \r\nits resolutions are hostile to its existence? The greatest \r\nirony is that the United Nations, which is the institution \r\nthat the entity does not like, is the very institution that \r\nwas responsible for establishing and recognizing it.\r\nWhen we say that the occupying Power is being \r\nprovocative, we are not distorting the truth. After the \r\nIsraeli Prime Minister’s Cabinet took a decision to \r\nallow members of the so-called Israeli Knesset to visit \r\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif, Knesset members took pictures \r\nduring their visit to Al-Aqsa Mosque in violation of \r\nthe media ban on photography. Is that not proof that \r\nthe occupying Power seeks to provoke the Palestinian \r\npeople and transform the political conflict into a \r\nreligious one?\r\nThe oppressive occupying Power has enacted a \r\nJewish nation-State law that provides that the State \r\nconsiders the expanded Jewish settlements, described \r\nas “Jewish settlements”, to be of national value, and that \r\nit will encourage and promote their establishment. The \r\nlaw is applicable in the area known as Israel, as well \r\nas areas that have been annexed since 1967, including \r\nEast Jerusalem. Following the law’s adoption, how can \r\nwe believe that the entity is serious in pursuing peace \r\nor that it could be a genuine partner in a peace process? \r\nHow can we trust that it will respect any borders other \r\nthan those that come down to us from old myths? What \r\nis surprising is that even after enacting the law, we \r\nrepeatedly hear that the entity is the only democracy \r\nin the region. Perhaps its democracy is a privilege that \r\nother nations are not allowed to enjoy.\r\nThe oppressive occupying Power’s use of the \r\ntools of democracy to entrench its occupation became \r\neminently clear when it imposed municipal elections \r\non the occupied Syrian Golan with the sole purpose of \r\nstripping the Syrian people of their Syrian Arab identity, \r\nafter a long period of marginalizing them and depriving \r\nthem of their most basic rights, including potable water \r\nand contact with their families and relatives in their \r\nmotherland of Syria. In that context, we emphasize that \r\nthe occupied Golan is part and parcel of the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, which continues to have sovereignty over it.\r\nIn conclusion, today the international community \r\nshould address the Palestinian question with a sense \r\nof responsibility, not neutrality, because, as members \r\nof the United Nations, we have all historically \r\ncontributed to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian \r\nterritories and left the Palestinians to face the entity \r\nby themselves. In 70 years of occupation, we have \r\n28/11/2018 A/73/PV.42\r\n18-40195 11/24\r\noffered the Palestinians nothing but resolutions and \r\nreports. We firmly believe that today the international \r\ncommunity can choose between two alternatives in \r\nthis context. Either it will work seriously at all levels \r\nto achieve a just and comprehensive peace for both \r\nsides through the strict implementation of the relevant \r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions, \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative and the relevant agreements, \r\nor we publicly tell the Palestinian people, who now \r\nlack have no feelings hope, that the United Nations is \r\nincapable of providing them with any kind of support \r\nor help to achieve their natural and historical right to \r\nestablish a full sovereign State on even a part of their \r\nhistorical territories, some of which they once gave \r\nup for the sake of peace and stability. In that regard, \r\nthe oppressive occupying Power intends to use use its \r\ndeath-and-destruction machine to demolish whatever is \r\nleft of the great Palestinian people and move to control \r\nthe remainder of the Palestinian territories in order to \r\nrealize its dream of establishing the Zionist project \r\nof a Greater Israel, whose borders and shape are yet \r\nunknown. Nevertheless, we want it to be known that \r\nPalestine and its people are here to stay.\r\nMs. Fareena (Maldives): My delegation would like \r\nto express its appreciation for the convening of this \r\nimportant meeting on the question of Palestine, and to \r\nreiterate and renew our full support for and solidarity \r\nwith Palestine and the Palestinian people.\r\nIt is now 71 years to the day since the General \r\nAssembly adopted its historic resolution 181 (II), which \r\nset out the framework for establishing a sovereign and \r\nindependent State of Palestine. The resolution remains \r\nhistoric because of its failure to realize its own promise \r\nof creating two separate, independent States, living \r\nside by side in peace and harmony. It is historic, too, \r\nbecause of its failure to protect the fundamental rights \r\nof Palestinians to live in their homes with dignity and \r\nrespect. The result of that historic failure is there for all \r\nto see in its entirety — decades of oppression, illegal \r\noccupation and the denial of basic human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms to the Palestinian people.\r\nThe International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People, which is taking place today, is an \r\nopportunity for the international community to focus \r\nits attention on the fact that the question of Palestine \r\nis still unresolved and that the Palestinian people have \r\nnot attained their inalienable rights, as defined by the \r\nGeneral Assembly — the right to self-determination \r\nwithout external interference, the right to national \r\nindependence and sovereignty and the right of \r\nPalestinians to return to the homes and property from \r\nwhich they were expelled. We urge the international \r\ncommunity to make every effort to protect those rights.\r\nThe Maldives condemns the continued violations \r\nof human rights and disregard for international law \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories, including East \r\nJerusalem. The Secretary-General notes in his report \r\n(A/73/346) the demolition of homes and the forced \r\neviction of Palestinian families, punitive arrests, unfair \r\ntrials, the torture of detainees and the use of excessive \r\nor lethal force against non-violent demonstrations.\r\nThe Government of the Maldives therefore urges \r\nIsrael to return to the right side of international law, \r\nrestart negotiations with the leadership of the State of \r\nPalestine in good faith and end its seven decades of \r\noccupation. We appeal to Israel to create the conditions \r\nnecessary for the establishment of an independent \r\nand sovereign State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital, on the Palestinian lands within the pre-\r\n1967 borders, living side by side with Israel. That is \r\nthe solution that the resolutions of the Security Council \r\nhave advanced, and it is the only viable one.\r\nThe international community has a special \r\nresponsibility to ensure that the decisions it makes, the \r\nresolutions we adopt in the Assembly, are implemented \r\nin full and in good faith. Obstacles to implementing \r\nsuch resolutions have to be identified and the necessary \r\ninstruments deployed to ensure that the decisions of the \r\nUnited Nations are fully respected by all.\r\nWe have a shared responsibility to sustain peace \r\nand promote fundamental human rights. If we are to \r\nbe able to meet it, we must create an environment of \r\nrespect for the human rights of the Palestinian people, \r\nwhere there are no incitements or provocations and \r\nwhere fundamental freedoms and the people are \r\nsuppressed and oppressed by no one. We can all take \r\nthe very first step of fulfilling that responsibility by \r\ngranting full membership of the United Nations to the \r\nState of Palestine. The Maldives and its people will \r\nalways be with Palestine.\r\nMr. Almunayekh (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nSeventy years have passed since the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 181 (II), concerning the Palestinian \r\nquestion. However, the brotherly Palestinian people \r\ncontinue to suffer from the Israeli occupation of \r\ntheir territories, not to mention the egregious and \r\ngrave violations of international humanitarian \r\nA/73/PV.42 28/11/2018\r\n12/24 18-40195\r\nlaw and international human rights law that have \r\nstripped the Palestinian people of their freedom and a \r\ndignified livelihood.\r\nFor years, numerous international and United \r\nNations resolutions have been adopted with a view to \r\nsupporting the Palestinian people and their aspirations. \r\nUnfortunately, most of them are dead letters. Israel \r\nhas been intransigent in its refusal to implement the \r\nrelevant Security Council and General Assembly \r\nresolutions and shoulder its responsibilities under the \r\nFourth Geneva Convention since the beginning of its \r\noccupation in 1967, nearly 50 years ago. Israel continues \r\nto engage in practices that undermine all United \r\nNations humanitarian and ethical criteria. It is trying \r\nto alter the demographic composition of the Palestinian \r\nterritories by way of forced evictions, confiscations \r\nof land and property and the expansion and building \r\nof settlements; it is also seeking to change Palestine’s \r\ncurrent, historical status and prevent Muslims from \r\npracticing their legitimate rights and religious rituals.\r\nSince the Great March of Return in March, the \r\nPalestinian people have been facing the most heinous \r\nforms of human rights violations as Israel targets \r\ncivilians with live ammunition, claiming the lives of \r\nhundreds of innocent martyrs, scores of whom are \r\nchildren. Thousands are suffering permanent disability \r\nand enduring rigid restrictions on the mobility of \r\npersons and goods that are designed only to tighten \r\nthe grip that Israel has had on the Gaza Strip since \r\n2007 and undermine any prospects for a two-State \r\nsolution. In that regard, we stress the importance of \r\nthe implementation of Security Council resolution \r\n2334 (2016), which condemns all Israeli practices of \r\nexpanding and building settlements, seizing lands, \r\ndemolishing homes and displacing Palestinians.\r\nMy country is steadfast in its defence of the rights \r\nof the Palestinian people, a position that is a mainstay \r\nof the external policy of the State of Kuwait. We \r\nsupport all international efforts to reach a just and \r\ncomprehensive solution to the Palestinian question \r\nbased on the Arab Peace Initiative, international law \r\nand resolutions of international legitimacy. We welcome \r\nthe French initiative to convene an international \r\npeace conference leading to the establishment of a \r\nmultilateral international mechanism that would pave \r\nthe way to ending all illegitimate settlement activities \r\nand eventually terminate the Israeli occupation of the \r\nState of Palestine once and for all, according to specific \r\ncriteria that would guarantee the right of the Palestinian \r\npeople to self-determination and the establishment \r\nof their independent State based on the 4 June 1967 \r\nborders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nThrough our membership in the Security Council, \r\nwe will continue to defend the legitimate rights of \r\nthe Palestinian people, work to enable the Council to \r\nshoulder its responsibility to champion the Palestinian \r\npeople, support their just cause, compel Israel to end \r\nits gross violations of international humanitarian law \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories and to implement \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, and achieve a \r\njust and lasting peace leading to a two-State solution.\r\nWe celebrate the International Day of Solidarity \r\nwith the Palestinian People, a disarmed people who still \r\nsuffer from occupation and remain deprived of their \r\nfundamental right to a dignified life. I would like to \r\nconclude with the following thoughts.\r\nFirst, we hail the determination and struggle of the \r\nPalestinian people. We assert our steadfast commitment \r\nto supporting them in order to attain all their legitimate \r\npolitical rights and establish their independent State on \r\ntheir land, with East Jerusalem as its capital, as well \r\nas to setting a time frame to end the Israeli occupation \r\nof the Palestinian territories in accordance with \r\ninternational regulations and laws.\r\nSecondly, we continue to denounce the ongoing \r\nillegal and inhumane blockade of Gaza, which is yet \r\nanother violation by Israel of Security Council resolution \r\n1860 (2009) and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. \r\nWe call for that blockade to be ended immediately.\r\nThirdly, we call on the international community, \r\nthrough the organs of the United Nations and the \r\nSecurity Council in particular, to provide the disarmed \r\nPalestinian people with international protection against \r\nthe Israeli military machine and to end the occupation \r\nas soon as possible. We also urge the international \r\ncommunity to extend its essential support to the United \r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees \r\nin the Near East, given its important role in mitigating \r\nthe suffering of the brotherly Palestinian people.\r\nFourthly, we reiterate our call to all parties, \r\nespecially those that sponsor the peace process in \r\nthe Middle East, to intensify their efforts and exert \r\npressure on Israel to accept and uphold the resolutions \r\nof the United Nations. In that regard, we call on the \r\nUnited Nations and all its entities to take on their \r\nresponsibilities regarding the Palestinian question until \r\n28/11/2018 A/73/PV.42\r\n18-40195 13/24\r\na just, comprehensive and lasting solution is reached on \r\nall the relevant issues, including that of refugees.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Argentina would like to make a statement \r\nwith regard to the situation in the Middle East and \r\nthe question of Palestine, agenda items 38 and 39, \r\nrespectively, which my country has been following with \r\nconcern. Argentina reaffirms its support for a peaceful, \r\nlasting and comprehensive solution to the question of \r\nPalestine, based on a two-State solution within the 1967 \r\nborders, in addition to whatever else the parties may \r\ndecide during the peace negotiation process.\r\nTwenty-five years after the signing of the Oslo \r\nAccords, the Palestinian-Israeli peace process is \r\nencountering its most difficult moment ever. At this \r\nparticular juncture, Argentina reaffirms its support for \r\nall efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region. \r\nWe encourage regional actors and partner countries \r\nof Israel and Palestine to work constructively to help \r\nthe parties advance towards a peaceful settlement of \r\ntheir differences with a view to resuming negotiations \r\non all final status issues identified in the Oslo \r\nAccords — Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, borders \r\nand security measures.\r\nThe seriousness of the situation on the ground calls \r\nfor a collective effort if the prospect of a two-State \r\nsolution is to be kept alive, as established in the relevant \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, the Quartet road map for peace and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative. Argentina reaffirms its support for \r\nthe inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-\r\ndetermination and to establish an independent and \r\nviable State that is recognized by all nations, as well as \r\nfor Israel’s right to live in peace alongside its neighbours \r\nand within safe and internationally recognized borders.\r\nArgentina also reiterates its concern about the \r\npersistent and continuing growth of illegal Israeli \r\nsettlements in occupied Palestinian territory and calls \r\nfor that expansion to cease. As has been pointed out \r\nmany times in the General Assembly, settlements \r\nare contrary to international law and an obstacle to \r\npeace. They weaken the prospects for both States to \r\nlive in peace and security and therefore promote the \r\nperpetuation of an unsustainable status quo. The \r\ngravity of the situation has been recognized by the \r\nSecurity Council in its resolution 2334 (2016), whose \r\nterms we fully affirm.\r\nAt the same time, attacks on Israeli citizens are \r\ntotally unacceptable and must stop immediately. My \r\ncountry condemns all terrorist acts in the strongest \r\npossible terms, as well as the hostile actions of Hamas \r\nand other Palestinian organizations, including the \r\nlaunching of missiles from the Gaza Strip into Israeli \r\nterritory. In that context, we recognize the right of Israel \r\nto exercise its legitimate right to self-defence. However, \r\nwe also want to assert that all actions taken by Israel \r\nin accordance with that right should be compatible \r\nwith international humanitarian law, keeping in mind \r\nthe principles of distinction between civilians and \r\ncombatants, proportionality and the military necessity \r\nfor the use of force, among other things.\r\nWe call on Palestinian organizations that have yet \r\nto recognize Israel to renounce the use of violence and \r\nrespect the existing agreements. We acknowledge the \r\npositive role played by Egypt and the United Nations \r\nin the ceasefire agreement of 13 November, and we \r\nencourage all actors involved in Gaza to refrain from \r\ntaking steps that could jeopardize the sustainability of \r\nthat agreement.\r\nIn the light of the financial difficulties being \r\nexperienced by the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, \r\nArgentina reaffirms its full support for the Agency’s \r\nwork and recognizes the need for the international \r\ncommunity to come up with an appropriate response \r\nto ensure the provision of the funds needed to avoid the \r\ninterruption of its services.\r\nWith regard to the situation in East Jerusalem, \r\nArgentina reaffirms the special status of Jerusalem, \r\nbased on the relevant United Nations resolutions, \r\nincluding Security Council resolution 478 (1980), and \r\nin that regard rejects any unilateral attempt to modify \r\nit, particularly with regard to the Old City of Jerusalem, \r\nwhich has a special significance for the three major \r\nmonotheistic religions. We believe that the Holy City \r\nshould be a place of coming together and peace, and \r\nthat free access to the holy sites must be guaranteed \r\nfor Jews, Muslims and Christians alike. Any attempt \r\nto deny or relativize the historical connection and \r\nprofound meaning of those places to the three \r\nmonotheistic religions is completely unacceptable, does \r\nnot contribute to the goal of finding a peaceful solution \r\nto the conflict and reinforces prejudices and mistrust \r\nbetween the parties. Argentina believes that Jerusalem \r\nis one of the final status issues that must be agreed on \r\nby the parties through bilateral negotiations.\r\nA/73/PV.42 28/11/2018\r\n14/24 18-40195\r\nWith regard to the Syrian Golan, Argentina \r\nmaintains a principled position on the illegal acquisition \r\nof territories by force and respect for the territorial \r\nintegrity of States. We firmly believe in the principle \r\nof the peaceful settlement of disputes and therefore \r\nconsider it important to seek a negotiated solution to \r\nthe conflict between Syria and Israel with a view to \r\nputting an end to the occupation of the Golan Heights as \r\nsoon as possible, in accordance with Security Council \r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle \r\nof land for peace.\r\nIn conclusion, Argentina once again urges the \r\nPalestinians and Israelis to resume peace talks and act \r\nin good faith, with f lexibility and in accordance with \r\ninternational law, in seeking to reach an agreement on \r\nthe outstanding issues concerning the final status of \r\nPalestine in all of its aspects.\r\nMr. Alshamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I am pleased to be able to thank \r\nyou, Madam President, for presiding over this meeting \r\nand to express my country’s appreciation for the \r\nimportant activities of the Committee on the Exercise \r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.\r\nI want to reaffirm that the Palestinian question and \r\nthe Middle East peace process remain important and \r\ncentral issues for my country, the region and the world. \r\nThat is in line with a letter sent by His Highness Sheikh \r\nKhalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United \r\nArab Emirates, to the Chairman of the Committee \r\non the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the \r\nPalestinian People in observance of the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. To that \r\nend, the United Arab Emirates would like to express \r\nits continued support for international efforts aimed \r\nat enabling the Palestinian people to enjoy their \r\nlegitimate and inalienable right to end the occupation \r\nand establish an independent Palestinian State within \r\nthe 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in \r\naccordance with the relevant international resolutions \r\nand the Arab Peace Initiative, which is considered \r\nan important point of reference for a solution to the \r\nPalestinian question.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates therefore calls on the \r\ninternational community to shoulder its responsibilities, \r\nin accordance with international law and the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, to put an end to the suffering of the \r\nPalestinian people and to take all necessary measures \r\nto end the Israeli occupation of all Palestinian and Arab \r\nterritories. In that regard, we stress the importance \r\nof not allowing any party to undermine the serious \r\ncollective efforts made to achieve peace and stability. \r\nIf we allow that to happen, we will be managing crises \r\nrather than resolving them. We commend regional \r\nand international initiatives aimed at advancing the \r\nMiddle East peace process, including the efforts of the \r\nArab Republic of Egypt to achieve inter-Palestinian \r\nreconciliation and restore calm.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates condemns Israel’s \r\nongoing aggressive actions against the Palestinian \r\npeople. We demand that it end all actions that violate \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and international law. \r\nIsrael’s continued illegitimate practices, notably \r\nits promulgation of a Jewish nation-State law and \r\nits construction and expansion of settlements on \r\nPalestinian territories, will undoubtedly undermine \r\nthe political efforts to reach a two-State solution and \r\nconstitute a major obstacle to efforts to achieve peace.\r\nAs we work to achieve a just and lasting peace for \r\nthe Palestinian people, we cannot ignore the exacerbated \r\nand deteriorating humanitarian and economic situation \r\nin the Palestinian territories, which are in dire need of \r\nenhanced humanitarian and development assistance. \r\nWe therefore once again call on the international \r\ncommunity and donors to increase their contributions \r\nto the Palestinian people in order to enable them \r\nto confront their crisis and achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, like all other nations.\r\nGiven my country’s historical commitment to \r\nsupporting our brotherly Palestinian people in the \r\ndevelopment, humanitarian, education and social \r\nsectors, the United Arab Emirates contributed \r\napproximately $173 million to the Palestinian people \r\nin 2017 and 2018. Moreover, with regard to the United \r\nArab Emirates’ foreign aid policies and priorities, \r\nincluding the right of children to an education and \r\nthe empowerment of women and teacher training, we \r\nhave directed more than $65 million of that amount \r\nto the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East in order to support \r\nits educational programmes and the other vital services \r\nthat it provides in the health and food sectors.\r\nIn conclusion, we reaffirm that achieving security \r\nand stability in the region requires finding political \r\nsolutions to prolonged crises. That also means \r\nredoubling our efforts to combat extremism and \r\nterrorism all over the world, particularly given that \r\n28/11/2018 A/73/PV.42\r\n18-40195 15/24\r\nextremist and terrorist groups take advantage of crises \r\nto further spread violence, chaos and destruction while \r\ngetting support and funds from certain regional parties.\r\nMr. Moncada (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): Today the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations celebrate the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, which provides \r\nan opportunity to continue our efforts to raise awareness \r\nwithin the international community with a view to \r\nachieving a just, comprehensive and lasting solution to \r\nthe question of Palestine.\r\nMore than 70 years after the Nakba, and after 50 \r\nyears of occupation and 25 years after the signing of the \r\nOslo Accords, we continue to support the Palestinian \r\npeople’s inalienable rights, including their right to \r\nself-determination, through the establishment an \r\nindependent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital. That is why we call for a just solution to the \r\nplight of the Palestinian refugees, in accordance with \r\nresolution 194 (III).\r\nWe denounce the ongoing violations being \r\nperpetrated by Israel, the occupying Power, in occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including attempts to alter the \r\nnature, status and demographic composition of the city \r\nof Jerusalem, particularly through the recognition of \r\nJerusalem as the capital of Israel. In that regard, we \r\nreject any measure seeking to alter the city’s status as a \r\ncorpus separatum, which is a violation of international \r\nlaw, including the relevant resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly.\r\nWe regret the upsurge in violence and insecurity \r\nin the Gaza Strip and the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories, and we call for an end to the illegal policies \r\nof settlement, demolition, displacement, arbitrary \r\ndetention and restriction of the freedom of movement \r\nwithin the territories. We call on Israel to end its \r\npolicy of military incursion, which affects the civilian \r\npopulation and continues to have many victims.\r\nWe recognize the efforts of the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in \r\nthe Near East (UNRWA) to improve its effectiveness \r\nand the quality of its services in a context of financial \r\ndeprivation, with a view to continuing to promote \r\nthe human rights of Palestinian refugees. The United \r\nNations must guarantee a budget adequate to the proper \r\nfunctioning of UNRWA so as to enable it to continue to \r\ncarry out its humanitarian mission.\r\nAt the same time, we appreciate the work of the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People and support it in the fulfilment \r\nof its mission. We urge the Department of Public \r\nInformation to do a more effective job of providing \r\ninformation on the Palestinian question, and we \r\ncommend the efforts of United Nations officials to \r\ncarry out their humanitarian work during the conflict.\r\nVenezuela supports the request by the Government \r\nof the State of Palestine for the establishment of a \r\nsystem of international protection for the Palestinian \r\npopulation in the occupied territory, in accordance \r\nwith the Fourth Geneva Convention and resolution 904 \r\n(1994), in the light of the ongoing acts of aggression in \r\nthe West Bank, including East Jerusalem and Gaza, by \r\nthe occupying Power, which remains unwilling to meet \r\nits responsibility to ensure the protection of Palestinians, \r\nin accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention.\r\nFinally, we reiterate our support for a just, lasting \r\nand peaceful solution to the Palestinian question, based \r\non a two-State solution along the pre-1967 borders and \r\nwith East Jerusalem as capital of an independent State \r\nof Palestine, with full United Nations membership and \r\nin peaceful coexistence with Israel within defined and \r\nrecognized borders, in accordance with all the relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): At the outset, I would like to \r\nexpress my delegation’s gratitude to the Committee on \r\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople for its important work and comprehensive report \r\n(А/73/35).\r\nSeventy-one years ago today, the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 181 (II) , which envisaged a two-\r\nState arrangement. Since then, the tragedy of Palestine \r\nhas only intensified, and it remains an unremitting tale \r\nof broken promises and unfulfilled rights. As the dark \r\nshadows of occupation and oppression have lengthened \r\nover time, they have not only betrayed the hopes and \r\naspirations of generations of Palestinians, they have \r\nalso sown the seeds of endless hostility and discord in \r\nthe Middle East.\r\nToday many warn that the entire region could \r\nplunge into a fresh vortex of violence. That is a sobering \r\nassessment that portends fresh pain and suffering for \r\nthe people of Palestine. After all, a conflict that pits \r\nan occupying Power against an occupied people and \r\nin which one side is armed with guns and modern \r\nweaponry and the other with only an abiding conviction \r\nA/73/PV.42 28/11/2018\r\n16/24 18-40195\r\nin the rightness of its cause, is by its very nature a \r\ntravesty of justice and all norms of international law, \r\nfor it seeks to legitimize the strength of might over the \r\npower of right.\r\nThe question of Palestine is a test of our \r\ncommitment to the abiding principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, based on the inherent dignity \r\nof the individual and on respect for the fundamental \r\nhuman rights of all human beings, including their right \r\nto self-determination. The tragedy of Palestine is our \r\ncollective failure to uphold those fundamental ideals as \r\nmembers of the international community.\r\nThis year, as we mark the twenty-fifth anniversary \r\nof the Oslo Accords, the fundamental principles of a \r\ntwo-State solution continue to be systematically eroded \r\nand dismantled. Unfortunately, the world seems to have \r\ngrown so accustomed to the disastrous events in the \r\noccupied territories that failure to reach a peace deal \r\nhas become the new normal. But I want to remind this \r\nparliament of the world that there is nothing normal \r\nabout the hardship, pain and suffering that the people \r\nof Palestine face every day. These are people who are \r\nfast losing the few lingering remnants of hope that they \r\nmay have. That sense of frustration and despondency \r\nhas worsened because of an unfortunate succession of \r\nevents, a few of which I shall point to now.\r\nFirst and most obviously, long-standing resolutions \r\nof the Security Council and the General Assembly \r\non the status of Jerusalem are being f louted with \r\ncontempt. The decision of some countries to relocate \r\ntheir embassies to Jerusalem, despite the Assembly’s \r\nalmost unanimous decision disallowing it, has further \r\ninflamed the volatile situation. Secondly, the illegal \r\nexpansion of Israeli settlements into the occupied \r\nterritory continues unabated. Thirdly, in Gaza the \r\nillegal blockade suffocating the life of a once-thriving \r\ncommunity continues into its eleventh year. Fourthly, \r\nplans to demolish the Bedouin community of Khan \r\nAl-Ahmar have yet again exposed Israel’s longstanding \r\npolicy of forcibly displacing Palestinians from their \r\nlands. They strike at the heart of Palestinians’ identity \r\nand their very existence as a people. Fifthly, the decision \r\nof a major donor to cease all financial support to the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East undermines the long-term \r\nsustainability of the Agency’s activities, which support \r\nmore than 5 million Palestinian refugees. Finally, we \r\nare now witnessing attempts to deflect the attention \r\nof the international community by bringing a draft \r\nresolution to the General Assembly that does nothing \r\nto pave the way for peace. We join other Member States \r\nin categorically rejecting this move and by extension \r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nWe all know what the contours of a resolution of \r\nthis long-standing conflict would look like. They are \r\na comprehensive and peaceful settlement, ending the \r\noccupation, the realization of the inalienable rights of \r\nthe Palestinian people, including to self-determination \r\nand independence, and the achievement of a two-State \r\nsolution. A viable, independent and contiguous State \r\nof Palestine, on the basis of the internationally agreed \r\nparameters of the pre-1967 borders, and with Al-Quds \r\nAl-Sharif as its capital, is the only sustainable guarantee \r\nof enduring peace in the Middle East. There is no \r\nalternative. The role of the Security Council remains \r\ncritical to that end. The Council will only enhance its \r\nown credibility by ensuring the full and comprehensive \r\nimplementation of its long-standing resolutions.\r\nThe Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan \r\nrepresents another critical dimension of the Middle \r\nEast conflict. Israel’s policy of exercising illegal \r\ncontrol over resources and altering the demographic \r\ncomposition and legal status of the occupied Syrian \r\nGolan blatantly disregards various General Assembly \r\nand Security Council resolutions. The withdrawal of \r\noccupation forces from all Arab lands, including from \r\nLebanon and the Syrian Golan, is vital to durable peace \r\nand security.\r\nIn conclusion, as we all know, the suffering of the \r\npeople of Palestine is as old as the United Nations itself. \r\nIt is time to bring an end to this tragedy. It is time to \r\nreinvigorate hopes of peace and mutual coexistence for \r\nthe entire region. While the Palestinians continue to \r\nsuffer and their homeland vanishes before our eyes, the \r\ninternational community should not remain silent any \r\nlonger. For its part, Pakistan remains unstinting and \r\nsteadfast in its commitment to the cause of Palestine.\r\nMr. Alrowaiei (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nWe thank the Chairman of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, His Excellency Mr. Cheikh Niang, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Senegal, and the members of the \r\nCommittee for their report, contained in document \r\nA/73/35, and for their efforts to enable the Palestinian \r\npeople to enjoy their inalienable rights, like other \r\npeoples of the world.\r\n28/11/2018 A/73/PV.42\r\n18-40195 17/24\r\nThe Palestinian question remains unresolved after \r\n70 years, despite the adoption of many Security Council \r\nand General Assembly resolutions on the issue. Peace \r\nin the Middle East is still basically dependent on the \r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State and \r\nthe return of Palestinian refugees. In that context, we \r\nnote that the report of the Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People calls on \r\nthe occupying Power to protect civilians who are under \r\nits control, in accordance with international law, and \r\nfor an end to the illegal blockade of the Gaza Strip.\r\nIn a letter addressed to the Committee on the \r\noccasion of the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People, Shaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al \r\nKhalifa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain, reaffirmed Bahrain’s steadfast position \r\nwith regard to the Palestinian question. In that letter, \r\nhe stated that\r\n“the Kingdom of Bahrain headed by His Majesty \r\nKing Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa reiterates the \r\ninalienable and historic rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople, most notably their right to establish their \r\nindependent State with East Jerusalem as its capital \r\nalong the borders of 4 June 1967. This must be in \r\nline with the two-State solution and the relevant \r\ninternational resolutions, as well as the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative.”\r\nWe want to once again recall our collective \r\nresponsibility as an international community to the \r\nPalestinian people, and our responsibility to ensure that \r\ntheir just cause is resolved, especially in the light of the \r\nunprecedented scale of their long-standing suffering, \r\nwhich requires us to stand by them. If it continues, it \r\nwill seriously threaten peace and stability not only in \r\nthe Middle East but also throughout the entire world.\r\nThe deterioration of the situation in the occupied \r\nterritories and Israel’s rejected policies — including \r\nforced displacement, the unjustified, excessive use of \r\nforce, land confiscation, illegal settlement construction \r\nand other dangerous practices — constitute gross \r\nviolations of the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1949 \r\nGeneva Conventions. The international community must \r\ntherefore put pressure on Israel to end those practices \r\nimmediately and implement international resolutions.\r\nI commend the efforts of the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in \r\nthe Near East (UNRWA), which provides education \r\nand basic services and has always contributed to the \r\nimprovement of the living conditions of Palestinian \r\nrefugees. We reaffirm the importance of providing \r\nsupport to UNRWA so that it can perform its duties to \r\nthe best of its abilities.\r\nIn conclusion, any settlement of the Palestinian-\r\nIsraeli conflict requires basic solutions such as those \r\ncontained in the Arab Peace Initiative. The Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain calls on the international community to \r\nstep up its efforts to ensure that the Palestinian people \r\ncan exercise their inalienable rights, the Palestinian \r\nrefugees can return home, and a lasting and just peace \r\ncan be achieved in accordance with the relevant United \r\nNations resolutions, including those of the Security \r\nCouncil on a two-State solution, which would enable all \r\nthe peoples of the region to live in peace and stability.\r\nMs. Mudallali (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): First \r\nand foremost, I would like to thank the Ambassador \r\nof Senegal, Chair of the Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, for \r\nhis efforts. I also want to thank all the members of the \r\nCommittee for their support to the Palestinian people.\r\nAs we do every year, we are meeting today to \r\nconsider the Palestinian question and reaffirm the fact \r\nthat the Palestinian people have inalienable and lasting \r\nrights, including the right to exist, to live and to build a \r\nState on their own territory. We must therefore fulfil our \r\nresponsibilities regarding this matter, which dates back \r\nmore than seven decades and is now an issue for the \r\nentire international community. The Palestinian people \r\nhave the right to restore peace to the city of peace.\r\nDecades have passed and Palestine is still on our \r\nagenda, without a solution or prospect for a solution \r\ndespite dozens of international resolutions, initiatives \r\nand negotiations.\r\nLebanon values the efforts of the United Nations to \r\nrealize the rights of the Palestinian people. We agree with \r\nyou, Madam President, that there is a need today more \r\nthan ever to express our solidarity with the Palestinian \r\npeople. Lebanon underscores its commitment to \r\nsupporting and assisting the Palestinian people in \r\nenjoying their right to freedom and self-determination, \r\nbecause the current phase of the Palestinian question is \r\nthe most dangerous since the start of the conflict.\r\nEveryone is aware that the situation in the Middle \r\nEast, and particularly in Palestine, is deplorable. \r\nPeace remains out of reach, while an entire people are \r\nA/73/PV.42 28/11/2018\r\n18/24 18-40195\r\nsuffering daily under the yoke of occupation and as a \r\nresult of international variables that reinforce dangerous \r\ntrends. Both the Palestinian and the Arab sides see \r\nthat the foundations of peace are being systematically \r\nundermined. Those foundations have been unanimously \r\nand internationally recognized in this Hall since the \r\nadoption of resolution 181 (II), which called for the \r\ncreation of a Palestinian State, and of resolution 3236 \r\n(XXIX), which called for self-determination for the \r\nPalestinian people, as well as dozens of resolutions \r\ncalling on Israel to withdraw from the occupied Arab \r\nterritories to the line of 4 June 1967, including Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which \r\nalso called for an end to the construction of settlements, \r\nwhich runs counter to international legitimacy and \r\ninternational law.\r\nAll those resolutions constitute the legal and \r\nlegitimate basis of a political solution to the conflict. \r\nThey provide the grounds for a just, comprehensive \r\nand lasting solution that can guarantee peace for all the \r\npeoples of the region. They are currently dealt with as \r\ndead letters. Those resolutions have been effectively \r\nerased through denial and failure to recognize people’s \r\nlegitimate rights, as well as by attempts to abrogate \r\nthem completely, which increase the sense of frustration \r\nand despair. This is all happening while the situation on \r\nthe ground is deteriorating and unilateral measures and \r\npolicies are being adopted in an attempt to nullify the \r\nfinal status issues that clearly contravenes international \r\nlegitimacy. Certain States have recognized Jerusalem \r\nas the capital of Israel and moved their embassies to \r\nJerusalem, which threatens any remaining hopes for \r\npeace, since Jerusalem is one of the most important \r\nfinal status issues.\r\nAttempts to end assistance to the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in \r\nthe Near East and its funding are cruel moves that \r\njeopardize the lives and future of the refugees. What \r\nis needed is the provision of support to an agency \r\nthat ensures humanitarian, educational and medical \r\nservices to millions of Palestinian refugees. The \r\nsettlements, which are considered illegal under dozens \r\nof international resolutions and constitute an obstacle \r\nto achieving peace, are growing faster than ever. They \r\ncontinue to cut off the occupied Palestinian territories \r\nand threaten the dream of the Palestinian people to \r\nachieve an independent State with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital.\r\nGaza, an enormous prison for nearly 2 million \r\npeople, has endured dire humanitarian conditions \r\nduring 12 years of siege. The situation there threatens \r\nto explode at any time. Ninety-five per cent of the water \r\nin Gaza is undrinkable, the unemployment rate is the \r\nhighest in the world, and the inhabitants of Gaza are \r\nbeing attacked and shot with live Israeli ammunition, \r\nleaving hundreds killed and thousands of civilian \r\ndemonstrators injured. All of that makes it more than \r\never incumbent on us to return to the path of peace and \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative and to implement the relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions.\r\nThe Arab countries expressed their position at \r\nthe Arab Summit Conference in Beirut in 2002. They \r\nchose a path of peace for all peoples of the region as a \r\nstrategic choice. They called on Israel to declare that \r\npeace is its strategic choice as well. The Arab Peace \r\nInitiative provided a simple and fair equation. It calls for \r\na complete withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab \r\nterritories to the line of 4 June 1967, the establishment \r\nof a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nan agreed, just solution to the issue of refugees in order \r\nto put an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the \r\nachievement of a peace agreement with Israel while \r\nensuring peace for all peoples of the region, and the \r\nestablishment of normal relations with Israel as part of \r\na comprehensive peace.\r\nSixteen years have passed since the adoption of \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative and Israel has not made a \r\nstrategic choice for peace. It is still using force as if that \r\nwill achieve peace and security. Let us address the root \r\ncauses of that conflict rather than wasting time simply \r\non new means of avoiding the truth that the current \r\nsituation cannot continue and is not viable. As Martin \r\nLuther King said, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to \r\njustice everywhere”.\r\nMr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nPalestinian question lies at the root of the situation in \r\nthe Middle East and affects the long-term stability, \r\nprosperity and development of the countries of the \r\nregion. Finding a comprehensive and just solution to the \r\nPalestinian question as soon as possible is an aspiration \r\nwe all share that is in the interests of the Palestinian \r\npeople and the peoples of the region and will contribute \r\nto world peace and stability.\r\nAt present, relations between Palestine and Israel \r\nremains tense and fragile, and developments in the \r\nsituation are worrisome. Settlement construction and the \r\n28/11/2018 A/73/PV.42\r\n18-40195 19/24\r\ndemolition of Palestinian homes continue unabated and \r\npose a threat to the realization of a two-State solution. \r\nThe precarious humanitarian and security situation in \r\nthe Gaza Strip, including many civilian casualties, is \r\ndetrimental to regional peace and the peace process. \r\nViolence cannot be eradicated with more violence. The \r\nrelevant parties should exercise restraint in order to \r\navoid further escalation.\r\nThe General Assembly resolutions on the protection \r\nof Palestinian civilians should be fully implemented. \r\nThe parties concerned should lift the blockade on \r\nGaza as soon as possible. The international community \r\nshould redouble its support to the United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \r\nEast, take a long-term perspective and jointly bring the \r\nPalestinian question back to the quest for a negotiated \r\nsolution.\r\nFirst, a two-State solution is the only way to resolve \r\nthe Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The international \r\ncommunity should remain committed to working on \r\nthe basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions, the \r\nprinciple of land for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative, \r\nand to finding a comprehensive, just and lasting solution \r\nto the Palestinian question through negotiation. All \r\nthe relevant parties should fully implement Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2334 (2016), immediately cease all \r\nsettlement activities in the occupied territories and take \r\nmeasures to prevent violence against civilians.\r\nSecondly, the international community should \r\nremain united, bring a heightened sense of urgency \r\nand responsibility to the issue and launch a new round \r\nof peace efforts. All sides should work towards the \r\nsame goal, refrain from any action or rhetoric that \r\ncould aggravate the situation and avoid taking any \r\nunilateral measures that undermine trust in order \r\nto create the conditions necessary for a resumption \r\nof dialogue. Parties that have major influence in the \r\nMiddle East should play a constructive role, explore \r\nnew mechanisms for mediation and break the current \r\nimpasse in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.\r\nThirdly, the final status of Jerusalem is key to \r\nadvancing the Middle East peace process. This issue \r\nis complex and sensitive and bears on the future of a \r\ntwo-State solution, as well as on regional peace and \r\ntranquillity. All parties should exercise caution when \r\ndealing with related issues, avoid imposing solutions \r\nthat could trigger new confrontations and strive to \r\nreach a balanced solution through negotiations based \r\non the relevant General Assembly and Security Council \r\nresolutions and international consensus.\r\nAt present, the hot-spot issues in the Middle \r\nEast are complicated and intertwined. Conflict and \r\nconfrontation continue and developments on the ground \r\nare worrying. We should focus on peace, impartiality, \r\nconstructiveness and inclusiveness as the way to deal \r\nwith hot-spot issues in the Middle East.\r\nFirst, we should keep searching for a political \r\nsolution, promote dialogue and negotiation and avoid \r\na vicious cycle of violence. Secondly, we must adhere \r\nto the principle of fairness and not extract compromise \r\nby coercion, turning stability into lasting peace rather \r\nthan a mere break in the turbulence. Thirdly, we must \r\nbring the situation under constructive control, take its \r\nhistory and reality into account and gradually foster \r\na general atmosphere in which chaos is contained. \r\nFourthly, we should accommodate the legitimate rights \r\nand interests of all parties, avoid engaging in exclusive \r\narrangements and instead build an open and stable \r\nregional framework for peace.\r\nChina is a good friend and partner of the Palestinian \r\npeople and a staunch backer of peace between Palestine \r\nand Israel. We firmly support and promote the Middle \r\nEast peace process and the just cause of the Palestinian \r\npeople in restoring their legitimate national rights by \r\nestablishing an independent Palestinian State, with full \r\nsovereignty, based on the 1967 borders and with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital. We also support the integration \r\nof the State of Palestine into the international community.\r\nYesterday President Xi Jinping of China sent a \r\nspecial congratulatory message to commemorate the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople and to express his support for Palestine. China \r\nwill follow President Xi’s four-point proposal to promote \r\na political settlement of the Palestinian issue and will \r\ncontinue to work with the international community to \r\nplay a positive and constructive role in achieving peace \r\nin the Middle East.\r\nMr. Hattrem (Norway): Norway has been a \r\nconsistent partner in the promotion of peace and security \r\nin the Middle East for decades. Our commitment to \r\nhelping to achieve a negotiated two-State solution is \r\nfirm. A comprehensive resolution that addresses the \r\nfinal status issues and the aspirations of both peoples \r\nis long overdue. Only a two-State solution can provide \r\ndurable peace and security for both parties.\r\nA/73/PV.42 28/11/2018\r\n20/24 18-40195\r\nWe are deeply concerned about the fragile situation \r\nin and around Gaza. The period from 11 to 13 November \r\nsaw one of the fiercest exchanges of fire in Gaza since \r\nthe 2014 conflict. All parties must work to prevent a \r\nfurther escalation of violence and make a serious effort \r\nto stabilize the situation.\r\nIn New York on 27 September, Norway chaired a \r\nministerial meeting of the international donor group \r\nto Palestine, the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for \r\nthe Coordination of the International Assistance to \r\nPalestinians. The participants welcomed the United \r\nNations humanitarian package for Gaza and called for its \r\nimplementation as a matter of urgency, in coordination \r\nwith the Palestinian Authority. Norway supports these \r\nefforts and is providing additional assistance to the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMs. Bassols Delgado (Spain), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe Ad Hoc Liaison Committee meeting also called \r\nfor urgent action to mitigate the damage to the Palestinian \r\neconomy. A combination of major reductions in donor \r\ncontributions, significant revenue losses due to fiscal \r\nleakages and continued restrictions on Palestinian \r\naccess and movement has led to a serious decline in the \r\nPalestinian economy in 2018. There is a risk of further \r\ndeterioration next year unless the outstanding fiscal \r\nissues between the parties are addressed.\r\nGaza is facing severe economic, humanitarian and \r\nsocial challenges. Ensuring the unimpeded provision of \r\nhumanitarian assistance is important for its population \r\nand for regional stability. There is an urgent need for \r\nimproved access to clean water and energy, job creation \r\nand increased movement of people and goods in and out \r\nof Gaza. We welcome the resumption of the delivery \r\nof fuel to Gaza’s power plant since October, which \r\nhas significantly increased the electricity available to \r\nthe population.\r\nHamas bears a major share of the responsibility for \r\nthe dire situation in Gaza. It is the Palestinian Authority \r\nand the international community, not Hamas, that are \r\nproviding assistance to the people of Gaza. We support \r\nthe Egyptian commitment to facilitating Palestinian \r\nreconciliation, as well as the Palestinian Authority’s \r\nefforts to restore its governance in Gaza and reunite \r\nPalestine under one legitimate authority. But regardless \r\nof that, it is counterproductive to stop supporting \r\nGaza financially, which would further impoverish the \r\npopulation. For its part, Israel must lift its extensive \r\nrestrictions on the movement of people and goods in \r\nand out of Gaza.\r\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains \r\nindispensable to the most vulnerable Palestinian \r\nrefugees, providing essential services and contributing \r\nto regional stability. Donors must remain committed to \r\nsupporting UNRWA, especially when the organization \r\nis facing a very challenging period financially.\r\nRecent developments in East Jerusalem and the \r\nWest Bank, including the decision to demolish the \r\nvillage of Khan Al-Ahmar, are of great concern. We \r\nwelcome the announcement by Israel on 21 October \r\nthat it will delay the demolition of Khan Al-Ahmar. \r\nIts location is strategically important to preserving the \r\ncontiguity of a future Palestinian State.\r\nMr. Bahr Aluloom (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the President for \r\nguiding this meeting, and to express my gratitude \r\nto the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People, represented by its \r\nChair and members, for its report (A/73/35) and their \r\ntireless efforts to defend the rights of our brother \r\nPalestinian people.\r\nOn this International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People, His Excellency the President of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq, Mr. Barham Salih, has sent a letter \r\nto the Chair of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, which I \r\nwill now read out.\r\n“I greet the General Assembly, on behalf of \r\nIraq, on the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People, that steadfast and adamant \r\npeople who have great hopes for peace and the \r\nfuture despite the oppression and injustice they \r\nhave faced, including the deprivation of their most \r\nbasic rights, and in particular their legitimate right \r\nto live in dignity and peace in an independent State \r\non their land, a State that expresses their national \r\nidentity and their political and human aspirations.\r\n“On behalf of the Iraqi people, we reiterate \r\nour solidarity with this fraternal people. We also \r\nunderscore our steadfast determination to ensure \r\nthat the world recognizes the historical importance \r\nof this annual celebration, which coincides with the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s adoption in 1947 of resolution \r\n181 (II). That resolution, on the partition of Palestine, \r\n28/11/2018 A/73/PV.42\r\n18-40195 21/24\r\nrecognizes the responsibility of the United Nations \r\nfor the oppression and damage that have now been \r\nsustained by the Palestinian people for nearly 71 \r\nyears. It also constitutes legal recognition of the just \r\ncause of the Palestinian people and the commitment \r\nof the international community to the necessary \r\nrestoration of their legitimate rights, in accordance \r\nwith the resolutions of the General Assembly and \r\nas the culmination of their just struggle to pursue \r\nself-determination and end the Israeli occupation \r\nof their territory and homeland.\r\n“On this occasion, the Republic of Iraq, which \r\nhas always supported the cause of the Palestinian \r\npeople and their just struggle to restore their \r\nlegitimate rights, is alarmed by the humanitarian \r\nsuffering sustained by the Palestinian people. \r\nThe Israeli Government persists in its disregard \r\nfor international resolutions and continues its \r\nindiscriminate shelling, demolition of houses and \r\nconfiscation of land in the occupied West Bank \r\nand in Gaza. It also sometimes violates holy sites \r\nand schools, and imposes administrative detention \r\nmeasures. Israel is pursuing its expansionist \r\nsettlement policies, building deep into Palestinian \r\ncities and villages in the West Bank, including East \r\nJerusalem. Other measures aim to undermine the \r\nprospects for peace and abort the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts to enable the Palestinian \r\npeople to establish their independent State on a par \r\nwith the rest of the nations of the world.\r\n“On this International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People, the Republic of Iraq reiterates \r\nits firm position that a just and comprehensive \r\nsolution to the Palestinian question is possible \r\nonly through the establishment of a full-f ledged \r\nindependent Palestinian State within the borders \r\nof 4 June 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nin accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and \r\nthe resolutions of international legitimacy. We urge \r\naction to be taken to implement the provisions of \r\ninternational agreements, the Charter of the United \r\nNations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nand international humanitarian law, particularly \r\nthe Fourth Geneva Convention. We also reject \r\nany step that runs counter to international law in \r\nrelation to Jerusalem. We call on the States of the \r\nworld that have not yet recognized the State of \r\nPalestine, notably certain European States, to do \r\nso as soon as possible, as the Kingdom of Sweden \r\ndid in 2014. We call for support for the aspirations \r\nof our brother Palestinian people to exercise their \r\nlegitimate rights, which would greatly enhance \r\nand consolidate security, stability and peace in the \r\nMiddle East.\r\n“The Republic of Iraq expresses its strong \r\ncondemnation of all Israeli aggressions against \r\nthe Palestinian territories and its support for the \r\nPalestinian National Authority and solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian people. We also call on Arab States \r\nand the international community to support the \r\nefforts of the Palestinian National Authority in the \r\nface of the negative effects of the Israeli occupation \r\non socioeconomic development efforts in the \r\noccupied territories and East Jerusalem, which \r\nresult in heavy annual losses. Full support should \r\nbe provided to the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, \r\ngiven its role in assisting Palestinian refugees.\r\n“We also call on all our Palestinian brethren to \r\npursue efforts for democratic dialogue and consensus \r\nin order to achieve constructive reconciliation and \r\nconsolidate Palestinian national unity as a shield \r\nfor defending their legitimate rights.”\r\nMr. Bermúdez Álvarez (Uruguay) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): As we commemorate another anniversary of \r\nthe International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople, we join other members of the Organization \r\nin expressing the hope that we will soon witness a \r\nmuch-desired peace in the Middle East, enabling its \r\npopulation to exercise its legitimate right to be part of a \r\nsovereign and independent Palestinian State.\r\nToday is the seventy-first anniversary of the General \r\nAssembly’s adoption of resolution 181 (II), which \r\ndetermined the partition of Palestine and the creation \r\nof two States, one Arab and one Jewish. Thanks to the \r\nimpetus provided by that international legal act initiated \r\nby the Organization, Israel and Palestine were able to \r\nconsolidate their identities, rights and obligations as \r\nStates and legal entities recognized by the international \r\ncommunity. Regrettably, this idea was soon drowned \r\nout by the drums of war, and the partition of Palestine \r\ncould not be realized in line with the original plan, with \r\nconsequences of which we are all aware.\r\nFrom that moment on, Uruguay has always \r\nstaunchly and unwaveringly supported this solution \r\nin the belief that it will enable Israel and Palestine to \r\nlive together in peace within secure borders. Today \r\nA/73/PV.42 28/11/2018\r\n22/24 18-40195\r\nUruguay wants to once again affirm its support for the \r\nright of Israel and of Palestine to live in peace within \r\nsecure and recognized borders, in a spirit of renewed \r\ncooperation and free from any threat or action that \r\nbreaches that peace. Likewise, Uruguay reiterates its \r\nsupport for a solution based on two independent States, \r\nas we believe it is the only option that can enable Israel \r\nand Palestine to coexist in peace. There is no plan B, \r\nand there never will be.\r\nUruguay maintains ties of deep friendship with \r\nthe State of Israel and the Palestinian State, whose full \r\nincorporation into the Organization, exercising the \r\nright to self-determination of its people, is the logical \r\noutcome of the entire process it has undertaken on its \r\npath to affirmation as a full-f ledged State. And not just \r\na full-f ledged State but a responsible State, capable of \r\ncompletely eradicating terrorism on its territory and \r\neliminating its incitement and glorification, and of \r\nliving in peace with the State of Israel and other States \r\nof the region.\r\nUruguay was one of the first countries to recognize \r\nthe State of Israel and later, when we realized that this \r\nunfinished process could no longer be delayed, we \r\nrecognized the State of Palestine. It is essential that the \r\ninternational community step up its efforts to support \r\nthis process and encourage the parties to return to the \r\nnegotiating table with a view to reaching a peaceful, \r\njust, negotiated and lasting solution, in accordance with \r\ninternational law, that takes the interests of both parties \r\ninto consideration. In order to achieve that, the parties \r\nmust comply with their obligations under international \r\nlaw and refrain from taking unilateral decisions that \r\nobstruct dialogue. Clear political signals are needed to \r\nbreak the vicious cycle of disagreement and violence.\r\nUnfortunately, despite the many multilateral, \r\nregional and unilateral initiatives that have been \r\ntaken to end the conflict, we are still far from seeing \r\na peaceful and mutually acceptable solution. For that \r\nreason, although a resumption of direct negotiations \r\nmay take time, we encourage the parties to do so in \r\norder to avoid the continued paralysis and stalemate \r\nthat we have witnessed for too many years.\r\nUruguay remains concerned about the ongoing \r\ndetermination of the Israeli authorities to build \r\nsettlement housing in the occupied territories, seize \r\nland and demolish Palestinian homes. We urge \r\nIsrael to end such practices. Settlements are illegal \r\nunder international law and run counter to the \r\nrecommendations of the Middle East Quartet and the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We are concerned \r\nthat if the current trend continues, a two-State solution \r\nwill be virtually unworkable. Any gain of territory or \r\nexercise of a misconceived sovereignty is nullified if \r\nthe price is peace and the dismay and suffering of the \r\npeople of the region are prolonged.\r\nUruguay reaffirms its readiness to continue \r\nworking to reactivate the peace process through all \r\nexisting initiatives in order to break the prevailing \r\nstatus quo and thereby achieve progress in the peace \r\nnegotiations. It is time to begin to overcome the \r\nhatred, incitement, disillusionment, despondency and \r\nfrustration that aff lict the Governments and peoples of \r\nPalestine and Israel.\r\nToday, as was the case more than 70 years ago, \r\nthe international community, which understood and \r\nfavoured this solution, continues to wait with bated \r\nbreath. We are discouraged by the fact that the leaders \r\nignore the path that has been marked out for them \r\nin good faith as the most viable towards a mutually \r\nacceptable solution that can end this long, complex and \r\nhistoric conflict. We once again urge them to return \r\nto dialogue.\r\nMs. Krisnamurthi (Indonesia): Following \r\nyesterday’s observance of the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, the delegation of \r\nIndonesia would like to express its appreciation to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for its continued efforts to support \r\nthe inalienable rights of Palestinians.\r\nEach year we gather here on this occasion to once \r\nagain express a message of solidarity to our Palestinian \r\nbrothers and sisters, returning year after year to do the \r\nsame thing. We have settled into a routine that now sadly \r\nappears to be aimed more at keeping the hopes of the \r\nPalestinian population alive than at seeking a solution \r\nto the problem, and all the more so given the consistent \r\nand continuing violations of international law by the \r\noccupying Power, while the Security Council, which \r\nis charged with the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, appears increasingly helpless.\r\nThat situation reminds me of the words of the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on the situation of human rights \r\nin the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, who \r\ncharacterized the situation as something of a permanent \r\noccupation or annexation. All the State organs of the \r\noccupying Power, whether the Parliament, the judiciary \r\nor its security agencies, deploy various negative \r\n28/11/2018 A/73/PV.42\r\n18-40195 23/24\r\ntactics and breach international law and resolutions \r\nof the United Nations as they please. The occupying \r\nPower’s settlement policy, along with the continuing \r\nconstruction of the separation wall, the displacement \r\nof Palestinians and the use of violence, among other \r\nthings, speak eloquently of its ambitions, but not of any \r\ninterest in peace and resolution.\r\nIt is the view of Indonesia that the occupying \r\nPower must understand that those policies, as well \r\nas its efforts to alter the demographic composition, \r\nlegal status and character of the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem, can yield neither \r\npeace nor security. We again want to express our regret \r\nover the failure of the United Nations to stop such \r\nunlawful acts directed against the Palestinian people \r\nand to protect the innocent civilians who are exposed \r\nto Israel’s brutality and insensitivity.\r\nWe reiterate that peace can be achieved only if \r\ncountries respect their commitments under international \r\nlaw and their obligations under the relevant resolutions \r\nof the Security Council, and commit to a multilateral \r\nprocess aimed at implementing a two-State vision. If \r\nwe base our judgments on the rule of law and justice, \r\nthey will be as clear as day in determining something \r\nthat is legal, let alone supported by several Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and the advisory opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nIn that connection, we call on Member States that \r\nhave yet to do so to recognize the State of Palestine and \r\nsupport the efforts to end the occupation and restore \r\nthe basic rights of the Palestinian people. We cannot \r\ncome up with a just solution without both parties \r\nstanding on an equal footing. The sad reality that \r\nwe are witnessing now is a one-State solution, as the \r\nperformance of the Security Council lags far behind \r\nthe cause of justice and the world’s expectation. We \r\nurge all States to recognize the danger of delaying the \r\nrealization of a two-State solution. We urge Israel to \r\nlift the illegal and dehumanizing blockade on the Gaza \r\nStrip, where all aspects of life have deteriorated into a \r\nhumanitarian catastrophe.\r\nIndonesia condemns all acts of violence against \r\ncivilians, and warns that what the occupying Power \r\nis doing to the people of Gaza is a manifestation of \r\ncollective punishment, which is a blatant violation of \r\ninternational law. We should remember the principle \r\nthat how we treat others is how we invite them to \r\ntreat us.\r\nIndonesia restates its unwavering support and \r\nrecognition of Palestine. We are pleased to offer our \r\nfull support to all the relevant draft resolutions, which \r\nwe consider as balanced and well crafted. We reject any \r\nattempt to distract us from the root cause of the issue, \r\nwhich is the occupation. No issue or aspect should be \r\napproached separately. The ultimate goal must be to \r\nend the occupation and fulfil all the inalienable rights \r\nof the Palestinian people.\r\nMr. Tayel (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The Israeli \r\noccupation of the Palestinian territories has been going \r\non for 51 years. Despite the fact that occupations are by \r\nnature temporary, that particular occupation is slowly \r\nbut surely becoming semi-permanent and perpetuating \r\nthe oldest and most serious conflict in the Middle East, \r\nand as such subverts any prospects for coexistence in \r\nthe region.\r\nThe international community has always called for \r\na resolution to the Palestinian question, in harmony with \r\nPalestinians’ legitimate right to self-determination, \r\npursuant to the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe aspirations of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples \r\nto coexist side by side in peace in two independent \r\nStates, in accordance with the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions and on the basis of the borders of 4 June \r\n1967. Today, however, a quarter of a century after the \r\nOslo Accords, instead of a sovereign Palestinian State \r\nwe are witnessing a quasi-State of illegal settlements, \r\nwith a population of almost 500,000, that is expanding \r\nthroughout the Palestinian territories and is about \r\nto irreversibly undermine the possibility of a two-\r\nState solution.\r\nIndeed, to be clear, we are not meeting at the \r\nUnited Nations to discuss the items related to the \r\nPalestinian question, whether in the General Assembly \r\nor the Security Council, in order to target any one \r\nparty or strip it of its legitimacy. On the contrary, \r\nour discussions are based on what the Organization \r\nrecognized 70 years ago, which was the establishment \r\nof Israel. When we recognized the right of Israel to its \r\nindependent State and the right of the Israeli people to \r\nlive safely within their borders, that right was directly \r\nlinked to the establishment of a Palestinian State and a \r\nsimilar right for the Palestinian people.\r\nThe implementation of the second part of resolution \r\n181 (II) has been overdue for 70 years. The Palestinian \r\nquestion has therefore become the core of the various \r\ncrises in the Middle East, despite the availability of legal \r\nA/73/PV.42 28/11/2018\r\n24/24 18-40195\r\nand political avenues, including the relevant General \r\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions, the latest \r\nof which is resolution 2334 (2016). In that context, \r\nthe annual renewal of the international community’s \r\ncommitments through the General Assembly’s adoption \r\nof resolutions supporting the settlement of this issue \r\nand the establishment of the State of Palestine is the \r\nonly remaining ray of hope for the Palestinian people. \r\nAs their rights are undermined on the ground, our role \r\nat the United Nations is therefore to preserve those \r\ninalienable rights until the parties and politicians with \r\ninfluence recognize that the Palestinian and Israeli \r\npeoples are here to stay on the same land and share the \r\nsame fate. No one people of the two can live in peace \r\nand safety without recognizing the right of the other \r\nto land and peace. Everyone knows that the accepted \r\nand viable parameters for resolving that issue are \r\nthe principle of land for peace and the 1967 borders, \r\nincluding Jerusalem.\r\nI hope that everyone will realize that the choices \r\nfor the Palestinians and Israelis are limited. They must \r\neither return to the negotiating table, on the basis of a two-\r\nState solution and the 1967 borders, as well as the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative, or implement a unilateral one-State \r\nsolution that has been rejected by both peoples for very \r\nlogical reasons. The third choice — to foment populism \r\nleading to an uncontrollable, sustained conflict that \r\nwould deprive the Palestinian and Israeli peoples of all \r\nhope of living a normal life like that of all peoples of \r\nthe world — is too frightening to comtemplate.\r\nI am certain that Egypt’s experience of achieving \r\npeace with Israel can be replicated. Until that reality is \r\nrecognized by all parties, and until serious negotiations \r\nfor reaching a settlement are launched, this year we \r\nmust once again shoulder our responsibility to the \r\nparties to preserve the international legal order that \r\ngoverns all our relations and renew our commitment to \r\nthe criteria of peace during the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this item for \r\ntoday. We will continue the debate tomorrow at 10 a.m., \r\nfollowed by action on draft resolutions under agenda \r\nitems 39 and 38.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
