"United Nations A/73/PV.43\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n43rd plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 30 November 2018, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 39 (continued)\r\nQuestion of Palestine\r\nReport of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People \r\n(А/73/35)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (А/73/346)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (А/73/201)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/73/L.31, A/73/L.32, \r\nА/73/L.33 and А/73/L.34)\r\nMr. Yaakob (Malaysia): At the outset, my delegation \r\nwishes to thank the Permanent Representative of Senegal \r\nfor having introduced yesterday (see A/73/PV.42) the \r\nfour draft resolutions contained in documents A/73/L.31, \r\nentitled “Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People”; A/73/L.32, entitled \r\n“Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine”; \r\nA/73/L.33, entitled “Special information programme \r\non the question of Palestine of the Department of Public \r\nInformation of the Secretariat”; and A/73/L.34, entitled \r\n“Division for Palestinian Rights of the Secretariat”. We \r\nalso wish to thank the Permanent Representative of \r\nMalta for introducing the report of the Committee on \r\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople (A/73/35) at yesterday’s meeting.\r\nAs in previous years, Malaysia is pleased to \r\nco-sponsor the four important draft resolutions under \r\nthis agenda item, which remain critical in highlighting \r\nthe important aspects of the question of Palestine, \r\nin accordance with the long-standing principles on \r\nPalestine, supported by the international community. \r\nMore than 70 years have elapsed since the General \r\nAssembly adopted resolution 181 (II), which provided \r\nfor the partition of Palestine, ostensibly predicated on the \r\nestablishment of two sovereign States. Unfortunately, \r\nthe establishment of only one State — Israel — was \r\nbrought to fruition in 1948.\r\nIn the intervening decades, Israel has sought to \r\nextinguish the legitimate right to self-determination of \r\nthe Palestinian people. The civilian population of the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories continues to endure \r\nrepression at the hands of Israel, which persists in its \r\nf lagrant violations of international law. The adoption of \r\nthe Jewish nation-State law in July 2018, the aggressive \r\nexpansion of Israeli settlements and the relentless \r\ndisproportionate use of force against unarmed civilians \r\ninvolved in the Great March of Return are but recent \r\nexamples of a long-standing pattern of systematic abuse \r\nmeted out against the oppressed people of Palestine.\r\nEfforts towards the establishment of an independent \r\nState of Palestine based on the pre-1967 borders will \r\nremain an integral part of the foreign policy framework \r\nof the new Malaysian Administration. Malaysia has \r\nconsistently advanced a principled position on this \r\nmatter in various international forums, including during \r\nits tenure as a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil in 2015 and 2016. For example, on 23 December \r\n2016, Malaysia, together with New Zealand, Senegal and \r\nVenezuela, worked towards the adoption of resolution \r\n2334 (2016), which signified a major breakthrough \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

The resolution affirms that \r\nIsrael’s establishment of settlements in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, has \r\nno legal validity and constitutes a f lagrant violation \r\nof international law. The resolution also calls, inter \r\nalia, for the cessation of all Israeli settlement activities \r\nand the reversal of negative trends on the ground that \r\nprejudice the realization of a two-State solution.\r\nUnfortunately, Israel’s illegal conduct has continued \r\nunabated, to the great detriment of Palestinians. It is \r\nindeed tragic that the interests of innocent civilians, \r\nincluding women and children, have long been \r\nsuperseded by extraneous factors that render the major \r\nPowers unable or unwilling to hold Israel accountable \r\nfor its actions.\r\nNotwithstanding the asymmetries in military \r\npower and political influence between Israel and \r\nPalestine, the moral persuasiveness and steadfastness \r\nof the latter’s struggle remain undiminished. Even in \r\nthe most turbulent of times, the Palestinian people \r\nremain resilient, retaining hope for a future in which \r\nthey will assume their rightful place as a full and equal \r\nmember of the community of nations. Their aspirations \r\nshould not be denied any longer.\r\nMalaysia continues to believe that a two-State \r\nsolution, in which the Palestinians and the Israelis live \r\nside by side in peace, based on the pre-1967 borders, with \r\nEast Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine, is the only \r\nviable solution to this long-standing conflict. Malaysia \r\nremains firmly committed to concerted multilateral \r\nefforts aimed at ending the longest occupation in modern \r\nhistory through the establishment of a sovereign State \r\nof Palestine. The international community’s demand of \r\nIsrael is very simple: comply with all relevant General \r\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions, as well as \r\nrelevant international law.\r\nMr. Hermida Castillo (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Nicaragua aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representative of Venezuela on behalf \r\nof the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and by the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Senegal and Malta in \r\ntheir respective capacities as Chair and Rapporteur of \r\nthe Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights \r\nof the Palestinian People (see A/73/PV.42).\r\nIt is an honour to share with and read out to the \r\nAssembly the message of President Daniel Ortega \r\nSaavedra and First Lady and Vice-President Rosario \r\nMurillo to commemorate the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, addressed to \r\nour friend Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State \r\nof Palestine.\r\n“My esteemed brother, on the occasion of \r\nthe International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People, on behalf of the Government of \r\nReconciliation and National Unity, the Sandinista \r\nNational Liberation Front, the people of Nicaragua, \r\nRosario and myself, I wish to extend to you our \r\nmost sincere expression of solidarity with the \r\nheroic Palestinian people, while reaffirming our \r\nfull support for their tireless struggle for freedom \r\nand the full exercise of their inalienable right to \r\nself-determination, including the establishment of \r\na Palestinian State, based on the pre-4 June 1967 \r\nborders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We \r\npay tribute today to the life, legacy, steadfastness \r\nand conviction of our very dear brother, President \r\nYasser Arafat, leader of the struggle for the \r\nliberation of Palestine, and to his commitment to \r\nthe Palestinian people. We remember his historic \r\nvisit to Nicaragua in July 1980.\r\n“Comrade President Mahmoud Abbas, we \r\npersonally commend you and call attention to your \r\nsteadfast struggle, while advocating diplomacy \r\nand negotiations, as well as the holding of an \r\ninternational conference to find a solution to the \r\nquestion of Palestine, which we welcome. Nicaragua \r\nbelieves that achieving peace and stability in the \r\nMiddle East is feasible through negotiations and \r\nthe full implementation of the relevant General \r\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions on \r\nthe question of Palestine, in particular Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2334 (2016), of December \r\n2016, which are the legal instruments based on \r\ninternational law to achieve peace and stability in \r\nthe region. Our peoples enjoy a very special and \r\nhistorical relationship, and, together with the rest of \r\nthe international community, we deem it necessary \r\nto step up efforts to realize the establishment of the \r\nPalestinian State through peaceful means, thereby \r\nensuring just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\r\n“With everlasting affection and love, we once \r\nagain express the greetings of the Sandinista \r\nmovement and are certain that, over time, our \r\neternally brotherly peoples will continue to \r\nstrengthen those fraternal and revolutionary \r\nbonds, which have united us in our resolve for a \r\nbetter world.”\r\n30/11/2018 A/73/PV.43\r\n18-40536 3/26\r\nMr. Pirez Pérez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nthank the representative of Malta for introducing \r\n(see A/73/PV.42) the report of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople (A/73/35).\r\nWe express our unwavering solidarity and support to \r\nthe Palestinian Government and people for the accession \r\nof Palestine as a full State Member of the United \r\nNations. Cuba reaffirms its unwavering solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian people and its commitment to continue \r\nsupporting them in the legitimate struggle for justice, \r\ndignity and peace, as our Foreign Minister made \r\nclear in his message of solidarity to the Palestinian \r\npeople yesterday on behalf of the Cuban Government \r\nand people.\r\nCuba also reiterates its demand to immediately \r\nend the prolonged and illegal Israeli occupation of the \r\nPalestinian territories and the blockade of the Gaza \r\nStrip that has lasted for more than a decade. A two-\r\nState solution and a comprehensive, just, peaceful \r\nand lasting settlement of the Palestinian question will \r\nnot be possible as long as Israel continues to violate \r\ninternational law, the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the relevant United Nations resolutions, including \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2334 (2016), in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.\r\nCuba expresses its deep concern about the situation \r\nin the Middle East region, which is plagued by violence, \r\ninterference in internal affairs, foreign aggression and \r\nlong-standing conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict at the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is time \r\nto settle historical debts with the State of Palestine and \r\nrestore the inalienable rights of its people, which have \r\nbeen violated by Israel during 50 years of occupation, \r\nrepression, collective punishment, the destruction \r\nand confiscation of Palestinian land and property, \r\nforced displacements and colonialist settlements in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories.\r\nCuba reiterates in the strongest terms its rejection \r\nof Israel’s use of disproportionate and indiscriminate \r\nforce against Palestinian civilians in the occupied \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem and particularly \r\nthe Gaza Strip, in grave and f lagrant violation of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international \r\nhumanitarian law. We condemn once again the illegal \r\nconstruction and expansion of Israeli settlements in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory and the demolition \r\nand seizure of Palestinian property. All such measures, \r\ntogether with the blockade of the Gaza Strip, violate the \r\nFourth Geneva Convention and weaken the viability of \r\na two-State solution.\r\nWe reiterate our unconditional support for a \r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting solution to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict, based on the establishment of \r\ntwo States, that would allow the Palestinian people to \r\nexercise its right to self-determination and enjoy an \r\nindependent and sovereign State within the pre-1967 \r\nborders, with East Jerusalem as its capital and the right \r\nof return for refugees. We reject the unilateral action \r\ntaken by the United States to establish diplomatic \r\nrepresentation in the city of Jerusalem, thereby further \r\nincreasing tensions in the region.\r\nCuba once again calls for Israel’s total and \r\nunconditional withdrawal from the Syrian Golan and \r\nall other occupied Arab territories. We recall that any \r\nmeasure or action aimed at modifying the legal, physical \r\nand demographic status and institutional structure of \r\nthe occupied Syrian Golan, as well as Israel’s measures \r\nto exercise its jurisdiction and administration in that \r\nterritory, constitute violations of international law and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nLastly, we call for respect for multilateralism and \r\nthe Charter, and for an end to interference in the internal \r\naffairs of others, foreign aggression and the sponsorship \r\nof terrorist groups to foment instability and conflict in \r\nthe Middle East, as well as the invention of pretexts and \r\nrationales in an attempt to legitimize the unilateral use \r\nof force and aggression against sovereign States.\r\nMs. Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I thank \r\nyou, Madam President, for convening today’s meeting. \r\nI also thank the Chair of the Committee on the Exercise \r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People for \r\nhis statement (see A/73/PV.42). I take this opportunity \r\nto express my gratitude for the valuable efforts of the \r\nCommittee, the Division for Palestinian Rights and \r\nthe special information programme on the question of \r\nPalestine of the Department of Public Information.\r\nAmid the dangerous crises throughout the Middle \r\nEast that have been the focus of the United Nations, \r\nthe Palestinian question remains the core and longest-\r\nstanding issue that the General Assembly has been \r\nconsidering. This year marks the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the Nakba — the Palestinian catastrophe — the \r\ntragic repercussions of which the Palestinians continue \r\nto suffer. Over the past seven decades, that issue has \r\nbeen a hallmark at the international level, leading to \r\nA/73/PV.43 30/11/2018\r\n4/26 18-40536\r\nthe complete rejection by the international community \r\nof the Israeli occupation and illegal settlements, as \r\nwell as violations of international law and the rights \r\nof the Palestinian people. The international community \r\nhas also shown its full solidarity with the Palestinian \r\npeople’s efforts to exercise their inalienable rights. \r\nAs members of the international community, we must \r\ncontinue to shoulder our responsibilities with regard \r\nto that issue until a just, lasting and comprehensive \r\nsettlement is reached. That would have a positive impact \r\non regional and international peace and security.\r\nThe State of Qatar reiterates its support for \r\ninternational efforts aimed at achieving peace in the \r\nMiddle East and settling the Palestinian question, based \r\non the agreed terms of reference, the international \r\nresolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative, as well as \r\nthe principle of the two-State solution, with Israel \r\nand Palestine living side by side in peace and security \r\nwithin the 1967 borders; an end to the Israeli occupation \r\nof the occupied Arab territories, including the Syrian \r\nGolan; ensuring all rights of the Palestinian people; \r\nand achieving a just solution to the issue of refugees, in \r\naccordance with resolution 194 (III).\r\nThe various annual resolutions on the Palestinian \r\nquestion and the Middle East adopted by the General \r\nAssembly have enjoyed long-standing international \r\nunanimity with respect to the various aspects of that \r\nissue, which highlights the importance of respect for \r\nthe principles of international law and the purposes of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. It calls for a complete \r\nhalt to all Israeli settlement activities and unilateral \r\nmeasures in the occupied Palestinian territories, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem. Such measures run contrary \r\nto international law and aim to change the legal status \r\nand demographic composition of Jerusalem.\r\nThe situation in the Gaza Strip is worrisome, as \r\nthe humanitarian situation suffered by its population \r\nis deteriorating as a result of the unjust blockade, now \r\nentering its eleventh year. The State of Qatar is deeply \r\ncommitted to providing humanitarian assistance. In \r\nthat regard, His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad \r\nAl-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, has ordered \r\nthe provision of urgent assistance in the amount of \r\n$150 million to alleviate the difficult situation in Gaza \r\nand ensure the necessary supply of fuel for producing \r\nelectricity. His efforts are part of the State of Qatar’s \r\nresolve to play a positive role in promoting stability, \r\nwhich is a prerequisite to establishing peace.\r\nAs the issue of the Middle East persists, so does \r\nthe need to continue the work of the various relevant \r\nUnited Nations organs, agencies and programmes, most \r\nnotably the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which \r\nis one of the oldest and largest United Nations agencies \r\nthat plays an essential role in supporting millions of \r\nPalestinian refugees. The State of Qatar has stepped up \r\nits financial assistance to UNRWA by providing it with \r\n$50 million dollars this year, which contributed to the \r\ntimely annual opening of UNRWA schools.\r\nIn conclusion, on the occasion of the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, we \r\nreaffirm the State of Qatar’s full solidarity with the \r\nbrotherly Palestinian people. We underscore once again \r\nthat the State of Qatar will pursue its commitment \r\nto promoting their legitimate rights and supporting \r\nefforts to achieve peace in the Middle East, based on \r\ninternational terms of reference and the principle of \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, while striving to \r\nend all the conflicts being endured by the peoples of \r\nthe region.\r\nMr. Islam (Bangladesh): We join others in \r\nreaffirming our delegation’s commitment to the \r\ninalienable rights of the people of Palestine on the \r\nauspicious occasion of the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People. We reiterate \r\nour principled support for draft resolutions A/73/L.31, \r\nA/73/L.32, А/73/L.33 and А/73/L.34, which are before \r\nus today.\r\nWe support the rights of the Palestinian people \r\nto self-determination and their long struggle for \r\npeace and justice. Our unwavering solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people and their legitimate aspiration to \r\nan independent State of Palestine, based on the 1967 \r\nborders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, stems from \r\nour constitutional obligation.\r\nBangladesh condemns the heinous attacks on \r\nthe people of Palestine and denounces the illegal \r\nsettlements, including the expansion plans, and any \r\nother action by the occupying force that obstructs \r\nnegotiations towards a viable two-State solution. The \r\nhuman rights situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories remains a grave concern for the world \r\ncommunity and the Organization. Foreign occupation, \r\nwhich has subjected the Palestinian people to gross and \r\nsystematic human rights violations and untold pain and \r\n30/11/2018 A/73/PV.43\r\n18-40536 5/26\r\nsuffering, remains one of the root causes of conflicts \r\nand other scourges around the world.\r\nBangladesh urges the comity of nations to prevail \r\nupon Israel to immediately halt its illegal settlements in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories, lift the blockade in \r\nthe Gaza Strip and put an end to all forms of occupation \r\nand violence. We remain concerned over the total \r\ndisregard by Israel of the provisions of Security Council \r\nresolution 2234 (2016). Immediate priority must be \r\ngiven to ensuring international protection for the \r\nPalestinian people, who have suffered for decades from \r\nthe occupying Power’s policy of collective punishment.\r\nThe continued breaches of international \r\nhumanitarian law and systematic human rights \r\nviolations in the occupied Palestinian territories have \r\ngiven rise to an egregious culture of impunity. In the \r\nabsence of effective international accountability, the \r\noccupying Power continues to persecute Palestinian \r\ncivilians, imprison and abuse scores of Palestinians \r\nin its detention centres, and dispossess and evict \r\nthousands of Palestinian families through its unlawful \r\nconstruction and expansion of settlements.\r\nBangladesh continues to insist on the lifting of \r\nthe illegal Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, which \r\nhas created a dire humanitarian situation. Provocative \r\npolicies and legal measures concerning occupied East \r\nJerusalem and the Holy Al-Aqsa Mosque must be \r\nreversed in deference to the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions and international public opinion. We \r\nreaffirm the overriding importance of preserving the \r\nquestion of East Jerusalem as a final-status issue in the \r\npeace process. We reiterate the Assembly’s assertion \r\nthat any decision or action that seeks to alter the \r\ncharacter, status or demographic composition of the \r\nholy city of Jerusalem has no legal effect, is null and \r\nvoid and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant \r\nresolutions of the Security Council.\r\nWe reiterate our concern over the prolonged \r\nuncertain situation endured by millions of Palestinian \r\nrefugees in a number of host countries. We reaffirm the \r\nneed to ensure enhanced, predictable and sustainable \r\nfunding for the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\n(UNRWA). We call upon Member States in a position \r\nto do so to enable UNRWA to discharge its mandate in \r\na meaningful manner.\r\nBangladesh believes that if a lasting peace for the \r\npeople and the State of Palestine is to be achieved, the \r\ntimely implementation of the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions, the road map, the Arab Peace Initiative \r\nand the efforts made by the Quartet is of paramount \r\nimportance. We thank Egypt for its recent initiatives \r\naimed at de-escalating tension in the region. As Chair \r\nof the Organization of Islamic Cooperation Council \r\nof Foreign Ministers, we will continue to work with \r\nthe international community for a resolution of the \r\nPalestinian question.\r\nBefore concluding, let me quote from the message \r\ndelivered by my Prime Minister on the occasion of \r\nthis year’s International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People:\r\n“We must not let the hope of peace fade away. \r\nWe must, and I believe we will, resume the peace \r\nprocess without any further delay. We urge all \r\nconcerned to be pragmatic in their approach and \r\nwork together, hand in hand, for the establishment \r\nof an independent homeland for the Palestinian \r\npeople where they can live in peace and in dignity \r\nside by side with their neighbours.”\r\nMr. Al-Mouallimi (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAt the outset, I would like to express my gratitude for \r\nthe efforts of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People to uphold \r\nthe legitimate rights of the brotherly Palestinian people \r\nin order to enable them to exercise their rights, which \r\nare guaranteed by the relevant international resolutions.\r\nToday marks the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople, or what is known as the Day of Al-Nakba. \r\nSeventy years have elapsed since the greatest \r\nhumanitarian disaster in the world. It was embodied by \r\nthe expulsion of the owners of the land, the accordance \r\nof rights to those who did not have them and the \r\ndeprivation of the rights of their lawful holders. Seventy \r\nyears have elapsed since the displacement of an entire \r\npeople from their homeland, their properties seized and \r\ntheir homes demolished. Seventy years have elapsed \r\nand the Palestinian people continue to suffer alienation \r\nfrom their homeland and the loss of families. Seventy \r\nyears have elapsed and the Palestinian people continue \r\nto suffer the consequences of an occupation that does \r\nnot respect any international, ethical or human law.\r\nIt is regrettable that the occupation remains an issue \r\nof debate in this century. The Arab-Israeli conflict \r\nremains the most protracted current conflict in the \r\nArab region, with all its miseries, pains and violations \r\nA/73/PV.43 30/11/2018\r\n6/26 18-40536\r\nagainst humanity. Nothing justifies the continuation \r\nof that conflict, as the international community has \r\nreached consensus vis-à-vis the need to uphold the \r\nrights of the Palestinian people to self-determination \r\nand to establish their Palestinian State based on the 1967 \r\nborders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in line \r\nwith the Arab Peace Initiative, which was submitted by \r\nmy country and recognized by the States of the world, \r\nand the relevant international resolutions.\r\nThrough its repeated aggressions and violations, \r\nIsrael has demonstrated that it considers itself to be \r\nabove the law. It fails to respect international resolutions \r\nand benefits from the silence of the international \r\ncommunity by not addressing its war crimes, including \r\nthe unjust blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip, which \r\nhas aggravated the humanitarian situation there. Not \r\nsatisfied merely with building the apartheid wall, which \r\nruns counter to all democratic and humanitarian values, \r\nIsrael has also adopted the Jewish nation-State law, \r\nwhich publicly consecrates racism and discrimination \r\nagainst the Palestinian people, who are the rightful \r\nlandowners and right holders.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia condemns Israeli \r\nviolations and reaffirms its complete rejection of all \r\nIsraeli policies, practices and plans that are illegal, \r\nnull and void. We reject Israeli attempts to practise \r\nracial discrimination against the Palestinian people, \r\nerase their national identity and infringe on their \r\nlegitimate rights. My country also strongly condemns \r\nthe illegal Israeli practices of constructing settlements \r\non territories of the State of Palestine occupied since \r\n1967. Israel also expands existing settlements so as \r\nto jeopardize any remaining possibility of achieving \r\nthe two-State solution. Moreover, such settlement \r\npractices constitute a f lagrant breach of international \r\nlaw and the relevant international charters, conventions \r\nand resolutions.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia attaches paramount \r\nimportance to the Palestinian question. For us, it is the \r\nuppermost issue, as confirmed by the Custodian of \r\nthe Two Holy Mosques, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Saud, during the Arab League Summit, also known \r\nas the Jerusalem Summit, held in Dhahran in April. \r\nThe Assembly recalls our honourable stance towards \r\nthe Palestinian people. The Kingdom stresses the \r\nimportance of achieving a comprehensive and lasting \r\npeace in the Middle East as a strategic means of \r\nending the Arab-Israeli conflict, in line with the two-\r\nState solution, the international terms of reference \r\nand the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, which ensures the \r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State based on the 4 June \r\n1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, \r\nand of putting an end to the Israeli occupation of all \r\nArab territories, including the Syrian Arab Golan and \r\nthe Lebanese territories.\r\nIn conclusion, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a \r\nsponsor of the draft resolutions before us, concerning \r\nPalestine, and will vote in favour of them, as they \r\nembody the position of the Kingdom towards supporting \r\nthe Palestinian question. We believe in the right of the \r\nbrotherly Palestinian people to an independent State \r\nthat fulfils their dreams and ambitions.\r\nWe are stunned by the attempts of Israel and \r\nits allies to submit a draft resolution that seeks to \r\ndivert attention from the core of that issue. The core \r\nof the Palestinian question is the occupation and the \r\nblockade — nothing else. Therefore, draft resolutions \r\nsubmitted to divert attention from the suffering of \r\nthe Palestinian people and from the unjust practices \r\ncarried out by Israel are merely attempts to justify \r\nthe occupation. Those attempts are not accepted or \r\npermitted by the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Bessedik (Algeria): I thank you, Madam \r\nPresident, for convening this important annual debate \r\non the question of Palestine and the situation in the \r\nMiddle East.\r\nMy delegation would also like to express its deep \r\nappreciation to the members of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople for recommending the four draft resolutions \r\nbefore us, and to thank the Chair and the Rapporteur \r\nfor their introductions, as well as for the introduction of \r\nthe Committee’s annual report (A/73/35).\r\nOn this International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People, my delegation wishes to express, in \r\nits national capacity, its serious preoccupation with the \r\ncontinued systematic pattern of violations of the human \r\nrights of the Palestinian people and of other Arabs in the \r\noccupied territories. The expansion of Israeli settlement \r\nactivities, along with the brutality of the Israeli settlers, \r\nthe Israeli exploitation of the natural resources of the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories and the Syrian Golan \r\nHeights, the confiscation of land, the demolition of \r\nhomes and the displacement of Palestinian civilians, \r\nare in violation of international law, international \r\nhumanitarian law and the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions. That includes the segregation, isolation \r\n30/11/2018 A/73/PV.43\r\n18-40536 7/26\r\nand obstruction of Palestinian movement by numerous \r\nmeasures, including annexation, the apartheid wall, \r\nthe permit regime, hundreds of checkpoints and \r\nthe systematic collective punishment of the entire \r\nPalestinian civilian population.\r\nMy delegation condemns the abuses that detainees \r\nand prisoners, including children, suffer in detention \r\ncentres. My delegation condemns the excessive use \r\nof force by the occupying Power and the application \r\nof the death penalty. My delegation condemns Israeli \r\ninstitutions in which Palestinians have no representation. \r\nTwo examples of that injustice are Israel’s brutal, illegal, \r\noppressive and destructive policies in the recent protests \r\nin Gaza and its plans for Khan Al-Ahmar, a Palestinian \r\nshepherding community. Some 200 people live in Khan \r\nAl-Ahmar, just a few kilometres east of Jerusalem, in \r\nan area where Israel has long endeavoured to minimize \r\nthe Palestinian presence and expand settlements. Israel \r\nplans to raze the entire community, claiming that all \r\nstructures were built illegally. But how could it be \r\notherwise, since Palestinians cannot obtain building \r\npermits? Palestinians are not inherently law-breakers, \r\nas suggested by Israel.\r\nThe Gaza Strip, with a population of nearly \r\n2 million, has essentially become an open-air prison. \r\nThe Israeli-imposed blockade, which has continued \r\nfor 11 years, has led to economic collapse, soaring \r\nunemployment rates, polluted drinking water and deep \r\ndespair. Since 30 March, more than 5,000 Palestinians \r\nhave been injured by live Israeli gunfire and more \r\nthan 170 killed, including 31 minors, according to the \r\nbriefing by the Executive Director of the Israeli human \r\nrights organization B’Tselem before the Security \r\nCouncil on 18 October (see S/PV.8375).\r\nIn addition to those violations, since 1967 Israel \r\nhas continued, as the occupying Power, to violate the \r\nGeneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian \r\nPersons in Time of War of 12 August 1949. Yet Israel \r\nenjoys impunity. It is pertinent to mention here that \r\nthe international community is in favour of protecting \r\ncivilians and bringing an end to Israeli practices and \r\nf lagrant violations of international humanitarian law \r\nand relevant resolutions.\r\nDespite the numerous calls of the international \r\ncommunity on Israel to cease its illegal policies \r\nand measures, the world still bears witness to the \r\npersistence of the Israeli occupier’s policy of settlements \r\non Palestinian land and the application of group \r\npunishment through the blockade in Gaza, in f lagrant \r\nviolation of international humanitarian law and human \r\nrights. The Israeli settlement activities on Palestinian \r\nland, including Al-Quds Al-Sharif, and in the Syrian \r\nGolan Heights, are a violation of international law, \r\nincluding Security Council resolution 2334 (2016), \r\nwhich in paragraph 1:\r\n“[r]eaffirms that the establishment by Israel of \r\nsettlements in the Palestinian territory occupied \r\nsince 1967, including East Jerusalem, has no \r\nlegal validity and constitutes a f lagrant violation \r\nunder international law and a major obstacle to the \r\nachievement of the two-State solution and a just, \r\nlasting and comprehensive peace”.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 497 (1981) confirms \r\nthe same situation regarding the Syrian Golan Heights, \r\nstating in paragraph 1:\r\n“the Israeli decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction \r\nand administration in the occupied Syrian Golan \r\nHeights is null and void and without international \r\nlegal effect”.\r\nThe ongoing Israeli practices and violations, in \r\nparticular settlements, are major obstacles to the two-\r\nState solution. We urge the international community \r\nto fulfil its obligations towards the Palestinian people, \r\nwho have been denied the benefit of human rights \r\nfor more than 70 years. The international community \r\nmust exert pressure on Israel to freeze all settlement \r\nactivities on Palestinian land and in the occupied Arab \r\nterritories, including the Syrian Golan Heights.\r\nFinally, we reject any possible attempts to harm the \r\nintegrity of long-standing General Assembly resolutions \r\nreaffirming the Palestinian people’s inalienable rights \r\nand the core principles and internationally endorsed \r\nparameters for the achievement of a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace in line with international law, the \r\nrelevant resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative.\r\nMr. Mamdouhi (Islamic Republic of Iran): For the \r\npast 70 years, the question of Palestine has been not \r\nonly an Islamic-Arabic issue but also one of the most \r\ncomplicated political and legal issues at the regional \r\nand international levels. During this time, the people \r\nof Palestine have experienced nothing but oppression, \r\ndisplacement, misery and occupation of their lands. \r\nThey have always been deprived of their basic and \r\ninalienable rights.\r\nA/73/PV.43 30/11/2018\r\n8/26 18-40536\r\nThis year, which marks the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the tragic Nakba of the Palestinian people in 1948, \r\nthe military aggression against peaceful demonstrations \r\nby Palestinian civilians in Gaza has led to the death of \r\nmore than 170 martyrs and the injury of thousands more \r\nPalestinian citizens. Since its creation, the occupying \r\nregime has ignored international law and defied the \r\ndecisions of international institutions, including many \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil. It has violated other international legal \r\ninstruments through its actions as it continues to commit \r\nnumerous war crimes, carry out its apartheid policy, \r\ncommit massive and systematic violations of human \r\nrights, sponsor State terrorism, expand settlements and \r\ndisplace an ever-increasing number of Palestinians.\r\nWe note with grave concern the latest disturbing \r\ndevelopments in the occupied Palestinian territories, \r\nas reflected in the document under consideration today \r\n(A/73/346). The injustices have continued for more \r\nthan seven decades through systematic and unabated \r\nviolations of the human rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople, including the demolition of homes, the forced \r\ndisplacement of Palestinian civilians, the arrest and \r\ndetention of Palestinians, including children, persistent \r\nacts of violence, and terror and provocations committed \r\nby Israeli settlers and extremists at sensitive religious \r\nsites, in particular the Al-Aqsa Mosque. In fact, the \r\noccupation of Palestinian territories lies at the heart of \r\nthe protracted situation of crisis in the Middle East. The \r\nIsraeli regime’s criminal acts against the Palestinians \r\nand other peoples of the region are currently the gravest \r\nthreat posed to regional and international peace and \r\nsecurity. Peace in the Middle East cannot be achieved \r\nthrough the promotion of a discriminatory policy \r\nof blind support for the Israeli regime’s occupation, \r\ntorture, annihilation, intimidation and aggression.\r\nLikewise, Israel continues to f lout all international \r\nregimes that govern weapons of mass destruction by \r\nrefusing to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention \r\nand the Biological Weapons Convention. Nuclear \r\nweapons in the hands of the Israeli regime pose the \r\nmost serious threat to the security of all States of the \r\nMiddle East.\r\nAs pointed out in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the wrongful and unwise decision of the \r\nPresident of the United States, concerning Al-Quds, \r\nissued on 6 December 2017, in which he announced \r\nhis intention to relocate the United States Embassy \r\nto Al-Quds, was severely condemned as a naked and \r\nimmoral aggression against the rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople, as well as a provocative action that is apt to \r\npush the region into greater violence and anarchy. \r\nEmboldened by the United States decision and a number \r\nof other changes in the political landscape, the Israeli \r\nregime now seems to have decided to totally negate any \r\nPalestinian right to statehood.\r\nAs has been the case for decades, the situation \r\nin Palestine requires urgent international action and \r\nattention. The Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view \r\nthat any solution to the crisis requires the termination of \r\nthe occupation, crimes and violations committed by the \r\nIsraeli regime; the restoration of the inalienable rights \r\nof the Palestinian people to self-determination; and the \r\nestablishment of their independent and viable State of \r\nPalestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.\r\nRegarding the occupation of the Golan by the Israeli \r\nregime, we consider the Golan to be an integral part of \r\nthe territory of the Syrian Arab Republic. We condemn \r\nall measures taken by the illegitimate occupying Power \r\nto undermine the territorial integrity of Syria, and we \r\nexpress our deep concern over the grave deterioration \r\nof the human rights situation and the increase in the \r\nnumber of illegal Jewish settlements in the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like once again to \r\nreiterate our unwavering commitment to a just and \r\ncomprehensive solution to the question of Palestine and \r\nto the immediate restoration of the inalienable rights \r\nof the Palestinian people, including their right to self-\r\ndetermination and to their independent and viable State \r\nof Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. In \r\nthat regard, we maintain our support for the Palestinian \r\npeople in their rightful and legitimate struggle against \r\nthe occupation and for their just quest to exercise their \r\nright to self-determination.\r\nMr. Atlassi (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople and its Chair, Mr. Cheikh Niang, for the \r\nCommittee’s valuable and tireless efforts to support \r\njustice for the Palestinian people and oversee its various \r\nprogrammes designed to enable the Palestinian people \r\nto achieve the just, legitimate, national and sovereign \r\nindependence they deserve.\r\nThe International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People, which occurs on 29 November, \r\n30/11/2018 A/73/PV.43\r\n18-40536 9/26\r\npresented His Majesty King Mohammed VI with another \r\nopportunity this year to send a message of solidarity to \r\nthe Chair of the Committee, reiterating his full support \r\nfor the Palestinian people and their leaders, first and \r\nforemost, His Excellency President Mahmoud Abbas. \r\nIn that letter, he also expresses the full, steadfast \r\nand lasting support of the Kingdom of Morocco for \r\nthe historical and legitimate rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople, most notably their right to form an independent \r\nState that is based on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital, and that is stable and viable, \r\nliving side by side with Israel in peace, security and \r\nsafety in accordance with international resolutions.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, whose King presides \r\nover the Al-Quds Committee, is following with great \r\nconcern the escalation that Israel has chosen to pursue \r\nin Palestine in general, and Jerusalem in particular, to \r\nundermine the legal status of Al-Quds Al-Sharif as \r\ndefined in resolutions of international legitimacy, which \r\nconsider it to be an inseparable part of the Palestinian \r\nterritories occupied since 1967.\r\nIn that regard, Israel seeks religious and ideological \r\nconflicts through the temporal and spatial partitioning \r\nof Al-Quds Al-Sharif, as well as repeated, systematic \r\nviolations against the sanctity of the Al-Aqsa Mosque \r\nand its worshippers, while intensifying settlement \r\nactivities, including in Al-Quds Al-Sharif, in violation \r\nof Security Council resolutions, particularly resolution \r\n2334 (2016). In his letter, His Majesty the King of \r\nMorocco asserts that:\r\n“[t]he Moroccan people’s relationship with \r\nPalestine, and in particular Al-Quds, is neither new \r\nnor fortuitous. It is an emotional relationship that \r\nis deeply rooted in the imagination of Moroccans, \r\nas individuals and as a nation. Moroccan pilgrims \r\ntravelling to Mecca and Medina used to visit the \r\nholy city of Al-Quds — the first of the two kiblahs \r\nand home to the third holy mosque — given the \r\ncity’s religious and spiritual significance. No \r\nwonder then that many of them, including scholars, \r\nmystics and merchants, chose to settle in Al-Quds \r\nand protect the holy places there.”\r\nThe issue of Al-Quds and the Palestinian question \r\nhave always been our major concern for the following \r\nreasons. We are committed to and responsible for a \r\njust and legitimate cause. The Palestinian question is \r\na central issue in the Middle East and the core conflict \r\nin the region. Achieving a just, comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace on the basis of the two-State solution \r\nand in accordance with Security Council resolutions \r\nand the Arab Peace Initiative is a strategic choice, \r\nnot a political manoeuvre. The issue of Al-Quds has \r\nspecial significance not only to the Arab and Muslim \r\nUmmah — given that the holy city is home to the \r\nblessed Al-Aqsa Mosque — but also to all peace-loving \r\npeople, given that the city stands for tolerance and \r\ninterfaith coexistence. Any unilateral action affecting \r\nAl-Quds is unacceptable, illegal and illegitimate in that \r\nit represents a serious violation of international law, \r\nincluding General Assembly resolutions and Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 476 (1980) and 478 (1980), as well \r\nas the “Uniting for Peace” resolution ES-10/19, adopted \r\nin 2017 at the tenth emergency special session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nResolving the Palestinian question on the basis \r\nof the resolutions of international legitimacy would \r\ndeprive extremist and terrorist groups of their \r\narguments, especially as they have been exploiting the \r\nlack of prospects for the settlement of the Palestinian \r\nquestion and that of Al-Quds, using it as a pretext to \r\njustify their criminal agenda in the region. The illegal \r\nmeasures concerning Al-Quds fuel religious sentiment, \r\ngiven the spiritual character of the holy city, with \r\nthe potential risk of turning a political conflict into a \r\nreligious one. That would be extremely dangerous for \r\ninternational peace and security and for the desired \r\nharmony and coexistence between different cultures \r\nand civilizations.\r\nHis Majesty the King of Morocco has confirmed \r\nthat it is not enough to talk about Palestine without \r\naddressing the suffering of the Palestinian people. \r\nMorocco is aware of the difficult conditions that \r\nPalestinians in Gaza are facing. In 2009 and 2014, \r\nHis Majesty ordered airlifts of medical and food \r\nassistance based on our policy of solidarity, which is \r\na cornerstone of Morocco’s foreign policy. This year \r\nduring Ramadan, His Majesty personally oversaw the \r\nlaunch of a humanitarian initiative in Gaza, Al-Quds \r\nand Ramallah.\r\nHis Majesty has also established a field hospital of \r\nthe Royal Moroccan Armed Forces in the Gaza Strip. \r\nThat hospital offers various medical services. His \r\nMajesty has underscored that\r\n“[t]hose initiatives, which are for the benefit of \r\nour Palestinian brothers, complement our actions \r\nthat we undertake as Chairperson of the Al-Quds \r\nA/73/PV.43 30/11/2018\r\n10/26 18-40536\r\nCommittee of the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation. We carry out bilateral political and \r\ndiplomatic activities and in international forums, as \r\nwell as through field work undertaken by the Bayt \r\nMal Al-Quds Al-Sharif Agency. This operational \r\nand field mechanism of the Al-Quds Committee \r\nworks under our personal supervision to carry out \r\nconcrete plans and projects for the benefit of our \r\nJerusalemite brothers, with the aim of maintaining \r\nthe cultural identity of the holy city and improving \r\nthe social and living conditions of the inhabitants \r\nof Al-Quds, while supporting their struggle and \r\nencouraging them to remain in Al-Quds”.\r\nThe only correct way to resolve the Palestinian \r\nquestion is not by war, bloodshed and the killing of \r\ninnocent civilians. Rather, it is by returning in good \r\nfaith to the negotiating table within a clear framework \r\nto achieve the two-State solution, with two States living \r\nside by side in peace, harmony, security, coexistence \r\nand cooperation. Morocco’s position on this conflict \r\nremains firm and is based on the Arab Peace Initiative, \r\nthe agreed terms of reference and the establishment of \r\nan independent State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital, within the 4 June 1967 borders.\r\nTherefore, the international community is now \r\nmore than ever called on to work to mobilize the peace \r\nprocess in accordance with the agreed time frame and \r\nbased on international foundations and principles. \r\nMorocco is ready to engage very actively with all \r\ninitiatives aimed at moving the peace process forward \r\nand arriving at a settlement that would achieve security \r\nand stability in the region.\r\nMr. Gallegos Chiriboga (Ecuador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We thank you, Madam President, for convening \r\nthis meeting on a date of particular significance to the \r\npeople of the State of Palestine and of Israel.\r\nOn 29 November 1947, the Assembly determined \r\nthe establishment of two States, Israel and Palestine. \r\nOn numerous occasions, my delegation and others \r\nparticipating in the regular open debates held by the \r\nSecurity Council on the question of Palestine have said \r\nthat our meetings are of an almost ritual nature. It is \r\nso, and it has become so. The date of 29 November is \r\na day not of celebration but of frustration and sadness \r\nbecause 71 years after it was made, that commitment \r\nhas not been fulfilled, and that failure can be measured \r\nin the lives of human beings and in deprivations of \r\nall kinds.\r\nIn those 71 years, my country has held an \r\nunwavering position and will continue to do so because \r\nit is a position of principle. We recognize all the efforts \r\nmade throughout those years by the various agencies \r\nof the United Nations, the special representatives and \r\ncoordinators, as well as the various Member States \r\ninvolved. We must also reiterate our call for an end to \r\nviolence, no matter where it comes from, and the need \r\nfor Palestinian reconciliation and genuine dialogue \r\nbetween Palestine and Israel.\r\nThe deplorable acts of violence and deprivation \r\npersist unchanged. The humanitarian crisis, food \r\ndependency, the destruction of infrastructure and the \r\ndeterioration of the living conditions of the Palestinians \r\ncontinue. We continue to observe violations of the \r\nnorms of international law, international humanitarian \r\nlaw and in particular the rights of Palestinian children. \r\nThat represents a complete failure to comply with \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2334 (2016), which remains \r\nthe only guarantee of the existence of two States.\r\nOn 24 December 2010, my country was one of \r\nthe first to recognize the State of Palestine, and we \r\nwent on to become a sponsor of resolution 67/19 of \r\n29 November 2012, which recognized Palestine’s new \r\nstatus as a non-member observer State. We therefore \r\nreiterate our full commitment to the spirit and nature \r\nof all the relevant General Assembly resolutions, which \r\nhave consistently upheld the inalienable rights of the \r\nPalestinian people, and our belief that any measures \r\ntaken by Israel, the occupying Power, to impose its \r\nlegislation, jurisdiction or administration in the holy \r\ncity of Jerusalem are illegal and consequently devoid \r\nof any validity.\r\nWe also support the ongoing work within the \r\nframework of the United Nations to ensure the right \r\nof all Palestinian refugees to return to their homes, \r\nas affirmed and provided for in numerous General \r\nAssembly resolutions, most recently resolution 72/81, \r\nadopted in December of last year. Ecuador urges the \r\ninternational community to make concrete progress \r\nin supporting a lasting, just political solution for both \r\nparties, based on the existence of two States, Palestine \r\nand Israel, as the only pathway to achieving peace and \r\nstability in the Middle East, assure the Palestinian \r\npeople of their full rights and realize the establishment \r\nof an independent State of Palestine incorporated into \r\nthe United Nations as a full-f ledged member, as set \r\nout in the 1947 resolution on the partition of Palestine \r\n(resolution 181 (II)).\r\n30/11/2018 A/73/PV.43\r\n18-40536 11/26\r\nFor those in the Assembly who like me have \r\nwitnessed countless meetings like this one over the past \r\nfew decades, I want to stress that solving this problem \r\nrequires a demonstration of political will on the part of \r\nmany stakeholders but above all a clear understanding \r\nthat peace is won in the hearts and minds of men, \r\nwomen and children, not at the point of a gun or a \r\nbomb. Let us pray that we will soon achieve peace in \r\nthe Middle East.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance \r\nwith General Assembly resolution 48/265 of 24 August \r\n1994, I call on the observer for the Sovereign Order \r\nof Malta.\r\nMr. De Rojas (Sovereign Order of Malta): I thank \r\nyou, Madam President, for giving us the opportunity \r\nto take the f loor to discuss these interconnected \r\nitems today.\r\nOne of the draft resolutions to be considered \r\naddresses the issue of Jerusalem (A/73/L.29), which is \r\ncentral to the question of Palestine. As the Assembly is \r\naware, Jerusalem is very dear to the Sovereign Order of \r\nMalta, as it is the place where the Order was founded, \r\nmore than 900 years ago, and where our first hospital \r\nwas built. The mission to care for the sick, the poor \r\nand the most vulnerable, regardless of their nationality, \r\nethnicity or religion, has remained the central purpose \r\nof the Order of Malta for more than nine centuries.\r\nLike many others, we believe that Jerusalem \r\nbelongs not to a single nation but rather to all of us, to \r\nhumankind as a whole. It is a city sacred to the world’s \r\nthree great monotheistic religions and has been a place \r\nof pilgrimage and inspiration for countless millions \r\nfor two millenniums. When the General Assembly \r\nfirst dealt with the question of Palestine in 1947, it \r\nvery wisely decided to set up a special international \r\nregime for the city of Jerusalem within the partition \r\nframework, to be administered by the United Nations. \r\nThe boundaries of what was called a corpus separatum \r\nwere even laid out in a detailed map that was attached \r\nto resolution 181 (II), of 29 November 1947.\r\nWe are therefore glad to see that the draft resolution \r\nbefore us recalls that resolution 181 (II) reaffirms \r\nthat the international community, through the United \r\nNations, has a legitimate interest in the question of \r\nJerusalem and the protection of the city’s unique \r\nspiritual, religious and cultural dimensions. We are also \r\nencouraged by its reiterations that a comprehensive, \r\njust and lasting solution to the question of the city of \r\nJerusalem should include internationally guaranteed \r\nprovisions aimed at ensuring the freedom of religion \r\nand conscience of its inhabitants, as well as permanent, \r\nfree and unhindered access to its holy places for people \r\nof all religions and nationalities.\r\nAs the representative of the Holy See expressed \r\nwhen he addressed the General Assembly on this subject \r\nin December of last year (see A/ES-10/PV.37), we \r\nbelieve that only an internationally guaranteed status \r\ncan preserve Jerusalem’s unique character and ensure \r\ndialogue and reconciliation for peace in the region. We \r\nsupport that view, and we welcome this new and timely \r\ninitiative by the General Assembly on the matter.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nI would like to inform members that the \r\nconsideration of draft resolutions A/73/L.31, A/73/L.32, \r\nA/73/L.33 and A/73/L.34 will take place following the \r\nconclusion of the debate on agenda item 38.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 39.\r\nAgenda item 38\r\nThe situation in the Middle East\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (А/73/322 and \r\nА/73/346)\r\nDraft resolutions (А/73/L.29 and A/73/L.30)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nf loor to the representative of Egypt to introduce draft \r\nresolutions А/73/L.29 and A/73/L.30.\r\nMr. Tayel (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The world \r\ntoday faces many humanitarian crises that are \r\nunfortunately concentrated in the Middle East, a region \r\nthat has recently been plagued by increasing instability. \r\nWe must bear in mind that one of the underlying causes \r\nof that instability is the decades of injustices done to \r\nthe Arab people during the more than 50 years of their \r\nsuffering under the yoke of occupation. There have been \r\nnumerous attempts to exploit the crises in the region \r\nin order to conceal the occupation of Arab territories, \r\nwhich runs counter to basic humanitarian principles \r\nand perpetuates an illegal situation whose adverse \r\neffects continue to reverberate all over the region \r\nand the world. The many years of the occupation’s \r\nexistence have led to the acceptance by some of its \r\npractices against people who are supposed to enjoy \r\nA/73/PV.43 30/11/2018\r\n12/26 18-40536\r\nthe same rights as all the other peoples of the world, \r\nespecially the right to freedom, self-determination and \r\nthe sense of belonging to a homeland. The international \r\ncommunity is firmly committed to the rights of the \r\nPalestinian and Syrian people. In the Assembly today, \r\nI am therefore introducing on behalf of their sponsors \r\ntwo draft resolutions under agenda item 38, entitled \r\n“The situation in the Middle East”.\r\nThe first draft resolution, entitled “Jerusalem” \r\n(A/73/L.29), stresses the importance as a reference of \r\nthe General Assembly and Security Council resolutions \r\nthat deal with the special status of occupied Jerusalem. \r\nThe draft resolution emphasizes that all measures \r\nundertaken by Israel, the occupying Power, to impose \r\nits administrative and judicial authority on the city \r\nof Jerusalem are illegal, null and void. In the draft \r\nresolution the international community expresses its \r\ngrave concern about the continuation of Israel’s illegal \r\nsettlement activities, including the plan known as E1, \r\nas well as the construction of the separation wall in and \r\naround the city of East Jerusalem, further isolating the \r\ncity from the rest of the Palestinian territories.\r\nAs we are committed to peace and to maintaining \r\nthe religious significance of the city of Jerusalem, the \r\ndraft resolution stresses the importance of taking into \r\naccount the legitimate concerns of both Palestinians \r\nand Israelis by providing international guarantees that \r\nensure religious freedom for the inhabitants of the city \r\nand free access to the holy sites for all, regardless of \r\ntheir religion or nationality. The draft resolution also \r\ncalls for respect in both word and deed for the historical \r\nstatus of the holy sites in Jerusalem, including the \r\nHoly Mosque.\r\nToday it is important to note the addition made to the \r\ndraft resolution this year emphasizing the importance \r\nof Jerusalem to the three monotheistic religions. We \r\nreiterate what we have stressed many times before, \r\nwhich is that the issue of Jerusalem and the Palestinian \r\nquestion as a whole is primarily a political, legal and \r\nhumanitarian issue, not a religious one. It can therefore \r\nbe resolved only through adherence to international \r\nlaw and the relevant United Nations resolutions, which \r\nrepresent the sole references to the relations among \r\nStates and peoples.\r\nThe second draft resolution, A/73/L.30, relates to \r\nthe Syrian Golan. We are once again introducing this \r\ndraft resolution in order to send an important message \r\nfrom the international community emphasizing that \r\nthe unprecedented humanitarian crisis in Syria that the \r\nSyrians are enduring should not make the world forget \r\nthat an important part of Syria is occupied, and that the \r\nSyrian people’s right to claim that occupied land will not \r\ndisappear with time or fail for any other reasons that our \r\nbrother people of Syria may face. The draft resolution \r\nstresses once again that 35 years after the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 497 (1981), Israel has still \r\nnot complied with its provisions. It makes reference to \r\nThe Hague Convention of 1907 and the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention of 1949 with regard to their applicability \r\nto the Syrian territories that have been occupied since \r\n1967. It also points to the illegality of the imposition of \r\nIsraeli laws on the Golan and of the Israeli settlements \r\nthere. It calls on Israel to completely withdraw from the \r\nGolan to the borders of 4 June 1967 and to uphold what \r\nhas already been achieved in that regard.\r\nThe people of the Middle East continue to suffer \r\nfrom the scourges of war and aggression and to aspire \r\nto achieving peace, stability and peaceful coexistence. \r\nFor decades, United Nations resolutions have been in \r\nplace that reflect those aspirations, which will come \r\ntrue only when we can demonstrate the political \r\ndetermination and serious commitment to ending the \r\noccupation of all the Palestinian and Arab territories, in \r\nline with the relevant General Assembly and Security \r\nCouncil resolutions as well as the principle of land for \r\npeace and international law.\r\nIn conclusion, on behalf of all the sponsors of the \r\ntwo draft resolutions as well as myself, I call on all \r\nMember States to support the two draft resolutions. I \r\nurge everyone in the Hall to vote for them with a view \r\nto preventing the elimination of people’s legal rights \r\nwhile stressing the strong will of the international \r\ncommunity and upholding the noble purposes and \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the Organization.\r\nMr. Mounzer (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I thank the representative of the Arab Republic \r\nof Egypt for introducing today’s draft resolutions \r\nA/73/L.30 and A/73/L.29, entitled “The Syrian Golan” \r\nand “Jerusalem”. I also thank all the sponsors of the \r\ndraft resolution on the Syrian Golan and those who vote \r\nin favour of it.\r\nThe General Assembly has considered the agenda \r\nitem on the situation in the Middle East every year \r\nsince its twenty-fifth session in 1970. In every session, \r\nthe Assembly has called on Israel to end its occupation \r\nof the Arab territories and affirmed that any measures \r\n30/11/2018 A/73/PV.43\r\n18-40536 13/26\r\ntaken by Israel, the occupying Power, to impose its \r\nlegislation, jurisdiction and administrative authority on \r\nthe city of Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan are illegal, \r\nillegitimate, null and void. The Assembly’s resolutions \r\nare fully aligned with the unanimous position of the \r\nSecurity Council in its resolutions 478 (1980), on \r\noccupied Jerusalem, and 497 (1981), on the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan, both of which reject the unilateral \r\nand provocative decisions of the Israeli occupying \r\nauthorities to annex occupied Palestinian Jerusalem \r\nand the Syrian Golan and consider those decisions \r\ndevoid of any legal standing.\r\nFor more than seven decades, Israel has been \r\noccupying Palestinian territories, thereby causing the \r\nsuffering of more than 5 million Palestinian refugees, \r\nwho have been expelled from their homeland and \r\nwhose land, homes and livelihoods have been seized \r\nby Israel, which has received support and protection \r\nfrom various States. That has enabled Israel to run \r\nrampant in the region, refusing to implement the \r\nhundreds of related resolutions adopted at the United \r\nNations throughout those decades. Israel has continued \r\nits expansion across vast areas of Palestinian and Arab \r\nterritories, perpetrating documented and systematic \r\ncrimes, aggressions and violations of both international \r\nhumanitarian law and international human rights \r\nlaw, all of which constitute war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity.\r\nMy country reiterates its firm and principled stance \r\nin support of the Palestinian people and their right to \r\nself-determination through the establishment of the \r\nindependent State of Palestine on the entirety of their \r\nnational land, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We \r\nsupport the right of refugees to return to their homeland, \r\nin accordance with resolution 194 (III) of 1948. Any \r\nmeasures that impede or undermine those rights are \r\nnull and void and should be rejected, as they represent \r\na threat to peace and security in the region and the \r\nworld. That is especially true of the racist law recently \r\nadopted by Israel known as the nation-State law, as well \r\nas the decision of the United States Administration to \r\nmove its Embassy to the city of Jerusalem and to stop \r\nfunding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency \r\nfor Palestine Refugees in the Near East.\r\nIsrael continues to occupy a precious part of our \r\nland in the Syrian Golan. Our people there continue \r\nto suffer as a consequence of Israel’s occupation and \r\nits oppressive and aggressive practices. From the very \r\nfirst day of its occupation, Israel has been attempting \r\nto change the legal and political status of the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan by perpetrating systematic violations of \r\nhuman rights, first by attempting since 1981 to impose \r\nIsraeli citizenship on our people there, and later through \r\nits absurd decision to hold farcical local elections in the \r\noccupied Syrian Golan on 30 October. All such efforts \r\nhave been thoroughly thwarted by our unfaltering \r\npeople in the area.\r\nIsrael continues to confiscate land in the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan, expanding its settlements there, looting \r\nits wealth, distorting its history, stealing its artefacts and \r\nplanting landmines, while also continuing to deprive the \r\nsteadfast Syrian citizens there of their right to remain in \r\ncontact with their families in their motherland of Syria. \r\nIsrael also deprives the Syrian citizens in the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan of their right to study according to Syria’s \r\nnational education curricula. They have been deprived \r\nof the right to carry their Syrian national identity cards \r\nand build Syrian national hospitals in their occupied \r\ntowns in the Golan. Furthermore, Israel continues \r\nto conduct its policies of terrorism, oppression, \r\nracial discrimination and arbitrary detention of \r\nSyrian citizens. It continues to make every aspect of \r\ntheir lives difficult, including their right, based on \r\ninternational laws and customs, to resist the occupation, \r\nand it continues to arrest them, try them in puppet \r\ncourts, sentence them to long periods of imprisonment \r\nand treat them as war criminals. In that connection, we \r\nshould remind the international community of Syria’s \r\nMandela, the prisoner Sedqi Suleiman Al-Maqet, whom \r\nthe Israeli occupation authorities re-arrested in March \r\n2015, after he had been imprisoned in Israeli jails for \r\n27 years. It sentenced him to an additional 14 years of \r\njail because he exposed through audio recordings and \r\nphotographs the fact that Israel, the occupying Power, \r\nwas cooperating with the terrorist organization Jabhat \r\nAl-Nusra and other terrorist organizations active \r\nthroughout the disengagement zone in the Golan. We \r\ncall on our global Organization not to delay in working \r\nto secure his release and that of the prisoner Amal Abu \r\nSaleh and the other prisoners arrested by Israel a few \r\ndays ago, after the local elections farce.\r\nMy country reaffirms its sovereign right to the \r\noccupied Syrian Golan, based on the borders of 4 June \r\n1967. That right is not open to negotiation or compromise \r\nor subject to a statute of limitations. Our occupied land \r\nand the rights we have been denied will be restored to \r\nus in full because we are the legitimate owners. Israel \r\nand its settlers must leave our land in the Golan sooner \r\nA/73/PV.43 30/11/2018\r\n14/26 18-40536\r\nor later. We stress that we will not forfeit our right to \r\nrecover our occupied land and liberate those of our \r\ncitizens who are suffering under Israeli occupation \r\nin the Syrian Golan, using any and every means, as \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in \r\naccordance with the principles of international law and \r\nUnited Nations resolutions.\r\nIn its resolution 497 (1981), the Security Council \r\nrequested the Secretary-General to report to it within \r\ntwo weeks on the implementation of the resolution, and \r\ndecided that in the event of Israel’s non-compliance, \r\nthe Council would meet without delay, and no later \r\nthan 5 January 1982, to consider taking appropriate \r\nmeasures in accordance with the Charter. Thirty-\r\nseven years later, and after the General Assembly’s \r\nadoption of dozens of resolutions confirming Israel’s \r\nnon-compliance with resolution 497 (1981), we have the \r\nright to ask what the Council is waiting for to implement \r\nits resolution and force Israel to end its occupation of \r\nthe Syrian Golan. What is the Council waiting for to \r\nput an end to Israel’s violations and aggression against \r\nthe territories of the Syrian Arab Republic, most \r\nrecently on 29 November in the Al-Kiswa area south of \r\nDamascus? That represented overwhelming evidence \r\nthat Israel has entered a new phase of State terrorism, \r\nas it is now competing with the terrorist organizations \r\nof Da’esh and Jabhat Al-Nusra to kill civilians.\r\nIt is no longer acceptable for the United Nations \r\nand its Member States to continue to address the \r\noppressive Israeli occupation routinely or without \r\nshowing solidarity that includes real steps that could \r\nlead to tangible results. The United Nations must \r\ntherefore take immediate action to put an end to Israel’s \r\noccupation and ensure its withdrawal from Arab \r\nterritories, including the occupied Syrian Golan, to the \r\n4 June 1967 lines, and to implement Security Council \r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 497 (1981).\r\nIn conclusion, I call on all States to vote in favour \r\nof draft resolution A/73/L.30, entitled “The Syrian \r\nGolan”, and all draft resolutions pertaining to Palestine.\r\nMs. Nuzuha (Maldives): The Middle East continues \r\nto capture the imagination of Maldivians, young and \r\nold alike, not because we are in the Middle East or even \r\nthe immediate neighbourhood, but because we care \r\nabout the suffering of so many innocent people who are \r\nbeing denied their right to life and basic human dignity, \r\neducation, sanitation and health care. We support a \r\nsettlement of the conflict in Palestine and call for an \r\nend to Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestine, which \r\nremains at the root of the unending cycles of violence \r\nand conflict in the entire region.\r\nThe Maldives has always believed that the \r\nestablishment of an independent and sovereign State of \r\nPalestine based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital, living side by side and in peace with Israel, \r\nis the only viable solution to the conflict in Palestine. \r\nThat is the solution called for by the Security Council, \r\nparticularly in its resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and \r\n2334 (2016). The Maldives therefore calls on Israel to \r\nfully implement the relevant Council resolutions, fully \r\nrespect the legal obligations it undertook in the Oslo \r\nAccords and implement the Arab Peace Initiative and \r\nthe Quartet road map.\r\nYet the question of Palestine remains unsettled \r\nand without meaningful progress. As recently as \r\nSeptember, Israel’s High Court rejected a petition to \r\nprevent the demolition of a village in the West Bank \r\nthat would result in the displacement of hundreds \r\nof people, leaving them homeless and without a \r\nlivelihood, a school for their children or access to \r\nbasic health care. That epitomizes the failure of the \r\ninternational system to bring an end to the suffering \r\nof the people of the Middle East. Today, we once again \r\njoin many countries in calling for a permanent end to \r\nthe unlawful occupation of Palestinian lands and for \r\ngranting the Palestinian people their legitimate right to \r\nself-determination.\r\nThe humanitarian situation continues to worsen \r\nin Syria, where the conflict is in its seventh year. The \r\nbattle in Aleppo reduced the country to rubble. The \r\nentire world now fears the outbreak of another conflict \r\nin Syria’s north-western Idlib province, which could \r\nresult in the worst humanitarian catastrophe of this \r\ncentury. Should it happen, more than 3 million people \r\nwould be displaced with nowhere to seek shelter, \r\nfood or access to health care. We therefore call on the \r\ninternational community to take more assertive steps \r\nto halt the tide of suffering in Syria. Humanitarian \r\nintervention is an absolute necessity, but a permanent \r\npolitical solution must be found.\r\nThe already dire situation in the Middle East is \r\nbeing exacerbated by terrorist groups such as Da’esh, \r\nwhich are inflicting destruction and imposing extreme \r\nsocial conditions through barbaric acts of violence \r\nand bloodshed. They do not recognize borders or \r\ndistinguish between young and old, women and \r\n30/11/2018 A/73/PV.43\r\n18-40536 15/26\r\nmen, nor do they respect any religion or culture. The \r\nMaldives condemns any attempt to attribute terrorism \r\nto any specific religion, culture or tradition. We are \r\nalso of the view that the factors of terrorism should be \r\ntackled through international cooperation focused on \r\ncombating violent extremism.\r\nIt is important that we rise above the shackles of \r\nthe past to move towards a promising future. This is \r\na compromise that must be made by the people and \r\nleaders of the countries of the region in order to save an \r\narea that has served as the cradle of human civilization \r\nand the birthplace of many early scientific and \r\ntechnological advances. The Maldives therefore stands \r\nready, full of hope, to work to find a lasting solution to \r\nthis conflict, for we believe that there is always room \r\nfor hope in any hardship.\r\nMr. Bessho (Japan): I thank you, Madam President, \r\nfor convening this important meeting. I would like to \r\naddress agenda items 38, “The situation in the Middle \r\nEast”, and 39, “Question of Palestine”, and with regard \r\nto the latter item, to take special note of the fact that \r\nyesterday was the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East remains volatile \r\nand complex. Its interlocking challenges require the \r\nsustained attention of the international community. \r\nIn Yemen, we need to make progress urgently, as \r\nmore than 14 million people run the risk of famine. In \r\nSyria, we have yet to see substantial and irreversible \r\nprogress on either the political or the humanitarian \r\nfront. Through it all, the Middle East peace process is \r\none of the central issues shaping international relations \r\nin the region. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict feeds \r\ninto wider regional dynamics, and the lack of concrete \r\nprogress is an obstacle to improving the relations \r\nbetween regional players. There is a diplomatic and \r\nsecurity cost to leaving that issue unresolved, and it \r\nis borne by all. The only way to achieve a solution to \r\nthat conflict is through direct negotiations between \r\nboth the parties. It is clear that a resumption of peace \r\ntalks is needed, but the current outlook remains bleak. \r\nThe international community, including the General \r\nAssembly, must continue to play its role in helping to \r\ncreate an environment conducive to peace. While there \r\nare many essential steps that will have to be taken, I \r\nwant to highlight three actions that the international \r\ncommunity can take now.\r\nFirst, building confidence among the parties \r\nrequires enhanced international support. We appreciate \r\nthe various efforts made so far by Member States and \r\nregional actors. For its part, Japan is committed to \r\ncontinuing its unique confidence-building measures \r\nthrough the Corridor for Peace and Prosperity initiative, \r\nwhich encourages and supports interdependence in \r\nthe region, and the independence of the Palestinian \r\neconomy, through regional cooperation with Palestine, \r\nJordan and Israel.\r\nSecondly, the international community must \r\nmaintain its strong support for a two-State solution. \r\nThat means not only by expressing political support \r\nbut also by rejecting any activity that makes the \r\npossibility of achieving that solution less likely. The \r\ncontinuing Israeli settlement activities are in violation \r\nof international law and must cease immediately. \r\nViolence also remains a major obstacle to peace. Japan \r\ncondemns all acts of violence, which are fundamentally \r\nincompatible with the peaceful resolution of conflicts. \r\nIn supporting a two-State solution, the international \r\ncommunity also has a role to play in upholding the \r\ninternationally agreed parameters, including on the \r\nstatus of Jerusalem.\r\nFinally, we must immediately alleviate the economic \r\nand humanitarian situation, which is particularly \r\ndire in Gaza. While we should swiftly implement the \r\npackage agreed on in the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee \r\nfor the Coordination of International Assistance to \r\nPalestinians, the return of the Palestinian Authority to \r\nGaza is crucial.\r\nIn terms of broader stabilization and security in \r\nthe Middle East and North Africa, let me briefly touch \r\non the Kono four principles, which Japan’s Foreign \r\nMinister Kono announced last year. The principles \r\nemphasize, first, intellectual and human contributions; \r\nsecondly, investment in people; thirdly, enduring \r\nefforts; and fourthly, enhanced political efforts. Japan \r\nhas been conducting several programmes with tangible \r\noutcomes, such as the Jericho Agro-Industrial Park in \r\nPalestine, which is in its tenth year of operation, and our \r\ncapacity-building initiative for teachers and instructors \r\nin the Middle East. We are committed to continuing \r\nthose efforts.\r\nJapan believes in what we can achieve through \r\nmultilateral efforts at the United Nations. The \r\ninternational community, including the Assembly, must \r\nwork in a way that creates a positive atmosphere for \r\nA/73/PV.43 30/11/2018\r\n16/26 18-40536\r\npeace rather than feeding divisions. Japan will continue \r\nto engage constructively to that end.\r\nMr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Russia and the countries of the Middle East are \r\nlinked by many decades of friendship and constructive, \r\nmutually beneficial cooperation. Our relations have \r\nwithstood the test of time. We are genuinely interested \r\nin restoring stability in the region as soon as possible. \r\nHowever, the reality today is such that the situation in \r\nthe Middle East remains difficult and still demands \r\nsignificant collective efforts. Only through broad-based \r\ncooperation and multilateral diplomacy can we make \r\nprogress in resolving the acute crises in the region and \r\ndefeating terrorism.\r\nWe firmly believe that developing a shared vision \r\nof ways to make progress towards stabilization and \r\nnormalization in the Middle East is possible despite the \r\ndifferences in our approaches. The joint actions of the \r\nguarantor countries of the Astana process have proved \r\nthat, and we are open to everyone who wants to be \r\ninvolved in such efforts. Working together, we can do a \r\ngreat deal to improve the situation in the Middle East. \r\nUnited in the broadest possible front, something that \r\nRussia’s President Vladimir Putin has called for, we \r\ncan make real breakthroughs in combating terrorism. \r\nTogether, we can end the bloodshed in Yemen, stabilize \r\nLibya, help Syrian refugees return home, tackle the \r\nchallenge of global migration, support normalization \r\nin Iraq and resolve other crises. The countries of the \r\nregion possess a wealth of the cultural, human and \r\nnatural potential that can enable them to develop \r\nsustainably and even f lourish. But that potential will be \r\nfully realized only when interference in the domestic \r\naffairs of States in the Middle East ends. Like other \r\nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law, the principle of non-intervention \r\nmust be respected. We see a firm foundation in that \r\nstrict respect for our collective quest to resolve crises, \r\nfirst and foremost through the United Nations and its \r\nSecurity Council, which are the fundamental guarantors \r\nof today’s international legal system.\r\nWe will not accept aggressive revisionism \r\naimed at various international agreements originally \r\narrived at based on the relevant Security Council and \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions, among other things. \r\nSuch dangerous attempts not only negate earlier \r\nefforts to resolve conflicts, they also undermine \r\nour Organization’s authority and generally erode \r\ninternational law. We should focus all our efforts not \r\non unilateral revisionist policies but on intensifying \r\nmediation, with the United Nations taking a leading \r\nrole in order to launch or rekindle dialogue mechanisms \r\nfor settling the crises at the centre of which lies the \r\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict, whose resolution is key to \r\nimproving the situation throughout the region.\r\nUnfortunately, destabilizing trends are still \r\ndominant in the occupied Palestinian territories, \r\nand the prospects for a resumption of the negotiation \r\nprocess are becoming increasingly remote. The gulf of \r\nmisunderstanding and mistrust between Palestinians \r\nand Israelis is widening. Instead of calls for peace and \r\npeaceful initiatives, what is now in the forefront is \r\nviolence, unilateral measures, inflammatory rhetoric \r\nand attempts to create new facts on the ground, \r\ndamaging the possibility of a settlement. The tension \r\ncontinues around the Gaza Strip, where just recently, \r\nthanks to monumental efforts, a relative calm has been \r\nachieved. We hope that it can be sustained and long-\r\nterm, and that it will give the international community \r\na chance to revitalize efforts to address the appalling \r\nhumanitarian situation and focus on advancing the \r\npolitical process. Of course, any assistance to Gaza \r\nshould be conducted in close coordination with the \r\nlegitimate Palestinian authorities under President \r\nAbbas, and should align with efforts to resolve the \r\nproblem of restoring Palestinian unity.\r\nRussia’s position has remained consistent. A \r\ncomprehensive, sustainable Arab-Israeli settlement and \r\nresolution of the Palestinian question can be achieved \r\non an internationally recognized basis that includes the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative and the Madrid principles, including the \r\nprinciple of land for peace in relation to all the occupied \r\nterritories, among them the Syrian Golan. A crucial \r\ninstrument in the settlement is still the concept of a two-\r\nState solution, which assumes the establishment in the \r\nregion, as a result of negotiations, of a State of Palestine \r\ncoexisting in peace and security alongside Israel. Any \r\npolicy aimed at creating new facts on the ground is \r\nunacceptable, and we consider the expansion of Israeli \r\nsettlements, the demolition of Palestinian property \r\nand the expulsion of Palestinian families unlawful. \r\nWe condemn all forms of violence and inflammatory \r\nrhetoric. We believe that only a direct dialogue between \r\nPalestinians and Israelis can make it possible to find \r\nanswers to all the final-status issues. That applies to \r\nJerusalem, refugees, borders and core regional security \r\nissues. We cannot simply pick up those sensitive \r\n30/11/2018 A/73/PV.43\r\n18-40536 17/26\r\nproblems and take them off the negotiating table before \r\nthe parties have discussed them.\r\nRussia will continue to play an active role in the \r\nMiddle East in its capacity as a permanent member of \r\nthe Security Council and a member of the Middle East \r\nQuartet of international mediators, which remains the \r\nonly mediation format approved by Security Council \r\nresolutions. The proposal for convening a summit \r\nin Russia between the leaders of Palestine and Israel \r\nremains on the table. We will continue to assist the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA) financially and \r\npolitically. UNRWA’s operations are of key significance, \r\nas they have an important stabilizing effect in the \r\nPalestinian territories and the countries of the Middle \r\nEast. The Agency must endure and be fully functional.\r\nThe Russian Federation supports the development \r\nof a positive, unifying agenda for the entire international \r\ncommunity on the Middle East, including Palestine. \r\nWhat will be crucial to our combined efforts in the \r\nregion is establishing conditions that are conducive to \r\nstrengthening a general atmosphere of trust. That has \r\nkey significance for the relations between the Arab \r\nStates, Israel and Iran. We want to remind the Assembly \r\nthat in resolution 598 (1987), the Security Council \r\nrequested the Secretary-General to work with States in \r\nthe region to come up with measures to enhance the \r\nsecurity and stability of the region. That is not easy, \r\nbut we have to start work on it. Russia is willing to \r\nmake every effort to assist all our regional partners, \r\nwithout exception. Our ultimate goal must be to create \r\na genuinely inclusive regional security architecture that \r\ncan encompass every State in that part of the world. \r\nOur concept for strengthening security in the Persian \r\nGulf through international guarantees is still relevant \r\nand its implementation could begin with the holding of \r\na conference with the participation of the States in the \r\nsubregion. Over the long term, it could be expanded to \r\ninclude other Middle Eastern States.\r\nWe want to emphasize that all the decisions taken \r\nby the General Assembly on this issue have to follow \r\nthe logic of resolving these problems. Russia stands \r\nready to work with all interested parties on an open and \r\nimpartial basis on all these and other aspects.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nI would like to inform members that we will take \r\naction on draft resolutions A/73/L.29 and A/73/L.30 \r\nafter doing so on draft resolutions A/73/L.31, \r\nA/73/L.32, A/73/L.33 and A/73/L.34, submitted under \r\nagenda item 39.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 38.\r\nAgenda item 39 (continued)\r\nQuestion of Palestine\r\nDraft resolutions (A/73/L.31, A/73/L.32, \r\nА/73/L.33 and А/73/L.34)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Before the \r\nAssembly takes action on the draft resolutions one \r\nby one, members are reminded that they will have \r\nan opportunity to explain their vote on all four draft \r\nresolutions either before or after action is taken on all \r\nof them.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolutions \r\nA/73/L.31, A/73/L.32, A/73/L.33 and A/73/L.34.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in explanation \r\nof vote before the voting, I would like to remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote should be limited \r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Kickert (Austria): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and \r\nits member States. The EU would like to thank the \r\nPalestinian delegation for the successful outcome of \r\nour negotiations on a number of the draft resolutions on \r\nwhich the General Assembly is now taking action. As \r\nan outcome of those negotiations, the EU confirms its \r\nposition on the package.\r\nAt this time, we would like to put it on record that \r\nwith regard to all draft resolutions adopted during the \r\nseventy-third session of the General Assembly, the \r\nEU and its member States consider that whenever the \r\nPalestinian Government is mentioned, it refers to the \r\nPalestinian Authority. Furthermore, the use of the term \r\n“Palestine” in any of those draft resolutions cannot be \r\nconstrued as recognition of a State of Palestine and \r\nis without prejudice to the individual positions of our \r\nmember States on that issue and hence on the question \r\nof the validity of an accession to the conventions and \r\ntreaties it mentions. We also point out that the European \r\nUnion as a whole has not expressed a legal qualification \r\nwith regard to the term “forced displacement”, used in \r\nA/73/PV.43 30/11/2018\r\n18/26 18-40536\r\na number of draft resolutions submitted under agenda \r\nitem 39.\r\nSome of the draft resolutions to be adopted today \r\nrefer to the holy sites in Jerusalem. The EU is concerned \r\nabout the worrying developments and recurrent violent \r\nclashes at the Temple Mount/Al-Haram Al-Sharif. The \r\nEU recalls the special significance of the holy sites and \r\ncalls for upholding the status quo put in place in 1967 \r\nfor the Temple Mount/Al-Haram Al-Sharif, in line with \r\nprevious understandings and with respect to Jordan’s \r\nspecial role. The EU recalls that its position with regard \r\nto those draft resolutions does not imply a change in \r\nits stance on the terminology concerning the Temple \r\nMount/Al-Haram Al-Sharif. The EU stresses the need \r\nfor language on the holy sites of Jerusalem to reflect \r\nthe importance and historical significance of the holy \r\nsites for the three monotheistic religions and to respect \r\nreligious and cultural sensitivities. The future choice \r\nof language may affect the EU’s collective support \r\nfor the draft resolutions according to the established \r\nvoting pattern.\r\nMrs. Furman (Israel): This explanation of vote \r\nrefers to all the draft resolutions under agenda items \r\n38 and 39. On 29 November 1947, the United Nations \r\nadopted resolution 181 (II), which called for the creation \r\nof independent Arab and Jewish States living side by \r\nside. The State of Israel accepted that resolution, and \r\nthe Arab world rejected it. On 15 May 1948, only one \r\nday after Israel declared its independence, a coalition of \r\nArab armies invaded Israel. Their goal was simple — to \r\ndestroy the newly established Jewish State.\r\nYesterday, 29 November, was the seventy-first \r\nanniversary of that crucial United Nations vote (see \r\nA/PV.128). It should have been a day of celebration, but \r\nyear after year, that historic date becomes an annual \r\nIsrael-bashing session. Some countries still refuse to \r\naccept the existence of the State of Israel in the Middle \r\nEast. We heard some of them speak yesterday (see \r\nA/73/PV.42) and earlier today.\r\nWe are living at a time when many crises are \r\nraging across the Middle East and around the world. It \r\nis a shame that rather than addressing those crises, the \r\nUnited Nations adopts so many biased resolutions and \r\ndevotes precious resources to politicized bodies whose \r\nsole purpose is to attack and denounce Israel.\r\nOne of those bodies is the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople — a Committee that does nothing but spread a \r\none-sided political narrative against one United Nations \r\nMember State and uses the money of all Member States \r\nto do so. Earlier this week, the Committee invited a \r\nguest speaker who suggested that solidarity from \r\nthe international community requires embracing the \r\nboycott, divestment and sanctions movement against \r\nIsrael. He concluded his statement with a call for a free \r\nPalestine from the river to the sea. For those who are \r\nnot familiar with the map of the region, there is only \r\none meaning to what he suggested — a Palestinian \r\nState, not side by side with Israel but instead of Israel.\r\nThe Division for Palestinian Rights supports that \r\nCommittee. Last year, the Division invited several \r\norganizations and speakers with clear and public ties \r\nto terrorism to participate in the Committee’s events. \r\nLet me repeat that. A body of the Secretariat funded \r\nby all Member States provided a platform for public \r\nsupporters and glorifiers of terrorism. That is not just a \r\nbad use of our time but is completely against our values. \r\nIt is truly disturbing and shameful.\r\nThat is not all. The Division for Palestinian Rights \r\nis the only office of the Secretariat promoting an agenda \r\nthat directly targets one Member State, and it fills 15 \r\npaid positions to do so. Moreover, a large portion of the \r\nfunding for the Division covers business-class airline \r\ntickets so that participants in its anti-Israel events can \r\ntravel anywhere in the world to attend. That type of \r\nDivision and funding at the United Nations is truly \r\nunparalleled, especially as the Department of Political \r\nAffairs struggles to tackle its endless responsibilities \r\nwith limited human and financial resources.\r\nI turn now to the special information programme \r\non the question of Palestine, led by the Department of \r\nPublic Information (DPI), which organizes an annual \r\nseminar on peace in the Middle East. No one should be \r\nmisled by the title — the seminar has nothing to do with \r\npeace. It has everything to do with anti-Israel sentiment \r\nand does little to promote dialogue and understanding \r\nbetween Israelis and Palestinians. This year’s seminar \r\nhad a panel entitled “Seventy years after Nakba day”. \r\nThe term “Nakba” means catastrophe. By adopting that \r\nterm at the seminar, the special information programme \r\nof the DPI is endorsing the Palestinians’ denial of \r\nIsrael’s legitimacy. Let me be clear — calling the \r\nestablishment of Israel a catastrophe is not a statement \r\nof solidarity with the Palestinians; it is a denial of \r\nIsrael’s right to exist.\r\n30/11/2018 A/73/PV.43\r\n18-40536 19/26\r\nThere is no way to justify the fact that the United \r\nNations spends almost $6.5 million of its budget on \r\norganizations and bodies that do nothing but try to \r\nisolate Israel. Not only are they one-sided, but they are \r\ndangerous and give the f loor to those who work against \r\na peaceful solution.\r\nThe problem does not end with the allocation of \r\nUnited Nations funding. It continues with the draft \r\nresolutions on which we will vote today. Two of them \r\ndiscuss the Temple Mount, a sacred place for all three \r\nmonotheistic religions: Islam, Christianity and Judaism. \r\nYet those draft resolutions have omitted any reference \r\nto the Jewish or Christian connection to the Temple \r\nMount, or, as we call it in Hebrew, Har Habayit. That \r\nomission is deliberate. It shows yet another instance \r\nof the Palestinians’ refusal to recognize the proven \r\nhistorical connection between Judaism, Christianity, \r\nthe Temple Mount and Jerusalem as a whole. The \r\ninternational community must stop participating in \r\nsuch a blatant denial of history. It must not permit such \r\nblatant attempts to delegitimize Israel.\r\nAs for the draft resolution regarding the Golan \r\n(A/73/L.30), the situation in Syria is dire. For the past \r\nseven years, the Syrian regime has been systematically \r\nkilling its own people and has even used chemical \r\nweapons against them. Meanwhile, Israel has been \r\ntaking care of thousands of injured Syrians in its \r\nhospitals. Yet, despite the realities on the ground, \r\nabsurdity prevails in the General Assembly.\r\nSupporting the six anti-Israel draft resolutions \r\npresented today will neither advance nor inspire peace. \r\nIt will only inspire hate. Israel will vote against them \r\nand I call on everyone to do the same.\r\nMr. Ordeman (United States of America): This \r\nexplanation of vote addresses all draft resolutions under \r\nagenda items 38 and 39.\r\nThe United States continues to oppose the annual \r\nsubmission of a disproportionate number of unfair draft \r\nresolutions biased against Israel. As in the past, this \r\none-sided approach damages the prospects for peace \r\nby undermining trust between the parties and failing \r\nto create the kind of positive international environment \r\nthat is critical to achieving peace.\r\nWe are disappointed that, despite messages of \r\nsupport for reform, Member States continue to single \r\nout Israel with such draft resolutions. As the United \r\nStates has repeatedly made clear, that dynamic is \r\nunacceptable. Again, we see draft resolutions that are \r\nquick to condemn all manner of Israeli actions but say \r\nalmost nothing about Palestinian terrorist attacks against \r\ninnocent civilians. That is particularly acute now, when \r\nthe rocket attacks of 12 November saw more projectiles \r\nfired on a single day than on any day since 2014. That \r\nis also why, for the first time, we are introducing a \r\nstand-alone draft resolution to condemn Hamas and \r\nother militant groups for their indiscriminate attacks \r\non civilians and their primary role in the worsening \r\nhumanitarian and economic situation in Gaza, as well \r\nas their actions to restrict free expression and silence \r\npolitical dissent.\r\nRegarding the draft resolutions subject to a vote \r\non 29 and 30 November, the United States will once \r\nagain vote against those one-sided draft resolutions \r\nand encourages other nations to do so as well. Those \r\ndraft resolutions damage the credibility of the United \r\nNations, as they show a clear bias in favour of one party \r\nand raise real questions regarding the impartiality of \r\nthe United Nations. That, in turn, serves to discredit \r\nthe Organization’s important role in supporting the \r\nresolution of the conflict in the Middle East.\r\nIn particular, the United States has significant \r\nconcerns with draft resolutions A/73/L.31 and A/73/L.34, \r\n“Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights \r\nof the Palestinian People” and “Division for Palestinian \r\nRights of the Secretariat”, respectively. Those two \r\ndraft resolutions have actual budgetary implications \r\nand consume limited United Nations resources that \r\nwould be better deployed elsewhere. Last year, the \r\noperations of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian people and the \r\nDivision for Palestinian Rights cost nearly $3 million. \r\nThose two draft resolutions propagate assumptions \r\nregarding issues that the parties have agreed should be \r\nresolved in the context of final status negotiations and \r\ndo nothing to bring us closer to the goal we all share \r\nof a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Instead, \r\nthey undermine our efforts by renewing the mandates \r\nof entities that perpetuate a clear and demonstrated bias \r\nthat serves only to drive the parties further apart.\r\nThe Palestinians are the only actor in the United \r\nNations system with a dedicated Division within \r\nthe Secretariat. The message that sends is that the \r\nPalestinians never really need to come back to the \r\nnegotiating table. They can rely on f lawed and biased \r\nmechanisms such as these to push their agenda. \r\nThe United States remains firmly and consistently \r\nA/73/PV.43 30/11/2018\r\n20/26 18-40536\r\ncommitted to achieving a comprehensive and lasting \r\npeace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\r\nAny resolution adopted here today will only distract \r\nfrom that process. One-sided resolutions do not help to \r\nadvance peace. The cause of peace will be served when \r\nthe bias of the United Nations against Israel ends. The \r\nUnited States has consistently opposed every effort \r\nto delegitimize Israel or undermine its security at the \r\nUnited Nations, and we will continue to do so with \r\nvigour. We hope that other Members will join us by \r\nvoting against these draft resolutions.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in explanation of vote before the

A/73/PV.43\r\n18-40536 25/26\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.30 was adopted 99 votes to \r\n10, with 66 abstentions (resolution 73/23).\r\n[Subsequently, the delegation of Angola informed \r\nthe Secretariat that it had intended to vote in favour.]\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Before giving \r\nthe f loor for explanations of vote after the vote, may I \r\nremind delegations that explanations of vote are limited \r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Duque Estrada Meyer (Brazil) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I have the honour to take the f loor on behalf \r\nof the delegations of Brazil and Argentina to explain \r\nour votes.\r\nAs we have done in previous years, with respect to \r\nresolution 73/23, concerning the Syrian Golan, which \r\nthe General Assembly has just adopted, Brazil and \r\nArgentina voted in favour of the resolution because we \r\nbelieve that its vital nature is linked to the illegality \r\nof the acquisition of territories by force. Article 2, \r\nparagraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nprohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial \r\nintegrity of any State.\r\nI would also like to clarify the position of \r\nour delegations with respect to paragraph 6 of the \r\nresolution. Our vote is without prejudice to the content \r\nof that paragraph, particularly the reference to 4 June \r\n1967. Brazil and Argentina believe that it is important \r\nto make progress in the search for a solution to the \r\nSyrian-Israeli aspect of the conflict in the Middle East \r\nwith the aim of putting an end to the occupation of the \r\nGolan Heights. Hence, on behalf of the Governments of \r\nBrazil and Argentina, I again highlight the importance \r\nof resuming negotiations to find a definitive solution to \r\nthe situation in the Syrian Golan, pursuant to Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the \r\nprinciple of land for peace.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nf loor to the observer of the Observer State of Palestine.\r\nMr. Mansour (Palestine): On behalf of the \r\ndelegation of the State of Palestine, allow me to express \r\nour gratitude and thanks to all the countries that voted \r\nin favour of the five resolutions related to the question \r\nof Palestine and also in favour of resolution 73/23, \r\nconcerning the Syrian Golan. We see that massive \r\nsupport, which is similar to last year’s pattern of voting, \r\nas a sign of the strong support of the international \r\ncommunity for the global consensus on how to solve \r\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the question of \r\nPalestine. We sincerely thank the Assembly for its \r\nsteadfastness, resolve and determination in ensuring \r\nthat the global consensus for which we have all worked, \r\nfor a long period of time, is still the cornerstone to \r\nfinding a just and lasting peace to this conflict. That \r\nwill give us the strength to remain steadfast in our \r\nhomeland and to seek a peaceful, just solution to this \r\nconflict on the basis of international law and all relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions on the subject. We thank the \r\nMember States for that.\r\nTo those who are advocating a stand-alone \r\nresolution, which to my understanding will be dealt with \r\nnext Thursday afternoon, let me just ask — after the \r\n16 resolutions that have been adopted in the committees \r\nand in the General Assembly, why submit this draft \r\nresolution? Are their intentions truly to open doors \r\nfor peace, or are their intentions disruptive and \r\nirresponsible and an attempt to distract us from pushing \r\nforward to find a solution to this conflict on the basis \r\nof what we have agreed to over the years, namely, the \r\nglobal consensus on the basis of a two-State solution \r\nbased on the borders of 1967, with East Jerusalem as \r\nthe capital of our State? That would require, of course, \r\nputting an end to the Israeli occupation that has lasted \r\nfor almost 51 years.\r\nWe believe that those who are advocating this \r\ninitiative are not acting out of a genuine wish to open \r\ndoors for peace. After all, they are the ones who \r\nunleashed a massive barrage of attacks against us, \r\nstarting with violating Security Council resolutions, \r\nrecognizing Jerusalem as the capital of the State of \r\nIsrael, moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, \r\nand the most recent attacks against us for nothing that \r\nwas done from our side. We simply come to the General \r\nAssembly to seek a legal, political, diplomatic solution \r\nto the conflict; yet they punish us for doing so. The \r\nlatest episode of such punishment is the free, stand-\r\nalone draft resolution.\r\nOf course, we refuted the argument of those who are \r\nadvancing this draft resolution, and we have circulated \r\nour argument refuting their argument to the entire \r\nAssembly. There is therefore no need for me to dwell \r\non that. However, I appeal to the Assembly to read our \r\nmemorandum and the annex thereto with regard to this \r\nfree, stand-alone draft resolution. Therefore, I appeal to \r\nall members, when that draft resolution is put to a vote \r\nnext Thursday, to vote against it and to defend the global \r\nconsensus to which we have agreed, as reflected in the \r\nA/73/PV.43 30/11/2018\r\n26/26 18-40536\r\npackage of resolutions, especially the 13 political ones \r\nwhose language we negotiated with all members. We \r\nare grateful that States voted in favour of the package.\r\nThe stand-alone draft resolution is trying to tell \r\nall of us that the global consensus on how to resolve \r\nthis issue is no more and is not acceptable, and that \r\nwhat is acceptable is only the draft resolution that they \r\nare pushing, which names and shames and shows no \r\nseriousness or genuineness about opening doors for \r\npeace. I therefore appeal to members and ask that when \r\nthat draft resolution is put to a vote, they vote against it \r\nbecause voting against it means that the Assembly still \r\nupholds the global consensus on how to resolve this \r\nsituation. I hope that next Thursday, my delegation will \r\nbe able to thank the Assembly in the same way as I am \r\nthanking it now for upholding the global consensus on \r\nresolving the question of Palestine.\r\nI want to thank you, Madam President, and your \r\nOffice for working with us to have an equal, reasonable \r\namount of time for all parties to be able to deal with \r\nwhat we must deal with next Thursday afternoon.\r\nMr. Mounzer (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My delegation would like to express its sincere \r\nappreciation and gratitude to the General Assembly for \r\nhaving once again, and without interruption since 1981, \r\nadopted the resolution entitled “The Syrian Golan” \r\n(resolution 73/23), as well as for having adopted the \r\nother resolutions submitted under the two agenda items \r\nconcerning the Palestinian question and the situation in \r\nthe Middle East.\r\nI reiterate my country’s gratitude to all the States \r\nthat sponsored and voted in favour of the resolution \r\nregarding the Syrian Golan. The majority of States \r\nMembers of the United Nations continues to support \r\nthose resolutions, which reflects their tenacious \r\nadherence to the objectives and purposes of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, their rejection of foreign \r\noccupation and their support for our right to regain \r\nevery inch of our territories that have been occupied by \r\nIsrael since 1967.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The General \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 38.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
