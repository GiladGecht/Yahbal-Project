(Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Ke (Cambodia), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 12\r\nSport for development and peace\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/73/325)\r\nDraft resolution (A/73/L.36)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Tunisia to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.36.\r\nMr. Khiari (Tunisia) (spoke in French): Draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.36 highlights the importance of sport \r\nas a crucial vehicle for development, social cohesion, \r\npeace and solidarity among peoples. Resolution 70/1, \r\nadopted by the Assembly on 25 September 2015, \r\nstipulates in paragraph 37:\r\n“Sport is also an important enabler of \r\nsustainable development. We recognize the \r\ngrowing contribution of sport to the realization of \r\ndevelopment and peace in its promotion of tolerance \r\nand respect and the contributions it makes to the \r\nempowerment of women and of young people, \r\nindividuals and communities as well as to health, \r\neducation and social inclusion objectives.”\r\nIt is in that spirit that, among other things, this year’s \r\ndraft resolution recognizes the importance of adopting \r\ncomprehensive approaches towards health and regular \r\nphysical activity, including sport and leisure, in order \r\nto prevent and control non-communicable diseases and \r\npromote healthy lifestyles.\r\nThe draft resolution also welcomes the memorandum \r\nof understanding signed in April 2014 between the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee and the United \r\nNations and affirms that the Olympic and Paralympic \r\nmovements make an invaluable contribution by \r\nestablishing sport as a unique means of promoting \r\npeace and development. It also duly reflects the roles \r\nof UNESCO and UN-Women and the importance \r\nof partnerships.\r\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child, the \r\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, \r\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nDiscrimination against Women and the International \r\nConvention against Doping in Sport are important tools \r\nin the context of sport for development and peace.\r\nThe draft resolution also refers to the UNESCO \r\nKazan Action Plan and the World Health Assembly \r\nGlobal Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018-\r\n2030. The Kazan Action Plan and its sport policy \r\nfollow-up framework, adopted at the sixth UNESCO \r\nInternational Conference of Ministers and Senior \r\nOfficials Responsible for Physical Education and \r\nSport, together provide a crucial frame of reference \r\nbased on voluntary activities that seeks to encourage \r\ninternational harmonization among decision-makers in \r\nthe areas of physical education, physical activity and \r\nsport, as well as a tool for synchronizing international \r\nand national policies in those areas.\r\n18-40542 (E)\r\n*1840542*\r\nA/73/PV.44 03/12/2018\r\n2/12 18-40542\r\nThe draft resolution encourages Member States, \r\nUnited Nations entities, including peacekeeping \r\nmissions, special political missions and integrated \r\npeacebuilding missions, sports organizations, \r\nfederations and associations, athletes, the media, civil \r\nsociety, universities and the private sector to make \r\nuse of those tools, where possible, in a coherent and \r\nintegrated way to give sport a more decisive role in \r\nintersectoral strategies relating to development and \r\npeace and to integrate sport and physical education \r\ninto international, regional and national policies \r\nand programmes.\r\nFinally, the draft resolution calls on the relevant \r\nentities of the United Nations system and other \r\ninternational and regional organizations, within \r\ntheir respective mandates and existing resources, to \r\nstrengthen and systematize inter-agency collaboration, \r\nin line with the updated United Nations Action Plan on \r\nSport for Development and Peace, in order to maximize \r\nthe potential of sport and physical activity to contribute \r\nto the achievement of the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the goals and targets of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and \r\nnational peacebuilding and State-building priorities.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to underscore that, as \r\nthe main co-sponsors, the delegations of my country \r\nand of Monaco worked to maintain consensus around \r\nthis draft resolution. In that regard, I would like to \r\nexpress the appreciation of my delegation and that \r\nof Monaco for the quality of the fruitful discussions \r\nand exchanges throughout the process of informal \r\nconsultations, as well as the great f lexibility shown by \r\nvarious delegations. We express our gratitude to all the \r\ntraditional co-sponsors and the new co-sponsors for \r\ntheir renewed support to the draft resolution.\r\nI could not conclude my remarks without expressing \r\nmy heartfelt thanks to Ms. Daniela Bas, Director of the \r\nDivision for Inclusive Social Development, and her \r\nteam, with whom we worked very closely throughout \r\nthe consultation process.\r\nMr. Stone (Australia): Australia thanks the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/73/325).\r\nAustralia supports efforts to use sport as an enabler \r\nfor development and peace. We recognize the important \r\nrole that sport plays in bringing people and communities \r\ntogether and in providing opportunities for inclusion \r\nwhile also fostering community pride. Sport also teaches \r\nimportant life skills such as leadership, teamwork, \r\nrespecting rules, discipline and perseverance.\r\nAustralia is firmly committed to promoting an \r\ninclusive environment and supporting participation \r\nregardless of ability, gender, race, religion, \r\nsocioeconomic status, ethnicity and age. To support \r\nthat, Australia has invested in national policies and \r\ninitiatives to promote diversity in physical activity and \r\nhealthy living in all segments of the population at all \r\nlevels of sport.\r\nAustralia has promoted inclusivity at the major \r\ninternational sporting events that we have hosted, such \r\nas the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, which \r\nhas been recognized as the most inclusive and accessible \r\nmajor sporting event in history. Australia’s para-athletes \r\nare some of the most celebrated and recognizable \r\nathletes and have a particular ability to motivate and \r\ninspire the nation. For the first time in history, the 2018 \r\nCommonwealth Games included the full integration of \r\npara-sports in the competition schedule and an equal \r\nnumber of medals for men and women.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nnote that today is the International Day of Persons \r\nwith Disabilities, and an important reminder of the \r\ncontribution of sport to helping to promote inclusivity \r\nfor all.\r\nAustralia is working in partnership with our \r\nmajor sporting codes to help to break down barriers \r\nto integration and inclusion in migrant communities \r\nto deliver a number of community programmes across \r\nthe country.\r\nAustralia is currently in the process of renewing \r\nits Sports Diplomacy Strategy, and supporting sport \r\nfor development will remain one of our strategic \r\npriorities. Australia takes pride in using sport to help \r\ndeveloping countries in our region to achieve positive \r\neconomic and social results within their communities. \r\nWe are also working to deliver stronger development \r\noutcomes through partnerships throughout the Pacific \r\nthrough the Sport for Development programme and the \r\nAustralia Pacific Sports Linkages programme. Those \r\nprogrammes aim to strengthen sporting ties with our \r\nvalued neighbours across the Pacific, with a particular \r\nfocus on championing women to be active.\r\nAustralia supports the Secretary-General’s \r\nrecommendations to further work on sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace at all levels and to promote \r\n03/12/2018 A/73/PV.44\r\n18-40542 3/12\r\npolicy coherence. Australia’s commitment to the United \r\nNations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nthe implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) offer new significance for sport \r\ninclusion. Through its role on the Commonwealth \r\nAdvisory Board on Sport and at the Commonwealth \r\nSports Ministers Meeting, Australia has identified \r\nkey areas where sport can contribute to advancing the \r\nSDGs. Australia’s involvement in research into the \r\ncontribution that sport can make to achieving the SDGs \r\nbrings depth and credibility to the place of sport as a \r\nvehicle for improving inclusion outcomes across the \r\nareas of health, education, social cohesion, business \r\nand leadership development at home as well as in our \r\nimmediate neighbourhood.\r\nEarlier this year, Australia delivered the first-ever \r\nNational Sports Plan: Sport 2030. The Plan outlines \r\na number of initiatives to promote and inspire more \r\nAustralians to be more active more often. That includes \r\nspecific programmes centred around providing \r\nopportunities to women to assist in overcoming cultural \r\nbarriers and enabling women, from the grassroots to \r\nthe elite, to become leaders in their sporting fields.\r\nWe also remain focused on promoting the importance \r\nof physical activity to an ageing demographic. We have \r\nin place a number of initiatives to encourage older \r\nAustralians to engage in sport. Our Play by the Rules \r\ninitiative also provides information, resources, tools \r\nand free online training to assist coaches, officials, \r\nplayers and spectators in preventing and dealing with \r\ndiscrimination, harassment, child safety, inclusion and \r\nintegrity issues in sport. Play by the Rules guides grass-\r\nroots sports clubs and organizations to be inclusivity \r\nchampions in their communities and to celebrate the \r\nrich diversity of sport.\r\nAustralia remains committed to working towards \r\nfurther inclusivity, equality and diversity in sport and \r\nusing sport as an enabler for development and peace. \r\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nthe Permanent Missions of Tunisia and Monaco for \r\ntheir co-facilitation of the draft resolution to be adopted \r\ntoday. Australia is very pleased to co-sponsor the draft \r\nresolution, as we did with its many precursors.\r\nMr. Rybakov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): We \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his very \r\nthorough report on strengthening the global framework \r\nfor leveraging sport for development and peace \r\n(A/73/325).\r\nBelarus was very pleased to join as a co-sponsor of \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.36, entitled “Sport as an enabler \r\nof sustainable development”. We express our gratitude \r\nto Monaco and Tunisia for promoting this important \r\nissue on the United Nations agenda.\r\nThe role of physical fitness and sport in forming \r\na healthy way of life and in achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals is growing every year. Sport \r\nplays an important role in contributing to sustainable \r\ndevelopment, reaffirming the principles of tolerance \r\nand respect, broadening rights and opportunities for \r\nwomen and young people, individuals and communities, \r\nand helping to achieve goals in the areas of health care, \r\neducation and social integration.\r\nAgainst the current backdrop of international \r\ninstability, sport continues to serve as a resource that \r\ncan consolidate the ideals of peace, friendship and \r\nmutual understanding. We therefore highly value \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations and its specialized \r\nagencies in seeking to use sporting opportunities to \r\npromote development and peace.\r\nPromoting health, physical fitness and sport are \r\namong the priority areas of the social policy of Belarus. \r\nOur country is committed to developing international \r\ncooperation in sport and to strengthening friendly \r\nrelations among peoples through sport based on \r\nhumanist principles and the Olympic ideal.\r\nSport is indivisible from politics; it is the people’s \r\ndiplomacy. Through athleticism, States can project \r\ntheir national image on the international stage, while \r\nillustrating the social and political values of their \r\nsocieties. However, sport is politically neutral, and it \r\nmust remain so.\r\nUnfortunately, sport is increasingly not about the \r\nplaying and has developed into a business rife with \r\ncorruption and unsportsmanlike activities to win at all \r\ncosts. Doping has become the scourge of modern sport. \r\nBelarus actively participates in international efforts to \r\ncombat drug use in sport, and upholds the principle of \r\nlegal, individualized and just punishment. At the same \r\ntime, we strongly condemn the tendency to politically \r\npressure certain athletes and entire sporting federations \r\nunder the pretext of fighting against doping, while in \r\nfact it is used to settle political scores, and athletes are \r\nbeing caught up in those dirty games.\r\nBiased officiating is another vice in modern sport, \r\nand it violates the principles of fair play and makes \r\nA/73/PV.44 03/12/2018\r\n4/12 18-40542\r\nathletes lose faith in the same chances of winning. In \r\nthat context, to combat the negative trends in sport, \r\nan important role must be played by the International \r\nOlympic Committee, which must be supported in its \r\nactivities by national Olympic committees. We must \r\nnot ignore their opinions.\r\nInternational sporting events must be organized \r\nin the spirit of peace, mutual understanding and \r\nfriendship, and we must recognize and respect the \r\nunifying and reconciliatory nature of such events. \r\nBelarus is very proud that it was granted the right to \r\nhost the most important European sporting event of \r\n2019 — the second European Games. The fact that \r\nthese Games will be held in Minsk will be an important \r\nmilestone on the European sporting calendar. We note \r\nthat preparations are already under way for the eighty-\r\nfifth Ice Hockey World Championship, to be held in the \r\ncapitals of Belarus and Latvia  — Minsk and Riga — in \r\n2021.\r\nWhile sport is not a panacea for solving all \r\ninternational problems, it has a unique capacity to \r\nbring together people from various cultures and to \r\nhelp strengthen mutual understanding among States \r\nand peoples in the spirit of the true Olympic ideals of \r\nfriendship, solidarity and fair play.\r\nMr. Nasir (Maldives): The Maldives is proud to \r\nhave co-sponsored draft resolution A/73/L.36, entitled \r\n“Sports as an enabler of sustainable development”. \r\nAs the draft resolution reiterates, sport has the \r\nextraordinary ability to unite peoples, overcome \r\ndifferences and promote equality, as well as to help \r\nmaintain the physical health of a society. Those \r\nare some of key values that inform our approach to \r\nsustainable development in general, and to Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals 3, 4, 5, 16 and 17 in particular.\r\nSport, especially the Olympic ideal, has helped to \r\ncreate equality and a level playing field to bring out \r\nthe best in humankind. The Maldives is proud to be an \r\nactive participant in the Olympic movement. Maldivian \r\nathletes took the great leap forward by participating in \r\nthe Olympic Games for the first time in 1988. It was \r\ntruly a unique moment in time, not only for those who \r\nparticipated but also for a generation of youth inspired by \r\nthe Games as a transformative event. The Government \r\nof the Maldives has prioritized sport as an instrument \r\nof youth development to promote a healthy population \r\nand to realize the full potential of the country’s youth.\r\nThe Maldives enacted its first Sports Act in \r\nSeptember 2015. The legislation aims to assist the \r\npromotion of competitive sports and cultural activities \r\nat the international, national and island levels. It also \r\noutlines policies and guidelines to facilitate sports \r\ndevelopment with community-level participation.\r\nThat is why we pioneered the implementation of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2250 (2015). The Maldives, \r\nin collaboration with the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, held an official ceremony in the Maldives \r\nin August 2016 to launch the implementation of the \r\nresolution, thereby becoming the first country to do so \r\nin the Asia-Pacific region.\r\nSince assuming office on 17 November, the new \r\nGovernment of President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih \r\nhas continued to make significant investments in \r\nsports infrastructure and inclusive opportunities for \r\nall. As part of President Solih’s 100-day agenda, the \r\nGovernment has made it a priority to designate a \r\nsports counsellor on every island to eliminate the \r\nwage difference between men’s and women’s national \r\nsports teams and to encourage female participation in \r\nsport to challenge traditional gender stereotypes. The \r\ninvestments in sports will no doubt allow young people \r\nto develop leadership skills and provide them with \r\nsupport networks outside their homes. It is therefore \r\nimperative to empower the growing youth population \r\nto become active citizens in their communities, which \r\nwill foster economic and social progress.\r\nSports programmes coordinated by the United \r\nNations, Government agencies and non-governmental \r\norganizations have been found to facilitate sustainable \r\ndevelopment and peaceful coexistence. It is encouraging \r\nto see that sport for peace and development is reflected \r\nin all 17 Goals under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and to see that in action in countries \r\naround the world.\r\nThe Maldives has been making steady progress \r\nin regional and international competitions in various \r\nsports. Our women’s and men’s teams have performed \r\nquite well in recent months. That success has helped \r\nto galvanize young people in the country and created \r\nmore opportunities that will unleash their creativity to \r\nallow them to aim higher and dream bigger.\r\nMr. Al Braiki (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I would like to say that I am \r\npleased to participate on behalf of the young people \r\nof the United Arab Emirates in this general debate on \r\n03/12/2018 A/73/PV.44\r\n18-40542 5/12\r\nagenda item 12, entitled “Sports for development and \r\npeace”. We welcome the efforts of Monaco and Tunisia \r\nas co-facilitators of draft resolution A/73/L.36, entitled \r\n“Sport as an enabler of sustainable development”, \r\nwhich stresses the importance of strengthening the \r\nglobal framework for leveraging sport for development \r\nand peace. Sport is an important enabler for achieving \r\nsustainable development under the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, contributing to the \r\nattainment of the desired goals in the areas of health, \r\neducation, justice and peace.\r\nIn March 2019, my country will host 7,000 athletes \r\nfrom more than 170 States at the Abu Dhabi Special \r\nOlympics World Games — the first time they will be \r\nheld in the Middle East since the Special Olympics \r\nwas established 50 years ago. That is the largest \r\nhuman sporting event in the world focused on enabling \r\nthose with mental disabilities to participate in sports. \r\nThe event represents an important step towards the \r\nintegration of persons with mental disabilities into \r\ninclusive societies.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates attaches great importance \r\nto building a society that is highly cognizant of, and \r\neducated in, the sport of ju-jitsu. We have adopted the \r\nsport as a main subject in more than 162 schools and \r\nmore than 300 training centres, with curricula devised \r\nto support students in developing technical skills and \r\nphysical health, as well as to strengthen the values of \r\ndiscipline and commitment and encourage students to \r\nbecome passionate about sports. My country established \r\nthe Abu Dhabi World Ju-Jitsu Championship, now in its \r\ntenth year, to which we welcome the top professional \r\nmen and women as well as young people and people \r\nwith disabilities.\r\nWe believe that the role of women and girls is an \r\nessential tool in the advancement of women. In the \r\nUnited Arab Emirat, women and girls have attained \r\nprominent positions in karate, weightlifting, volleyball \r\nand Ju-Jitsu. Moreover, the development of the Sheikha \r\nFatima bint Mubarak Prize in women’s sport is the first \r\nof its kind, aimed at enhancing the position of women \r\nin sport while promoting development and seeking to \r\nachieve their aspirations.\r\nSport is a useful tool for enhancing the participation \r\nof young people in their growth, self-confidence and \r\nsense of belonging, while strengthening tolerance and \r\nrespect. Consequently, youngsters become agents for \r\nchange and partners in building peaceful and inclusive \r\nsocieties and contributing to sustainable development \r\nand social cohesion. That is why young people in my \r\ncountry have participated in a number of workshops \r\non sport diplomacy and sport as a lifestyle, as well as \r\na workshop on sport, youth and social development, \r\nwhich was held last week at the Permanent Mission of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates to the United Nations. We \r\nattach great importance to listening to the opinions of \r\nyoung people and to discussing their ideas and opinions \r\nas a means of finding solutions to challenges, with the \r\nparticipation of decision-makers and State officials as \r\nwell as at the international level.\r\nMy country is also harnessing sport for peace \r\nand development by encouraging sports in refugee \r\ncamps. We recently launched the 2018 summer sports \r\nprogramme in the Mrajeeb Al Fhood camp in Jordan \r\nto develop the talents of young people in the camp and \r\nhelp to improve the living conditions of refugees.\r\nIn conclusion, as a representative of the young \r\npeople of the United Arab Emirates, I would like \r\nto stress the importance of leveraging sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace as a key element and enabler of \r\npeaceful coexistence, tolerance and team spirit. Sport \r\nalso imparts the values of discipline, endurance and \r\ncourage to young people.\r\nMr. Chua (Singapore): At the outset, my delegation \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report on strengthening the global \r\nframework for leveraging sport for development \r\nand peace (A/73/325). We would also like to express \r\nour appreciation to the Permanent Missions of \r\nMonaco and Tunisia for their hard work on draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.36, entitled “Sport as an enabler of \r\nsustainable development”.\r\nSport can be a force for positive change in society. \r\nIt instils values such as discipline, perseverance, \r\nteamwork and sportsmanship. It also inspires people \r\nto push boundaries and strive for greater heights \r\nbeyond what they believe they can normally achieve. \r\nThose are important skills for an individual’s personal \r\nand professional life and future. In addition, exercise \r\nand sport contribute to improvements in health and \r\nthe overall quality of life of individuals towards the \r\nattainment of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nSingapore celebrates sport in everyday life. We \r\nlaunched the Get Active initiative in 2016, a week-\r\nlong sports festival that encourages Singaporeans \r\nto participate in sport and to have an active and \r\nA/73/PV.44 03/12/2018\r\n6/12 18-40542\r\nhealthy lifestyle. Sport not only brings about health \r\nbenefits; it also has a positive impact on society. As \r\nnoted in the Secretary-General’s report, sport can help \r\nto build human and social capital and promote social \r\nintegration, inclusion and cohesion. It is a powerful \r\nvehicle that brings individuals and communities \r\ntogether. It can foster social development by changing \r\nperceptions. Regardless of faith, culture, background \r\nor gender, sport enhances mutual understanding, true \r\nteamwork and respect.\r\nThe esprit de corps forged through sport also \r\nfosters a sense of pride and solidarity among people. \r\nGiven the personal and development benefits sport \r\noffers, emphasis should be placed on increasing access \r\nto, and participation in, sport. It is for those reasons \r\nthat Singapore has integrated sport into our national \r\neducational curriculum under the sports education \r\nprogramme. Those are important values that we believe \r\nshould be imbued in our people, especially our youth.\r\nSport also contributes to lowering barriers in \r\nsocieties in other ways. It can engender greater \r\nacceptance and awareness of persons with disabilities. \r\nIn 2016, Singapore launched the Disability Sports \r\nMaster Plan to ensure that sport in Singapore remains \r\nan inclusive activity. The Master Plan provides persons \r\nwith disabilities with more opportunities to participate \r\nin sports. It also develops and expands the pool of \r\neducators with expertise in disability sport. We are \r\nalso working to increase awareness and support for our \r\nathletes with disabilities among Singaporeans through \r\nthe annual inclusive sports festival, which features \r\nadaptive sports try-outs and workshops that everyone \r\ncan experience.\r\nThe efforts to develop sport in Singapore have \r\nsucceeded. Notably, at the October 2018 Asian Para \r\nGames in Jakarta, Singapore fielded 44 para-athletes \r\nacross 10 sports and achieved our best-ever medal haul. \r\nBut sport is about more than just results. For our para-\r\nathletes, it gives them self-belief and confidence that, \r\ndespite physical disabilities, they are able to participate \r\nand compete. They were also an inspiration to all \r\nSingaporeans, who saw how they achieved sporting \r\nexcellence despite their physical disabilities. They prove \r\nthat, with hard work, perseverance and determination, \r\none can overcome all odds.\r\nThe benefits of sport also transcend national \r\nboundaries. Sport helps to promote closer people-to-\r\npeople ties between Member States. There are \r\ncountless inspirational stories of how regional and \r\ninternational friendships were forged in the fiery battle \r\nof sporting competition. We hope that such ties serve \r\nas stepping stones towards peace and greater dialogue \r\nand cooperation.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nrecognizes the role of sport in the realization of \r\ndevelopment and peace, the promotion of tolerance and \r\nrespect and the empowerment of women and young \r\npeople, as well as its many contributions to health, \r\neducation and our goals of social inclusion. Let us \r\ncontinue to uphold the spirit of sport and aim to build \r\na sustainable, inclusive and prosperous future for \r\nall peoples.\r\nMs. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report (A/73/325), and in particular the Division for \r\nInclusive Social Development, the Secretariat entity \r\nnow charged with the issue of sport for development \r\nand peace.\r\nThe new title of this draft resolution, “Sport as \r\nan enabler of sustainable development” (A/73/L.36), \r\nunequivocally affirms that sport provides numerous \r\nopportunities for achieving the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. It was 25 years ago, at the \r\ninitiative of Egypt, that the General Assembly first \r\nadopted a resolution dedicated to sport and the Olympic \r\nideal (resolution 48/11). Over the years since 1993, the \r\nrecognition of sport within the work of the United \r\nNations has grown continuously.\r\nAs my counterpart the Permanent Representative \r\nof Tunisia underscored in his statement introducing \r\nthe draft resolution, the text before us highlights the \r\nnormative framework relating to sport. The vast \r\ncontribution of sport to development and peace is \r\nundeniable, and we are convinced that it has immense \r\npotential in the context of our joint efforts to achieve \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals. We must continue \r\nto develop sport’s enabling role, in particular by using \r\nthe communication tools used by young people.\r\nWhat better example than the Pyeongchang \r\nOlympic Winter Games to illustrate what dialogue \r\naround sport can achieve? The success of the efforts of \r\nthe President of the International Olympic Committee \r\nto establish dialogue between the two Koreas has sent \r\nthe world a message of hope. To see athletes from those \r\ntwo countries parade under the same flag during the \r\n03/12/2018 A/73/PV.44\r\n18-40542 7/12\r\nopening and closing ceremonies was extremely moving \r\nfor all those who love sport and advocate peace.\r\nBeyond those symbolic moments, sport promotes \r\nunderstanding, cohesion, reconciliation and peace. In \r\nmany countries, among many communities, sport has \r\nproved to be a common language that overcomes barriers.\r\nWhether recreational or competitive, solo or group, \r\nsport conveys fundamental values and allows human \r\nbeings to express their full potential. In the context of \r\nthe Olympism in Action forum held on the eve of the \r\nopening of the Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires \r\nin October, in which I had the privilege of participating, \r\nI had occasion to realize just how much of the work we \r\ndo at the United Nations is relevant to non-governmental \r\norganizations (NGOs) and grass-roots associations, \r\nespecially in the areas of social development and \r\nhuman rights. That is worth underscoring in a year \r\nwhen we are celebrating the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and on the \r\nheels of the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit we held in \r\nSeptember. It is therefore crucial that we always keep \r\nin mind throughout our deliberations those who will be \r\nimpacted by the decisions we make.\r\nThe great success of that first forum, which brought \r\ntogether the members of the Olympic movement, NGOs, \r\nsports professionals and United Nations agencies, \r\ndemonstrated, as if there were any need, the unifying \r\npower of the International Olympic Committee and its \r\neffective contribution to the activities of the United \r\nNations. The discussions also confirmed the role of \r\nsport as a means of raising awareness about social \r\nissues and its contribution to social cohesion, inclusion \r\nand the fight against inequalities, including gender and \r\npay inequality.\r\nAthletes are role models, and young people in \r\nparticular identify with the greatest champions. \r\nTherefore, just like world-renowned teams, athletes are \r\nable to spread positive messages and help to support \r\ninternational cooperation activities. It is therefore up to \r\nus to convince them to help us promote the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe societal benefits of sport are indisputable. \r\nThe draft resolution recognizes the Kazan Action \r\nPlan, endorsed by UNESCO in 2017, and its sport \r\npolicy follow-up framework. I would like to stress the \r\nrelevance of that tool as a point of reference, since it \r\nsets out a comprehensive vision of universal access \r\nto sport, physical education and physical activity and \r\narticulates how they can contribute to the achievement \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals and their targets.\r\nSport is a fundamental educational tool, and we \r\nmust continue to work to ensure that it is an integral \r\npart of school curricula in all countries. Access to \r\nsport is particularly important for girls and people with \r\ndisabilities: they must be assured unhindered access \r\nto sport. In that connection, I would like to commend \r\nthe work of the United Nations and its partners as we \r\ncelebrate today, 3 December, as the International Day \r\nof Persons with Disabilities.\r\nThrough sport many young people from disadvantaged \r\nbackgrounds have been able to pursue higher education \r\nand to access opportunities otherwise unavailable to \r\nthem. I must also commend private sector-sponsored \r\nafter-school programmes, which enable young people \r\nfrom marginalized communities to avoid becoming \r\ncaught up in delinquency.\r\nAs highlighted in the political declaration of the \r\nthird high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases, \r\nheld in September, regular physical activity should \r\ncontinue to be encouraged as a means of promoting \r\na healthy lifestyle, as it helps to fight cardiovascular \r\ndisease and obesity. Given its benefits, today physical \r\nactivity is integrated into medical treatment, including \r\nin the fight against cancer, since it helps patients to \r\nbetter withstand intense treatment.\r\nWe see an encouraging convergence of efforts \r\nby different sectors of society, State institutions, the \r\nprivate sector and medical establishments. Partnerships \r\nwill be key for better harnessing sport to promote and \r\nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nOur delegation is also particularly pleased with the \r\nevents that it was able to promote over the past year in \r\ncooperation with many missions and organizations on \r\nthe sidelines of the Commission for Social Development \r\nand the Commission on the Status of Women, as well \r\nas on the occasion of the International Day of Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace and the High-level Political \r\nForum on Sustainable Development and in conjunction \r\nwith the Football World Cup.\r\nThe fruitful collaboration between the Permanent \r\nMissions of Tunisia and Monaco, co-Chairs of the \r\nGroup of Friends of Sport for Development and Peace, \r\nhas increased over the past year with the opening \r\nup of the Group to all interested Member States. We \r\nA/73/PV.44 03/12/2018\r\n8/12 18-40542\r\nhave focused on providing a space for interaction and \r\nexchange with United Nations entities. The strong \r\nmobilization at our monthly meetings demonstrates the \r\npower of sport as a factor of sustainable development. \r\nWe are particularly proud that the draft resolution we \r\nare about to adopt is geared towards the future we want \r\nand highlights the synergies between sport and the \r\n2030 Agenda.\r\nI could not conclude without expressing my \r\ngratitude and friendship to my Tunisian counterpart, \r\nan accomplished sportsman with whom it has been my \r\nhonour and pleasure to co-chair the Group of Friends of \r\nSport over the past six years.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.36, entitled “Sport as an enabler of \r\nsustainable development”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative or \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMs. De Miranda (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I should \r\nlike to announce that since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution, in addition to those delegations listed in \r\ndocument A/73/L.36, the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors of the draft resolution: Albania, \r\nAlgeria, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Bahrain, Belarus, \r\nBelgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Bulgaria, \r\nBurundi, Canada, the Central African Republic, Chile, \r\nChina, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cyprus, the \r\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Dominica, the Dominican \r\nRepublic, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Honduras, \r\nHungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, Kuwait, Latvia, \r\nLebanon, Lesotho, Libya, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, \r\nMalawi, the Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Mongolia, \r\nMontenegro, Morocco, Nepal, Nigeria, Oman, Palau, \r\nPanama, the Philippines, Poland, Qatar, the Republic \r\nof Korea, the Republic of Moldova, Serbia, Slovakia, \r\nSlovenia, the Sudan, Sweden, Togo, Turkmenistan, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Viet Nam.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/73/L.36?\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.36 was adopted \r\n(resolution 73/24).\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor \r\nto speakers in explanation of position following the \r\nadoption of the resolution, I would like to remind \r\ndelegations that explanations are limited to 10 minutes \r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Schorr (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States believes that sport and physical \r\neducation contribute to the promotion of education, \r\nhealth, development and peace. As such, we joined the \r\nconsensus on resolution 73/24 today with the express \r\nunderstanding that the resolution does not imply that \r\nStates must join instruments that they have not already \r\njoined, or implement provisions of human rights \r\ninstruments that they have not accepted. By joining \r\nthe consensus on the resolution, we do not recognize \r\nany change in the current state of treaty or customary \r\ninternational law. We also understand the resolution’s \r\nreaffirmation of prior documents to apply to those that \r\naffirmed them initially and, in the case of international \r\ntreaties, to the States parties.\r\nWe further understand the reference in the resolution \r\nto “internationally agreed development goals” to refer \r\nto the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The \r\nUnited States position is articulate in the following \r\nexplanation of position on that document.\r\nWe take this opportunity to make important points \r\nof clarification on language related to the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. We underscore that the \r\n2030 Agenda is non-binding and does not create or \r\naffect rights or obligations under international law, \r\nneither does it create any new financial commitments.\r\nThe United States recognizes the 2030 Agenda \r\nas a global framework for sustainable development \r\nthat can help countries work towards global peace and \r\nprosperity. We applaud the call for shared responsibility, \r\nincluding national responsibility, in the 2030 Agenda, \r\nand emphasize that all countries have a role to play in \r\nachieving its vision. The 2030 Agenda recognizes that \r\neach country must work towards implementation in \r\naccordance with its own national policies and priorities.\r\nThe United States also underscores that paragraph \r\n18 of the 2030 Agenda calls for countries to implement \r\nthe Agenda in a manner that is consistent with the rights \r\nand obligations of States under international law.\r\nWe also highlight our mutual recognition, in \r\nparagraph 58, that the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda must respect and be without prejudice to \r\nthe independent mandates of other processes and \r\ninstitutions, including negotiations, and does not \r\n03/12/2018 A/73/PV.44\r\n18-40542 9/12\r\nprejudge or serve as a precedent for decisions and \r\nactions under way in other forums. For example, the \r\nAgenda does not represent a commitment to provide \r\nnew market access for goods or services. The Agenda \r\nalso does not interpret or alter any World Trade \r\nOrganization agreement or decision, including the \r\nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual \r\nProperty Rights.\r\nWith regard to paragraph 9, we support the focus on \r\ntraining, capacity-building and education of teachers, \r\ncoaches and community leaders, although the United \r\nStates does so mindful of, and consistent with, our \r\nlimited authority at the federal level with respect to \r\neducation, which is primarily the responsibility of our \r\nstate and local governments. With regard to paragraph \r\n15, the United States believes that the United Nations \r\nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, \r\nwhich set out the responsibilities of business enterprises \r\nand provide relevant guidance for sports-related \r\norganizations, federations and associations, provide \r\na valuable, important and universal framework for \r\nhosting mega sports events, including the complicated \r\nprocess of bidding, organizing, executing and ensuring \r\npositive legacies for such events.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of position.\r\nThe General Assembly has concluded its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 12.\r\nAgenda item 14 (continued)\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation \r\nof and follow-up to the outcomes of the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields\r\nDraft resolution (A/73/L.39)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Nigeria to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.39.\r\nMr. Muhammad Bande (Nigeria): We express our \r\ncondolences at the demise of President George Herbert \r\nWalker Bush. May he rest in peace.\r\nI have the honour to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.39, entitled “International Day of Education”. \r\nNigeria is introducing this draft resolution, which calls \r\nfor the observance of 24 January of every year as the \r\nInternational Day of Education under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations, in order to fill in an observed lacuna \r\nin the collective global efforts to promote education as \r\na critical aspect of development.\r\nEducation has been seen as fundamental to global \r\ndevelopment, especially within the context of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. Many United \r\nNations documents have also underscored the centrality \r\nof education to development.\r\nThe United Nations observes many days devoted \r\nto many important things, from bees and mountains \r\nto cycling and others. Clearly, it is education and \r\nknowledge that have led to the observance of such days. \r\nIt is therefore important, even belatedly, to accord such \r\na day to education itself. An intentional day of education \r\nmarked by the international community would situation \r\neducation at the core of the agenda for achieving the \r\n2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThe United Nations has defined education as not \r\nonly a right but also a path towards human development. \r\nIts catalytic impact is concretely felt in the way that it \r\nopens doors for individuals, communities and nations, \r\nexpands human freedom, contributes to fostering \r\ndemocracy and economic growth, improves health and \r\nreduces poverty. Furthermore, education has contributed \r\nto global peace, development, innovation, technology \r\nand agriculture. It has also helped in tackling climate \r\nchange and in improving the enjoyment of human \r\nrights. In what matter of importance is education not \r\nimplicated? That being the case, the denial of education \r\nto any human being is a serious and permanent injury \r\nto that person. So is it with nations and societies.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, Nigeria calls on the \r\nglobal community to endorse the observance of the \r\nInternational Day of Education. Such endorsement is \r\nexpected to increase awareness, enhance momentum, \r\nsupport innovative efforts in transforming education, \r\ncelebrate invention and innovation brought about by \r\nknowledge derived from education, and increase the \r\nvisibility of education as critical to human and societal \r\ndevelopment. It would also invite the global audience \r\nto the continuous task of enhancing education and \r\nbroadening educational opportunities, especially for \r\nthose on the verge of being left behind, such as women \r\nand children and others in vulnerable situations, \r\nincluding people with disabilities and those in \r\nhumanitarian emergency situations.\r\nThe main objective of the draft resolution is not only \r\nto celebrate education in the form of a carnival but also \r\nA/73/PV.44 03/12/2018\r\n10/12 18-40542\r\nto draw particular attention to the millions, especially \r\ngirls and women, in many countries who are denied this \r\nsupreme good. That should further galvanize support \r\namong all of us to commit to providing education for all.\r\nFinally, I would like to express my delegation’s \r\nprofound appreciation to all the delegations that \r\nparticipated actively in the negotiation of the draft \r\nresolution. Indeed, the various United Nations agencies \r\nwhose technical skills on the subject, such as UNESCO, \r\nand an array of non-governmental organizations \r\nhelped to shape the draft resolution. Their valuable \r\ncontributions, cooperation and support helped us to \r\narrive at an agreed text that reflects the consensus among \r\nmembers of the General Assembly. My appreciation \r\nalso goes to those delegations — Algeria, Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, Chad, the Congo, Canada, Equatorial Guinea, \r\nFinland, France, Guinea, Ireland, Kenya, Luxembourg, \r\nMalta, Qatar, Singapore, Suriname, Tunisia, Uganda \r\nand Zimbabwe — that have already co-sponsored the \r\ndraft resolution. In the same vein, I would like to invite \r\nthose that have yet to co-sponsor it to do so, given the \r\nimportance of this landmark draft resolution.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/73/L.39, entitled \r\n“International Day of Education”.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMs. De Miranda (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I should like \r\nto announce that, since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution, and in addition to those delegations listed \r\nin the document, the following countries have become \r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/73/L.39: Afghanistan, \r\nAndorra, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Canada, \r\nthe Central African Republic, China, Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nDenmark, Egypt, Estonia, Ethiopia, Greece, India, \r\nIndonesia, Israel, Lithuania, Malawi, the Maldives, \r\nMalta, Monaco, Mongolia, Morocco, Norway, \r\nPanama, the Republic of Korea, Romania, the Russian \r\nFederation, San Marino, South Sudan, the Sudan, Togo, \r\nTurkey, Ukraine and Viet Nam.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/73/L.39?\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.39 was adopted \r\n(resolution 73/25).\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor to \r\ndelegations that wish to speak in explanation of position \r\nfollowing the adoption of the resolution, I would like \r\nto remind delegations that explanations are limited to \r\n10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMs. Schorr (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States believes that education serves as a \r\nfoundation for wide-reaching and long-lasting impact, \r\nparticularly for the most vulnerable, and helps to put \r\nall our societies on a more sustainable path across all \r\nsectors of development. We are pleased to announce \r\nthat the United States Government has just released its \r\nfirst strategy on international basic education, which \r\nemphasizes our commitment to serving young people \r\nin conflict and crisis, investing in both Government-\r\nprovided and non-State schools, and focusing on \r\nmeasurable learning outcomes for students.\r\nWe wish to call attention yet again to the important \r\npoints of clarification on language related to the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development that we made a \r\nfew minutes ago under agenda item 12 following the \r\nadoption of resolution 73/24, entitled “Sport as an \r\nenabler of sustainable development”.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of position.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 14.\r\nAgenda item 131\r\nInvestigation into the conditions and circumstances \r\nresulting in the tragic death of Dag Hammarskjöld \r\nand of the members of the party accompanying him\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with rule 70 \r\nof the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, I now \r\ngive the f loor to Mr. Miguel Ferreira de Serpa Soares, \r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and United \r\nNations Legal Counsel, to provide an oral briefing \r\non behalf of the Secretary-General, as mandated in \r\nparagraph 7 of resolution 72/252, of 24 December 2017.\r\nMr. Ferreira de Serpa Soares (Office of Legal \r\nAffairs): The Secretary-General regrets that he cannot \r\njoin the General Assembly today, as he is in Katowice \r\nattending the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It \r\nis therefore my pleasure to deliver this oral briefing on \r\nhis behalf.\r\n03/12/2018 A/73/PV.44\r\n18-40542 11/12\r\nIn its resolution 72/252, the Assembly requested that \r\nthe Secretary-General provide the Assembly, before the \r\nend of the main part of its seventy-third session, with \r\nan oral briefing on any progress made in relation to the \r\ninvestigation into the conditions and circumstances \r\nresulting in the tragic death of former Secretary-\r\nGeneral Dag Hammarskjöld and the members of the \r\nparty accompanying him.\r\nAs an initial matter, I wish to recall that, pursuant \r\nto resolution 72/252, in March, the Secretary-General \r\nreappointed Mr. Mohamed Chande Othman as Eminent \r\nPerson to continue the Dag Hammarskjöld investigation. \r\nIn advance of the oral briefing, the Eminent Person \r\nsubmitted to the Secretary-General an interim report \r\non progress in relation to the investigation.\r\nUpon the Eminent Person’s reappointment \r\nand pursuant to resolution 72/252, Mr. Othman \r\ninitially requested nine Member States to appoint an \r\nindependent and high-ranking official to conduct a \r\ndedicated internal review of their intelligence, security \r\nand defence archives to identify information that might \r\nbe of relevance to the Dag Hammarskjöld investigation. \r\nThe initial nine Member States to which requests \r\nwere made were Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, \r\nthe Russian Federation, South Africa, Sweden, the \r\nUnited Kingdom and the United States. Out of the nine \r\nMember States to which requests were made, Belgium, \r\nCanada, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, \r\nSweden and the United States took action in response \r\nto resolution 72/252 and the Eminent Person’s requests. \r\nSince the establishment of improved cooperation \r\nbetween those Member States and the Eminent Person, \r\nnew information has been received from certain \r\nindependent and high-ranking officials appointed by \r\nMember States, as well as from other sources. That \r\ninformation will be assessed by the Eminent Person for \r\nits probative value, in accordance with his mandate.\r\nA preliminary review indicates that the new \r\ninformation, including that from intelligence, security \r\nand defence archives, is of probative value in respect of \r\nour knowledge of the context and surrounding events \r\nof 1961, the presence of foreign paramilitary and \r\nintelligence personnel in and around the Congo and \r\nthe capacity of armed forces present in and around the \r\nregion at that time.\r\nIn recent months, the Eminent Person has made \r\nadditional requests for the appointment of independent \r\nand high-ranking officials to another five Member \r\nStates, namely, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, Portugal, Zambia and Zimbabwe. He has already \r\nreceived notification from the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo and Zimbabwe of their appointments and \r\ncontinues to follow up on those additional requests.\r\nThe Secretary-General wishes to express his \r\ngratitude to Member States for their cooperation with \r\nthe Eminent Person and their willingness to provide \r\nadditional information. The Secretary-General also \r\nwishes to remind Member States that may hold \r\ninformation of the need to appoint independent and \r\nhigh-ranking officials, or to make possible a full \r\nreview of their intelligence, security and defence \r\narchives, consistent with paragraph 5 of resolution \r\n72/252. In particular, the Secretary-General notes that \r\nthe Eminent Person calls on certain Member States to \r\nappoint such officials, and he is considering how he can \r\nassist in that process.\r\nThe Eminent Person appointed pursuant to \r\nresolution 71/260 noted in his report of last year that \r\n“the burden of proof has now shifted to Member States” \r\n(A/71/1042, para. 21) to show that they have conducted a \r\nfull review of all records and archives in their custody or \r\npossession, including those from intelligence, security \r\nand defence archives. Indeed, the active participation \r\nof Member States remains of the highest importance in \r\nour shared search for the truth on this matter.\r\nThe Secretary-General reiterates his full personal \r\ncommitment to this matter and restates his gratitude \r\nfor the work done so far by Member States and the \r\nEminent Person. The Secretary-General recalls that it \r\nis our solemn duty to pursue the full truth concerning \r\nthe conditions and circumstances resulting in the tragic \r\ndeath of former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld \r\nand the members of the party accompanying him.\r\nThe Secretary-General looks forward to further \r\ncooperation and engagement among Member States, \r\nthe Eminent Person and the Secretariat, with a view \r\nto fully meeting the objectives set out by the General \r\nAssembly in resolution 72/252. The interim report \r\nof the Eminent Person will be available to interested \r\nMember States following this briefing and, consistent \r\nwith resolution 72/252, the Eminent Person will submit \r\na final report to the Secretary-General in mid-2019.\r\nMs. Schoulgin Nyoni (Sweden): Let me first \r\nexpress my gratitude to the Secretary-General and the \r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and Legal \r\nCounsel for their strong commitment to, and continued \r\nA/73/PV.44 03/12/2018\r\n12/12 18-40542\r\nengagement on, this matter. The Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s presence here today signals to all of us the \r\ndetermination of the United Nations leadership to \r\nsee this issue through to a conclusion. Let me also \r\nexpress my sincere gratitude to the Eminent Person, \r\nJudge Mohamed Chande Othman, and his team for \r\ntheir tireless work on this matter, and to all Member \r\nStates that have collaborated on, and contributed to, the \r\ninvestigation. Since 2015, Judge Othman has overseen \r\nmajor progress in the investigation. We strongly believe \r\nthat we now have a unique opportunity to shed light on \r\nwhat happened in Ndola on 17 September 1961.\r\nWe are pleased to learn today about the progress \r\nmade in the investigation since the reappointment of \r\nJudge Othman, earlier this year. We look forward to \r\nreceiving his interim report in order to study the details \r\nfurther. Let me particularly thank those Member States \r\nthat have appointed national investigators to conduct \r\ndedicated reviews of their national archives to determine \r\nwhether additional relevant information exists.\r\nEarlier this year, Sweden appointed Ambassador \r\nMathias Mossberg as special investigator to ensure \r\nthat all relevant information in the Swedish archives \r\nhas reached the United Nations investigation. We have \r\nlearned from the briefing today how important the \r\nfindings of the national investigators are to driving the \r\ninvestigation forward. Therefore, let me strongly urge \r\nthose countries that have been asked to but have yet to \r\nappoint a national investigator to do so without further \r\ndelay. That was called for in resolution 72/252, which \r\nwas adopted by consensus 11 months ago in this very \r\nHall. The value of independent confirmation that all \r\nrelevant information has been shared with the United \r\nNations investigation cannot be underestimated.\r\nJudge Othman has concluded that the burden of \r\nproof has shifted to Member States to show that we \r\nhave all conducted full reviews of records and archives, \r\nincluding those that remain classified. We must all \r\nshow, beyond any uncertainty, that we have done just \r\nthat. We owe it to the families of those who perished 57 \r\nyears ago and to the Organization itself. We count on the \r\nfull cooperation of all Member States. It is our shared \r\nresponsibility to pursue the full truth in this matter.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this agenda item.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 131.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.20 a.m.\r\n"
