"United Nations A/73/PV.46\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n46th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 6 December 2018, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Gertze \r\n(Namibia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 40\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/73/374))\r\nDraft resolution (A/73/L.44)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Germany to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.44.\r\nMr. Heusgen (Germany): It is my pleasure to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/73/L.44, entitled “The \r\nsituation in Afghanistan”. As members of the Assembly \r\nknow, this text was first introduced in 1980 and has \r\nbeen reintroduced every year since then. Since 2002, \r\nGermany has served as the facilitator of the draft \r\nresolution. It has never been easy but, in the end, \r\nwe have always been able to reach consensus, which \r\nwe believe is extremely important because it shows \r\nthe international community’s consensus view of \r\nAfghanistan and its population, which is suffering \r\nunder the conflict taking place there. That suffering is \r\nthe reason that it is very important for the international \r\ncommunity to be united.\r\nThe substance of draft resolution A/73/L.44 \r\nreflects the dynamics in Afghanistan over the years, \r\nthe changes on the ground and international support. \r\nThe most important events to take place this year were \r\nthe parliamentary elections in October and the Geneva \r\nMinisterial Conference in November, which was \r\nsuccessful. The text of the draft resolution reflects the \r\npositions of Member States as they were communicated \r\nto us, and we did everything possible to accommodate \r\nall of them. Of course, attaining 100 per cent is never \r\npossible; compromise is necessary, and we strove to \r\nachieve it. Of course, in the end, the text must reflect \r\nthe facts on the ground.\r\nThe draft resolution’s main purpose is to express \r\nsupport for Afghanistan and its people. I would \r\ntherefore like to thank all delegations that have showed \r\nflexibility in upholding the draft’s show of support for \r\nthe people of Afghanistan.\r\nTurning to the substance of the draft resolution, our \r\nmost important concern remains the fragile security \r\nsituation. We are all aware of the number of high-\r\nprofile attacks, the most recent being the attack on \r\n20 November that targeted religious scholars and left \r\n55 people dead. We call on all people in Afghanistan to \r\nstand together.\r\nWe also wish pay tribute to the members of Afghan \r\nNational Defence and Security Forces for their patriotism \r\nand sacrifices. Together with its international partners, \r\nGermany will continue to be present in Afghanistan \r\nsecurity-wise, through the NATO-led Resolute Support \r\nMission in support of the Afghan security forces. Our \r\naim is to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan. There \r\ncan be no improvement in the situation in Afghanistan \r\nwithout support for the security sector, but that support \r\nis viable only if by improving the security sector there \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

That is the only pathway towards a sustainable \r\nresolution. We saw some very positive signs in the \r\nEid al-Fitr ceasefire this summer. We also saw new \r\ninitiatives being launched at the Geneva Conference. \r\nThe draft resolution before us reiterates the call on the \r\nparties to the conflict to recognize their responsibilities \r\nin achieving peace and to enter into direct talks without \r\npreconditions. That aspect is directed at the Taliban. \r\nAll countries of the regions have to exert their best \r\nefforts in support the peace process.\r\nAlthough Afghanistan has come a long way, \r\nnumerous challenges remain, including the fight \r\nagainst corruption and the fight for good governance \r\nand institution-building. Each is of crucial importance. \r\nI also wish to highlight the importance of women’s \r\nempowerment in the country, including their \r\nparticipation in Government and their education, \r\nspecifically their ability to attend school and university. \r\nI would encourage the Government of Afghanistan to \r\ncontinue to make efforts in those areas and implement \r\nthe announced political and economic reforms.\r\nGermany remains committed to supporting \r\nAfghanistan and the people of Afghanistan, and to \r\ntrying to build an international consensus that the \r\nAfghan population can see. We continue to work \r\nclosely with the Government of Afghanistan and our \r\ninternational partners.\r\nIn conclusion, Germany aligns itself with the \r\nstatement to be delivered on behalf of the European \r\nUnion later in today’s debate.\r\nMr. Saikal (Afghanistan): I would like to thank \r\nthe President for convening today’s meeting on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan as we adopt this year’s draft \r\nresolution on our country (A/73/L.44).\r\nTo begin, let me convey my gratitude to \r\nMr. Christoph Heusgen, Mr. Friedrich Schröder and \r\nthe rest of the team at the German Mission for ably \r\nfacilitating negotiations on the draft resolution. We also \r\nconvey our thanks to all delegations for their proactive \r\nengagement and f lexibility during the course of the \r\ndeliberations. As a result of their efforts, this year’s \r\ndraft resolution reflects the important developments \r\nthat took place during the course of the past year, \r\ncovering the security situation, developments in the \r\narea of peace and reconciliation, the recent Geneva \r\nMinisterial Conference on Afghanistan and, above all, \r\nthe enduring partnership between Afghanistan and the \r\ninternational community on common goals that are \r\nimperative to us all.\r\nAs we take stock of the situation in Afghanistan, \r\na glimpse at the past will benefit our course of action \r\non the way forward towards consolidating gains and \r\nguaranteeing stability and security in the country. \r\nAfghanistan’s geostrategic location in the heart of Asia \r\nhas led to vested interests trying to meddle and interfere \r\nin ways that serve no benefit to anyone. The ensuing \r\nviolence has brought with it untold suffering and \r\ndevastation for our people, resulting in a humanitarian \r\ncrisis and leading to instability in the wider region. \r\nIn the process, our people have resisted and risen up \r\nin defence of the dignity and territorial integrity of \r\ntheir country. Following the end of the former Soviet \r\noccupation and the collapse of the communist regime, \r\nwe witnessed a new era of meddling, which involved the \r\nuse of proxy groups for strategic gains. The challenges \r\nthat we faced then remain evident even today, requiring \r\na new approach designed to change the calculus for \r\nthe benefit of security, not only in Afghanistan but the \r\nwider region.\r\nLooking at where we stand, despite all the prevailing \r\nchallenges, Afghanistan has crossed a threshold and \r\nturned the corner in achieving our goals for security and \r\nself-reliance. This year’s draft resolution exemplifies \r\nthe international community’s commitment to that \r\nimperative, for which we are grateful.\r\nIn the area of security, our national forces are \r\nvaliantly defending our dignity and freedom and, in \r\nthe broader context, fighting to defend global security. \r\nThey have engaged the Taliban and other elements of \r\nthe transnational terrorist network, while adopting an \r\noffensive posture and inflicting heavy losses on those \r\nelements in the battlefield. Despite repeated attempts, \r\nthe Taliban have failed to capture a single province \r\nor city, or to otherwise assert control anywhere in the \r\ncountry. That progress also relates to efforts aimed at \r\ncountering such foreign terrorist fighters as Da’esh, \r\nwhose presence and capacity have been reduced, \r\nincluding in the northern provinces. The Taliban and \r\nother affiliated groups have shifted their focus to \r\nattacking population centres and other soft targets, \r\n06/12/2018 A/73/PV.46\r\n18-41573 3/23\r\nincluding religious sites and gatherings, with a view to \r\nstoking internal tensions.\r\nThe latest such attack was against a group of \r\nreligious scholars last month, where more than 55 were \r\nkilled and over 80 wounded, some severely. Let me \r\nstate once again that such attacks can never undermine \r\nour unity or commitment to a peaceful and democratic \r\nAfghanistan. The sheer number of Afghans who, in \r\ndefiance of terror, came out in waves to stand in lines \r\nfor hours to cast their vote in the recent parliamentary \r\nelections is proof of that.\r\nWe thank all international partners, including \r\nthose in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission, \r\nand other partner nations providing support to further \r\nstrengthen the operational capabilities of our national \r\nsecurity forces. Those investments are for the security \r\nof Afghanistan, the region and beyond.\r\nThe past few months have seen developments in \r\nour peace efforts, which have given a glimmer of hope \r\nfor the course of action we will undertake in future. \r\nFollowing Afghanistan’s submission of a peace plan \r\nwith unconditional talks with the Taliban, in February, \r\nand the Ulema Conferences for Peace and Security in \r\nAfghanistan, held in Kabul and Jakarta, a three-day \r\nceasefire was observed in June. Further progress \r\nwas seen in July, when the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation hosted an International Ulema Conference \r\nin Saudi Arabia that denounced the war in Afghanistan, \r\nthereby leaving no grounds for a religious justification \r\nfor the war. Nevertheless, the Taliban have continued \r\ntheir violence and terror.\r\nDomestically, a national consultative process has \r\nbeen undertaken to ensure that peace efforts have the \r\nfull support across the spectrum of society — political \r\nparties, civil society, tribal elders, religious figures, \r\nand women and youth groups. Less than two weeks \r\nago in Geneva, our road map for achieving peace was \r\npresented. The document aims for a peace agreement \r\nthat will uphold the constitutional rights of all citizens, \r\nespecially women. Moreover, no armed groups with \r\nties to transnational terrorist networks or criminal \r\norganizations and no State or non-State actors seeking \r\ninfluence in Afghanistan will be allowed to join the \r\nprocess. In addition, to make progress on the peace \r\nagenda, an authoritative negotiating team will conduct \r\ndirect negotiations with the Taliban, and we expect \r\nthe same from the Taliban, so that we have a united \r\nnegotiating team.\r\nRegional consensus is imperative for the success of \r\nthat process. We have long asserted that peace is most \r\nachievable when neighbours in the region are on board \r\nand engaged constructively in support of an Afghan-led \r\nand Afghan-owned peace process. While we continue \r\nto lead peace efforts, we also welcome the current \r\nefforts of the United States Special Representative for \r\nAfghanistan Reconciliation, Ambassador Khalilzad, \r\naimed at reaching out to regional players to strengthen \r\nconsensus and facilitate direct peace talks with the \r\nTaliban. We welcome those mechanisms as well \r\nas other initiatives that conform, with and help to \r\nreinforce, our Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace \r\nefforts in line with the Kabul Process for Peace and \r\nSecurity Cooperation.\r\nMoreover, in the context of Afghanistan-Pakistan \r\nrelations, this year’s draft resolution highlights the \r\nsigning in April of the Afghanistan-Pakistan Action \r\nPlan for Peace and Solidarity. That mechanism is aimed \r\nat improving cooperation in addressing outstanding \r\nconcerns related to combating terrorism and outlining \r\nclear measures to advance peace efforts. The effective \r\nimplementation of commitments under the Action \r\nPlan is a crucial imperative. No country can benefit \r\nmore from a peaceful and stable Afghanistan than \r\nPakistan itself.\r\nLast week in Geneva, the international community \r\nand Afghanistan came together to assess our joint \r\nprogress on a wide spectrum of issues that are pivotal for \r\nmy country’s stability. For our part, we spoke about the \r\nprogress we have made in meeting benchmarks set forth \r\nin the national priority programmes of the Self-Reliance \r\nthrough Mutual Accountability Framework. We have \r\nfocused on security-sector, civil-service and fiscal \r\nreform and improved governance and anti-corruption. \r\nThose measures aim to strengthen governance and the \r\nrule of law, subjects at the core of our reform agenda. To \r\nthat end, we have implemented new judicial measures \r\nso as to ensure a society where all individuals — both \r\nin and outside of Government — operate in accordance \r\nwith the laws of the land.\r\nIn the coming years we will remain closely \r\nengaged with international partners to meet reciprocal \r\ncommitments under the Geneva Mutual Accountability \r\nFramework. Mutual progress on those commitments \r\nwill be reviewed through the annual meeting of the Joint \r\nCoordination and Monitoring Board in 2019, which is \r\nmade up of senior officials, and our next ministerial \r\nmeeting, to be held in 2020. As Afghanistan remains \r\nA/73/PV.46 06/12/2018\r\n4/23 18-41573\r\nfully engaged in fulfilling its share of commitments, \r\nwe will strive to maintain continued focus in the \r\nalignment, efficiency and coordination of development \r\naid from international partners.\r\nThis year’s draft resolution highlights once again \r\nthe direct link between regional economic cooperation \r\nand peace, security and stability in Afghanistan and the \r\nregion. In the past year we witnessed ongoing efforts \r\naimed at strengthening connectivity through various \r\nmegaprojects designed to bring transformative change \r\nto the region by linking peoples, cultures, products and, \r\nabove all, our economies, with the aim of achieving \r\nshared prosperity. Our commitment to that endeavour \r\nis manifested by the Afghan-led Regional Economic \r\nCooperation Conference on Afghanistan process, under \r\nwhich progress continues be made on such initiatives as \r\nthe Central Asia South Asia Electricity Transmission \r\nand Trade Project, the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-\r\nPakistan-India Pipeline, the Lapis Lazuli corridor, \r\nthe Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan-Tajikistan-Afghanistan-\r\nPakistan power project, the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-\r\nPakistan 500 kilovolts Line, the Chabahar Port and the \r\nFive Nations Railway Corridor. Among the notable \r\nachievements made this year was the operationalization \r\nof air corridors with the addition of a number of \r\ncountries since last year, leading to increased trade in \r\ngoods and services.\r\nMore broadly, we look forward to working with other \r\nregional and international partners to advance regional \r\ncooperation in the areas of security and social and \r\neconomic development under other regional initiatives, \r\nsuch as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the \r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization, the South Asian \r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation, the Central \r\nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation Programme, the \r\nConference on Interaction and Confidence-Building \r\nMeasures in Asia and others.\r\nAfghanistan is a unique example whereby many \r\ncountries from distinct regions and political blocs \r\nconverged in 2001 to attain a common objective: to \r\ndefeat international terrorism and promote a more \r\nsecure and stable international landscape for all. That \r\nmission began with a strong consensus that cooperation \r\nand collaboration would serve everyone’s interests. \r\nExperience has shown that progress is most tangible \r\nwhen countries of the region and beyond display \r\neffective cooperation in the context of international \r\nengagement in our country. At this critical stage, it is \r\nimperative to regenerate and solidify that consensus \r\nfor the achievement of the goals at hand. In that \r\nrespect, this year’s draft resolution calls for a closer \r\nand more coordinated approach among regional and \r\ninternational stakeholders in advancing peace, security \r\nand prosperity in Afghanistan.\r\nIn conclusion, I urge everyone present here — our \r\nallies and partners at the United Nations — to believe \r\nin the promise and potential of Afghanistan. Together \r\nwe have travelled a long road full of challenges \r\nand sacrifices, yet we have witnessed gains on an \r\nunimaginable scale. As we advance along the road to \r\nsustainable peace, it is time to build on those gains. \r\nI thank our partners for their support for the draft \r\nresolution to be adopted today, as well as for their \r\ncontinued support for Afghanistan.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Vale de Almeida (European Union): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union \r\n(EU) and its 28 member States. The candidate countries \r\nTurkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nMontenegro, Serbia and Albania, the country of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidate Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Georgia, \r\nUkraine and the Republic of Moldova, align themselves \r\nwith this statement.\r\nAllow me to begin by praising the delegation of \r\nGermany and Ambassador Heusgen for their very good \r\nwork in preparing and presenting this important draft \r\nresolution (A/73/L.44).\r\nThe European Union would like to commend the \r\nUnited Nations for the organization and outcome of the \r\nGeneva Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan held \r\non 27 and 28 November. Two years after the Brussels \r\nConference, the international community once again \r\nreaffirmed its support to promoting peace, stability \r\nand prosperity in Afghanistan. The European Union \r\nwelcomes the focus at the Conference on the peace \r\ndimension, an area in which the EU is particularly \r\ninterested and willing to play a role and assume \r\nresponsibilities. At the same time, it was important that \r\nparticipants took stock of the state of implementation \r\nof the Afghan reforms and agreed on concrete \r\nimplementation benchmarks for reform to be met in the \r\ncoming years.\r\nSince the beginning of this year, we have witnessed \r\nimportant developments in Afghanistan that are \r\n06/12/2018 A/73/PV.46\r\n18-41573 5/23\r\nconducive to the start of a peace process. President \r\nGhani’s unprecedented peace offer at the Kabul Process \r\nmeeting in February, the three-day successful ceasefire \r\nin June and the recent plan for peace presented during \r\nthe Geneva Ministerial Conference are key moments \r\nthat illustrate that positive momentum. The European \r\nUnion recognizes the Afghan authorities’ efforts and \r\nthe steps taken towards a lasting political settlement and \r\ninclusive peace agreement based on national consensus. \r\nWith the growing consensus among Afghan, regional \r\nand international stakeholders on the parameters of a \r\npotential peace process, it is now time to build on those \r\npositive elements and start a peace dialogue.\r\nHigh Representative Federica Mogherini \r\nconfirmed at the Geneva Conference the European \r\nUnion’s readiness to play a role in supporting peace \r\ntalks, and she put forward several concrete offers \r\nin that regard. She also emphasized the fact that \r\nthe European Union will always stand strong on \r\nthe protection of fundamental rights, particularly \r\nwomen’s full and equal enjoyment of such rights and \r\nthe rights of children and minorities, which should not \r\nbe sacrificed for the sake of rapid progress on peace, \r\nincluding on constitutional reforms. The European \r\nUnion appreciates the fact that those elements were also \r\nemphasized in many other statements, including those \r\nof the Afghan representatives.\r\nAfghanistan is at a crossroads, and many challenges \r\nstill exist within the country. The security situation \r\nremains fragile, and Afghan civilians — innocent \r\ncitizens — continue to be victims of terrorist attacks. \r\nThere have been internal reforms in many areas, but \r\nmore needs to be done so that they are translated into \r\nvisible progress and made to contribute to building a \r\nsolid, democratic and peaceful society where human \r\nrights and the rule of law are respected, and to make \r\nthem conducive to economic development that offers \r\nincreased opportunities for the Afghan people, in \r\nparticular the younger generation.\r\nFor the European Union’s part, in 2017 we approved \r\nthe EU Strategy on Afghanistan. More recently, in \r\nNovember, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of our \r\nmember States adopted conclusions on Afghanistan, \r\nthereby expressing their firm intention to continue \r\nand enhance the work on the four strands of the EU \r\nStrategy, namely, promoting peace, stability and \r\nregional security; reinforcing democracy, the rule of \r\nlaw and human rights and promoting good governance \r\nand women’s empowerment; supporting economic and \r\nhuman development; and addressing challenges related \r\nto migration and forced displacement. We are continuing \r\nour dialogue with our Afghan partners in each of those \r\nfour areas. In coordination with the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime, the European Union and its \r\nmember States will continue to support strengthening \r\nAfghan and regional efforts aimed at comprehensively \r\nfighting organized crime and reducing drug production, \r\ntrafficking and demand.\r\nThe European Union continues to emphasize the \r\nimportance of protecting human rights and promoting \r\ngood governance, where the implementation of relevant \r\nlegislation remains key, with a particular focus on \r\nsuch areas as eliminating violence against women, \r\nimplementing the national action plan pursuant to \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), protecting \r\nchildren and preventing torture and ill treatment.\r\nWe are pleased that discussions at the Geneva \r\nMinisterial Conference underlined the need for women \r\nto have a greater role in society. Although there has \r\nbeen progress, shortfalls in human rights and equal \r\nopportunity remain. The number of women participating \r\nin national institutions remains limited, and the \r\nimplementation of the agenda set out in resolution \r\n1325 (2000) should not be confined to the Afghan \r\nGovernment; it should also involve civil society. We \r\nsalute the work being undertaken to achieve a national \r\nconsensus by Afghan women on peace, while stressing \r\nthe crucial role women and girls can play in conflict \r\nresolution and peace.\r\nIncreased efforts aimed at implementing reforms \r\nmust continue, especially those related to, the fight \r\nagainst corruption, where there is a strong demand from \r\nthe Afghan population. It will have a positive impact \r\non the economy and the development of the private \r\nsector. Foreign investment and economic development \r\nare heavily dependent on both peace and the continued \r\nimplementation of reforms.\r\nIn support of Afghan reforms, at the margins of \r\nthe Geneva Ministerial Conference, the European \r\nUnion signed a €474 million support package for \r\nAfghanistan, including more than €300 million for the \r\nState-Building and Resilience Contract for Afghanistan \r\n2018-2021. That key initiative affirmed the engagement \r\nand reliability of the European Union as a partner \r\nof Afghanistan. A stable, peaceful and democratic \r\nAfghanistan that respects human dignity is in the \r\ninterest of the European Union.\r\nA/73/PV.46 06/12/2018\r\n6/23 18-41573\r\nThe holding of parliamentary elections on 20 and \r\n21 October was also a positive signal, despite serious \r\ntechnical and logistical difficulties and security \r\nthreats. Many Afghans, including women and young \r\npeople, exercised their democratic right to vote. It is \r\nimportant to now start working on the lessons learned \r\nfrom these elections, in view of next year’s presidential \r\nelections, which are expected to take place according \r\nto schedule. The coming months are essential, as strong \r\nand swift measures that will ensure and preserve the \r\nsafety, transparency, accountability and credibility of \r\nthe ballot need to be taken.\r\nThe European Union will continue to work \r\nalongside the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity in support of the Afghan electoral process. \r\nWe have committed more than €15 million to assisting \r\nthe presidential elections, with the coordination of the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, \r\nand continue to implement the EU-funded Instrument \r\ncontributing to Stability and Peace, which will help \r\nto reduce vulnerabilities in the electoral process, \r\nencourage internal monitoring by civil society \r\norganizations, inclusiveness among the political parties \r\nand women’s participation in the process.\r\nWith regard to migration, in the framework of \r\nthe EU-Afghanistan Joint Way Forward and through \r\nbilateral memorandums of understanding with other \r\nMember States, the European Union and Afghanistan \r\ncontinued their comprehensive dialogue, including on \r\nthe regional dimension of migration. Very recently, \r\nin Brussels, we discussed cooperation in terms of the \r\nJoint Way Forward framework. At the same time, we \r\nare actively engaged in finding lasting solutions for the \r\nAfghan displacement and migration situation, taking \r\ninto consideration, of course, the regional dimension \r\nas well. The latest trends showing decreases in returns \r\nfrom Pakistan are encouraging, as they will allow the \r\nproper reintegration of returnees into Afghanistan. At \r\nthe Geneva Ministerial Conference side event on people \r\non the move, which we co-organized, we also had an \r\nopportunity to discuss and raise awareness about the \r\ndisplacement and migration of Afghan nationals. We \r\nwill continue to support the Afghan Government’s \r\nactions and efforts aimed at reintegrating returned \r\nAfghan nationals, not only from Europe but also from \r\nneighbouring countries.\r\nWe remain deeply concerned about the high number \r\nof civilian casualties and the increasing number of \r\ndisplaced people, and we call on all parties to protect \r\nthe civilian population, especially women and children. \r\nConflict-related violence must not be allowed to destroy \r\nanother generation’s livelihood, homes and property, \r\ndisplacing families and limiting access to education, \r\nhealth care and other services. We need to continue to \r\nprotect the vital role that humanitarian agencies play and \r\nrespect their impartiality and the humanitarian space in \r\nwhich the most urgent needs of the most vulnerable are \r\naddressed. Improving security remains a precondition \r\nfor stability and development in Afghanistan.\r\nIn conclusion, much has been achieved, and the \r\nAfghanistan that we see today is different in so many \r\nways from what it was several years ago. The European \r\nUnion recognizes the progress and reforms made \r\nso far. We strongly support the Afghan authorities \r\nin their pursuit of long-term stability. Afghanistan \r\nneeds to build on the current positive momentum, \r\nstart peace talks and end the conflict that is harming \r\nmany innocent people. The European Union recognizes \r\nthe important work of the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan, and we will continue to work \r\ntogether with the United Nations, as well as regional \r\nand international partners, to support the people and \r\nthe authorities of Afghanistan in their efforts to achieve \r\nlasting peace and stability.\r\nMs. Brink (Australia): Australia is pleased to \r\nco-sponsor draft resolution A/73/L.44 today. We \r\nthank colleagues, particularly those from Germany \r\nand Afghanistan, for the leadership they showed in \r\ndeveloping this year’s draft resolution, which represents \r\na resounding demonstration of continued international \r\nsupport for Afghanistan and its people as they seek \r\nto achieve peace and development. Together with its \r\ninternational partners, Australia remains committed \r\nto Afghanistan’s security and development as it \r\nworks towards self-reliance. We reaffirm Australia’s \r\ncommitment to NATO’s Resolute Support Mission, \r\nwhich is building the capacity of the Afghan security \r\nforces to protect Afghanistan’s future.\r\nThe Australian Government strongly condemns \r\nviolence in Afghanistan, which has continued unabated \r\nin 2018. This year’s increasing toll on civilians is a stark \r\nreminder of the suffering of the Afghan people. We \r\noffer our condolences for those tragic events, including \r\nthe recent conflict in Ghazni and the shocking attacks \r\nin Kabul, which previous speakers have touched \r\nupon. We also honour the sacrifices of members of \r\nthe Afghan security forces, as well as those of NATO \r\nand partner forces who -lost their lives in support of \r\n06/12/2018 A/73/PV.46\r\n18-41573 7/23\r\ntheir Afghan colleagues. Australia supports the Afghan \r\nGovernment’s determined pursuit of peace in 2018, \r\nfrom its February offer to the Taliban of negotiations \r\nwithout preconditions, to its announcement in \r\nNovember of the formation of a negotiating team \r\ntogether with the drafting of negotiating principles. We \r\nalso welcome the outcomes from the November Geneva \r\nMinisterial Conference on Afghanistan, in which the \r\nAfghan Government renewed its commitment to reform \r\nand which enhanced momentum for an Afghan-led and \r\nAfghan-owned peace process.\r\nWe call on the Taliban to commit to a ceasefire and \r\njoin their fellow Afghans, especially the Government \r\nof Afghanistan, at the negotiating table. We reaffirm \r\nAustralia’s support for the Kabul Process and encourage \r\nall parties to use that mechanism to focus their efforts \r\non achieving an inclusive and durable political \r\nsettlement. Durable peace will mean finding ways to \r\npreserve progress, protect rights, provide economic \r\nopportunities and include all of Afghanistan’s people in \r\nits future. Afghanistan’s neighbours have an especially \r\nimportant role to play.\r\nWe welcome the positive steps taken by \r\nAfghanistan and its neighbours through the Regional \r\nEconomic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan \r\nand the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process to facilitate \r\nregional cooperation and encourage sustainable trade \r\nand investment. We encourage enhanced engagement \r\nbetween Afghanistan and Pakistan and urge that priority \r\nbe given to strengthening this bilateral relationship so \r\nas to ensure regional stability. As partners in peace, \r\nthe international community continues to support \r\nAfghanistan’s efforts to establish the conditions that \r\ncan sustain a negotiated settlement. We look forward \r\nto Afghans’ further expressing their commitment \r\nto democracy in the 2019 presidential elections, as \r\nAfghanistan progresses towards self-reliance.\r\nAustralia has provided approximately $1.4 billion \r\nin development assistance since 2001, including a \r\n$5 million contribution for emergency assistance to the \r\nmore than 1 million Afghans who are on the verge of \r\nacute famine. We are meeting our Brussels Ministerial \r\nConference commitments to providing $320 million \r\nfrom 2016 to 2020 and will continue to invest in a \r\nsecure and stable Afghanistan beyond 2020. Together \r\nwith its international partners, Australia stands with \r\nAfghanistan as it charts a course towards a more secure \r\nand prosperous future. We encourage all Member States \r\nto do the same and support the draft resolution.\r\nMs. Gambhir (India): I thank the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for organizing today’s debate. We \r\nwould also like to thank the delegation of Germany \r\nfor facilitating the very important draft resolution \r\ncontained in document A/73/L.44. My delegation \r\nattaches great importance to the consensual adoption \r\nof the General Assembly’s annual draft resolution \r\non Afghanistan, as it is an important opportunity for \r\nthe international community as a whole to express its \r\nsolidarity for peace and stability in Afghanistan.\r\nMany Member States attended the recently \r\nconcluded Geneva Ministerial Conference on \r\nAfghanistan last month, thereby reaffirming the \r\ninternational community’s commitment — as well as \r\nthat of the United Nations — to Afghanistan. As stated \r\nby President Ghani at the Geneva Conference, this \r\nyear reflects how Afghanistan is gaining control of its \r\ndestiny and how Afghans are taking ownership of their \r\nown problems and demonstrating leadership in finding \r\nsolutions. Despite mounting challenges involving \r\nsecurity, peace and development, there was also \r\nconsiderable progress in the past 17 years, especially \r\nin promoting education and health care, protecting \r\nthe rights of women, children and the marginalized, \r\nsafeguarding lives, improving governance and reforms, \r\ngenerating livelihood and moving Afghanistan towards \r\nself-reliance. Democracy in Afghanistan is taking \r\ndeeper roots.\r\nThe enthusiastic participation of the people of \r\nAfghanistan in the parliamentary elections held last \r\nmonth, despite terrorist violence, reflects their desire \r\nfor, and faith in, democratic governance and the \r\nrejection of forces that foment and spread terror and \r\nviolence. The presidential elections scheduled for next \r\nyear should further strengthen democratic institutions. \r\nThose gains, achieved in the face extreme adversity \r\nand violence, demonstrate the indomitable courage and \r\ndetermination of our Afghan friends.\r\nWhile the people of Afghanistan strive for better \r\nlives and a peaceful future, the challenges they face \r\nonly increased in the recent past. According to the \r\nlatest statistics from the Global Terrorism Index, which \r\nwere released this week, Afghanistan is now the world’s \r\ndeadliest country when it comes to terrorism. Sadly, one \r\nquarter of terrorism-related deaths throughout the world \r\nin 2017 occurred in Afghanistan. It is indeed sad that \r\nwe, as the international community, saw it coming. The \r\nrelevant reports of the Secretary-General — year after \r\nyear, month after month — have demonstrated that the \r\nA/73/PV.46 06/12/2018\r\n8/23 18-41573\r\nviolence and terror in Afghanistan have shown no signs \r\nof abating. We have witnessed the increased frequency \r\nof attacks in places where they were never imagined \r\nto be possible before. Even the sick and wounded in \r\nhospitals, young boys and girls in schools, praying \r\ndevotees in mosques and mourners at funerals have not \r\nbeen spared from the forces of terror and violence.\r\nIt is clear that terrorists and those who plan such \r\nattacks are not interested in peace. The goalposts for \r\nthem have changed. Terrorists and their supporters \r\nhave now created among themselves industries \r\ninvolving narcotics and illegal mining in the territories \r\nthat they control, and are stealing the resources of the \r\nAfghan people to fund more violence and terrorism. \r\nDespite those challenges, however, the United Nations \r\nhas not demonstrated the necessary resolve to deal \r\nwith the source of the problem. The Security Council \r\nCommittee established pursuant to resolution 1988 \r\n(2011), which refuses to designate new leaders of the \r\nTaliban or freeze the assets of its slain leader, is falling \r\nshort of what is expected of it by Afghans and the \r\ninternational community. From lessons learned in the \r\npast, we who are situated in New York have become \r\naware that peace in Afghanistan is linked with the \r\npeace and security situation of the entire world.\r\nWhile all of us advocate that there is no military \r\nsolution to the issue, the Taliban — aided by its \r\nsupporters — continues to pursue military operations, \r\nperpetrating violence and destruction, such as the \r\nrecent attack in Kabul and similar ones across other \r\nparts of Afghanistan. Those offensives were planned \r\nand launched by those who have been harboured in \r\nsafe havens in Afghanistan’s neighbourhood. Those \r\nsanctuaries have for years provided safety for the dark \r\nagendas of ideologically and operationally fused terror \r\nnetworks, such as the Taliban, the Haqqani Network, \r\nDa’esh and Al-Qaida, and its proscribed affiliates such \r\nas the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.\r\nWe support an inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-\r\nowned and Afghan-controlled peace and reconciliation \r\nprocess that promotes and protects the unity, \r\nsovereignty, democracy, inclusiveness and prosperity \r\nof Afghanistan. Any meaningful progress towards \r\nsustainable peace requires a cessation of terrorist \r\nviolence, the renunciation of links with international \r\nterrorism and respect for the rights of common Afghan \r\npeople, especially women, children and minorities.\r\nIndia has always stood shoulder to shoulder with \r\nour Afghan friends, and it will continue to do so in \r\nthis transformation decade by providing the assistance \r\nthat Afghanistan needs and seeks. Building reliable \r\nconnectivity for landlocked Afghanistan is a key \r\ncomponent of our regional partnership. In undertaking \r\nthose endeavours, we are mindful of how important \r\nit is that all such projects respect State sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity and be based on universally \r\nrecognized international norms, transparency and the \r\nprinciples of financial responsibility, ecological and \r\nenvironmental protection and preservation standards. \r\nIt is in that spirit that we are engaged in various \r\nconnectivity projects in the region, including the \r\nChabahar Port project and the direct India-Afghanistan \r\nair-freight corridor, which were successfully made \r\noperational in the recent past, and we will continue \r\nto build on the gains achieved. We will continue to \r\nwork with all those who share in the spirit of helping \r\nAfghanistan without conditions.\r\nFrom a young age, Indians are familiar with the tales \r\nof Afghan courage, resilience and determination, which \r\nhave long been a source admiration and inspiration in \r\nour region. We only hope that the courage of Afghans \r\ncan be matched by that of the international community \r\nin doing, for its part, what needs to be done to bring \r\npeace to this war-torn country.\r\nMs. Zahir (Maldives): The Maldives is encouraged \r\nto see the positive steps that Afghanistan is taking \r\ntowards peace and development, despite terrorist \r\nattacks and the continued threat of such attacks. The \r\nGovernment and the people of Maldives support and \r\nshare the vision of a prosperous Afghanistan that is \r\nAfghan-led and Afghan-owned.\r\nThe people of Afghanistan have shown extraordinary \r\nresilience and determination in rebuilding their country. \r\nPresident Ashraf Ghani has shown extraordinary \r\nleadership and courage in promoting democratic values \r\nin the country. The general election held in October \r\nwas one of the most important steps taken in this, \r\nAfghanistan’s transformation decade. Through the \r\nballot box, the people of Afghanistan have consistently \r\nchosen the path of peace, of tolerance over extremism \r\nand of cooperation over confrontation. We especially \r\nwelcome the continued implementation of overlapping \r\nceasefires between the Afghan Government and the \r\nTaliban, which also helps to maintain the peace process \r\nin the country. It is further encouraging to note that \r\nthe process is supported by the increasingly active \r\n06/12/2018 A/73/PV.46\r\n18-41573 9/23\r\nengagement of civil society and religious leaders. Such \r\nengagement of civil society is evidence of signs of \r\nf lexibility among the main parties to the conflict.\r\nThe Maldives Government congratulates President \r\nGhani on his announcement of a unilateral cessation \r\nof hostilities with the Taliban, which was followed \r\nby the Taliban issuing its own ceasefire declaration. \r\nThose positive developments require the support of the \r\ninternational community. Accordingly, the Maldives \r\nreiterates its call on the United Nations and its Member \r\nStates to support Afghanistan in rebuilding the country, \r\nconsolidating the authority of its State and institutions \r\nand helping the Government maintain law and order.\r\nThe progress Afghanistan is making in promoting \r\nhuman rights values in the country, especially for \r\nwomen and girls, is quite remarkable. With an increased \r\nfocus on reducing sexual and gender-based violence, the \r\npeople of Afghanistan can achieve an even more stable, \r\nsecure and equal society. The relatively high level of \r\nparticipation by women in the October general election \r\nwas an encouraging sign. We would like to see that \r\nupward trajectory continue. We would also like to see \r\na greater participation by women in peace negotiations, \r\npeacebuilding and conflict prevention so as to better \r\nsustain peace in the country.\r\nAs we approach the fifth year of the Afghanistan \r\ntransformation decade, the Maldives recognizes \r\nthe progress being made thanks to the successful \r\nimplementation of some of the key components of the \r\naction plan and hopes that the country continues to \r\ntackle the significant and complex challenges related \r\nto insecurity, poverty and corruption. With greater \r\neconomic integration in the region, Afghanistan will \r\nbe able to ensure safety and welfare for its people. \r\nThat requires the full commitment of all partners in \r\nthe region, including the South Asian Association for \r\nRegional Cooperation. The Maldives acknowledges \r\nthe important steps taken by Afghanistan towards \r\nenhancing regional cooperation.\r\nA stable, safe, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan \r\nwill not only benefit the hard-working people of \r\nAfghanistan, but is also of interest to the entire region, \r\nits economic partners and the international community \r\nas a whole. We therefore once again issue a call: let us \r\nstrengthen our efforts to support Afghanistan and make \r\nit the place it deserves to be.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): For the past several decades, \r\nthe people of Afghanistan have experienced epic \r\nsuffering caused by war, internecine conflicts and \r\nforeign interventions in their country. Violence and \r\nturmoil in Afghanistan have not only undermined peace \r\nand security and development in the country and the \r\nregion; they also pose a continuing threat to international \r\npeace and security. Through Afghanistan’s travails and \r\ntragedy, the global community has remained steadfast \r\nin its support for the Afghan people.\r\nApart from Afghanistan itself, it is Pakistan that \r\nhas endured the greatest suffering and damage from the \r\nstrife, violence and instability in Afghanistan and in \r\nour neighbourhood. Despite the many burdens that the \r\nsituation has imposed on my country, our support for our \r\nAfghan brothers and sisters has remained consistent and \r\nresolute. We opened our hearts and homes to millions \r\nof Afghan refugees and have sustained them for almost \r\nfour decades, with less than adequate support from \r\nthe international community. Even today, Pakistan \r\ncontinues to host more than 2 million Afghans — the \r\nlargest protracted presence of refugees anywhere in \r\nthe world.\r\nPakistan has a vital interest in a peaceful, stable, \r\nunited and prosperous Afghanistan. We are working \r\nto strengthen bilateral relations through the recently \r\nagreed Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and \r\nSolidarity, which aims at establishing closer engagement \r\non political, economic, military, intelligence and refugee \r\nissues. We have undertaken a number of initiatives to \r\nsupport Afghanistan’s economic development. Over the \r\npast decade, Pakistan has extended financial assistance \r\nfor various infrastructure and development projects \r\nin Afghanistan. Last year’s waiver of regulatory duties \r\nresulted in a significant increase in the country’s \r\nexports to Pakistan, which remains Afghanistan’s \r\nlargest market.\r\nWe have also taken steps to improve the transit of \r\nAfghan trade through our ports. We look forward to \r\nthe day when transit trade from Central Asia can f low \r\nthrough Afghanistan and Pakistan, the shortest route \r\nto the Arabian Sea. My country is also committed to \r\nseveral regional projects, including Turkmenistan-\r\nAfghanistan-Pakistan-India energy and natural-gas \r\ninitiatives and the Central Asia South Asia Electricity \r\nTransmission and Trade Project, which will contribute \r\nto the economic integration of the entire region and \r\npromote South-South cooperation.\r\nThe level of violence has escalated sharply in \r\nAfghanistan over the past several months. According \r\nA/73/PV.46 06/12/2018\r\n10/23 18-41573\r\nto independent reports, the areas under Taliban \r\ncontrol or influence have become further enlarged. \r\nCivilian and military casualties have mounted owing \r\nto insurgent attacks and coalition air strikes. The \r\nconflict in Afghanistan is clearly expanding, but it has \r\nalso reached a stalemate. It is evident that neither the \r\ncoalition nor the Taliban will be able to impose its will \r\non the other. A negotiated political settlement is the \r\nonly way to end the violence and bloodshed and realize \r\npeace in Afghanistan.\r\nDespite the bleak picture, there are several positive \r\ndevelopments, the most important of which is the now-\r\nclear international consensus that durable peace can be \r\nachieved only through a political settlement. For over \r\ntwo decades, Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Imran Ahmad \r\nKhan Niazi, has repeatedly declared that the war in \r\nAfghanistan can be brought to an end only through a \r\nnegotiated political settlement. We are gratified that is \r\nnow the universal position.\r\nThe second positive development is the willingness \r\nexpressed by President Ashraf Ghani and the \r\nGovernment of National Unity to pursue a negotiated \r\nsettlement in any available modality or format. \r\nWe welcome the nomination of the Government’s \r\nnegotiating team.\r\nThe third positive development is the decision of \r\nthe United States to play an active role in promoting a \r\npolitical settlement and engaging in direct talks with \r\nthe Taliban. A third round of talks about talks is being \r\nconducted by the United States Special Envoy through \r\ndirect dialogue with the Taliban’s representatives in \r\nDoha. In response to President Trump’s request, my \r\ncountry’s Prime Minister has promised to do all we can \r\nto support the process.\r\nThe efforts being made by Russia, China and \r\nother States of the region to promote engagement and \r\ndialogue with and among the Afghan parties represent \r\na fourth positive development. Sustainable peace will \r\nrequire the endorsement of every State in the region.\r\nThe Moscow-format dialogue last month brought \r\nrepresentatives of the Taliban, the Afghanistan High \r\nPeace Council, the United States and key countries of \r\nthe region around the same table to discuss the path \r\nto peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. Taliban \r\nrepresentatives outlined their known position there. \r\nWe hope that, in subsequent talks in various formats, \r\nthe positions of the principal parties will move closer \r\nto convergence.\r\nIt is obvious that the people of Afghanistan \r\ndesperately desire peace and an end to this long war. The \r\nbrief ceasefire observed over the Eid al-Fitr holidays, \r\nthe peace marches and the recent parliamentary \r\nelections in Afghanistan are all signs that embody the \r\npeople’s yearning for peace. Peace will be realized by \r\nbuilding on that palpable desire for peace and putting \r\nan end to the nightmare of war.\r\nBut the challenge ahead lies is translating that \r\nsentiment and the recent positive developments into \r\na serious, sustained and structured peace process. \r\nA diplomatic surge is needed to seize this unique \r\nopportunity. While the onus for seizing this opportunity \r\nrests on the parties directly involved in the Afghan \r\nconflict, Pakistan, for its part, will do whatever it can to \r\nsupport all efforts to launch a sustained peace process.\r\nFinally, let me say that Afghanistan and our region \r\nare at a crucial, critical juncture. The path to peace in \r\nAfghanistan is onerous, but it appears to be achievable. \r\nIt is now for the parties concerned to commit themselves \r\nto working seriously towards a negotiated solution to \r\nthe conflict. That approach offers the best chance to end \r\nthe suffering of the Afghan people and restore peace to \r\nAfghanistan, and stability to the region as a whole.\r\nMr. Hattrem (Norway): I commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the situation in Afghanistan \r\n(A/73/374). The United Nations and the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan have a vital role to \r\nplay in the efforts to promote peace and development. \r\nWe welcome this opportunity to discuss the way ahead \r\nfor Afghanistan.\r\nThere is broad international agreement that the \r\nconflict in Afghanistan can be resolved only by political \r\nmeans. We commend President Ghani’s brave offer to \r\nthe Taliban of peace negotiations without preconditions, \r\nin February. We were encouraged by the fact that \r\nduring the Eid al-Fitr celebrations in June the two \r\nAfghan parties declared unilateral, partly overlapping \r\nceasefires. The ceasefires reduced the suffering of the \r\nAfghan people and were largely welcomed by them.\r\nWe have noted with great interest the efforts by the \r\nUnited States to engage the Taliban in exploratory talks \r\nabout a peaceful solution to the Afghan conflict. We \r\nhave also noted the efforts by partners in the region to \r\nsupport a negotiated solution. Countries in the region \r\nhave a vital role to play in securing long-term stability \r\nand development.\r\n06/12/2018 A/73/PV.46\r\n18-41573 11/23\r\nNorway will continue its efforts to bring the \r\ndifferent parties and other relevant actors together \r\nto find a political solution. However, nothing will \r\nsucceed unless the Afghan parties dedicate themselves \r\nwholeheartedly to reaching a peaceful settlement. We \r\nurge the Taliban to engage the Afghan Government \r\nin negotiations. If a settlement is achieved, the \r\ninternational community must be ready to offer the \r\nnecessary assistance, financially and otherwise, to \r\nsupport its implementation.\r\nWomen play a vital role in efforts to reach a peaceful \r\nsolution. We trust that the protection of women’s rights \r\nwill be a priority in any settlement. Women must be \r\nincluded in all efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement \r\nand in its eventual implementation. We note with \r\nsatisfaction the activism for peace among an increasing \r\nnumber of Afghan women, from the grass-roots level \r\nall the way up to First Lady Rula Ghani.\r\nAt present the security situation remains precarious. \r\nThe Taliban has gained ground. The recent drought has \r\nbrought about great hardship, misery and displacement. \r\nWe condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks \r\nthat have caused the loss of so many civilian lives, \r\nin Kabul and elsewhere. International military and \r\ncivilian assistance remains essential to provide stability \r\nand prevent the spread of violent extremism, which also \r\nposes a threat to international security.\r\nThe Geneva Ministerial Conference last week \r\nrecognized that some important progress has been \r\nmade in terms of good governance, the fight against \r\ncorruption, women’s rights and other important areas. \r\nThe Conference also brought attention to the vast \r\nchallenges that remain and noted room for progress.\r\nNorway commends the brave people who went to \r\nthe polling stations during the recent parliamentary \r\nelections, as well as the Afghan National Defence \r\nand Security Forces, which worked hard to provide \r\nsecurity. However, we cannot disregard the fact that \r\nthere were significant shortcomings. The large number \r\nof complaints and the recent news that the Electoral \r\nComplaints Commission had invalidated the election \r\nresults for the city of Kabul are disturbing. Significant \r\nimprovements must be made before the presidential \r\nelections in April 2019.\r\nOur focus should be on securing a sovereign, \r\nindependent Afghanistan, as enshrined in the Afghan \r\nConstitution. Afghanistan must be able to take care \r\nof its own security and defend itself with its own \r\ndefence forces, without the need for a continued foreign \r\nmilitary presence.\r\nThe Afghan people deserve to live in peace. Let us \r\nall contribute towards that goal.\r\nMr. Sinirlioğlu (Turkey): Turkey is pleased \r\nto co-sponsor the draft resolution before us today \r\n(A/73/L.44). We look forward to its adoption \r\nby consensus.\r\nWe deem this comprehensive draft resolution to be \r\nvery important, as it highlights the achievements and \r\nresponsibilities of both Afghanistan and the international \r\ncommunity. It constitutes a solid manifestation of our \r\njoint support for the people and the Government of \r\nAfghanistan in addressing ongoing challenges.\r\nAfghanistan is continuing its journey of political \r\nand economic transformation. The achievements over \r\nthe past decade, including in the areas of security, \r\ndemocracy, governance and economic development, are \r\npraiseworthy. The holding of parliamentary elections \r\non 20 October was an important step forward.\r\nAfghanistan’s security and stability remain a key \r\npriority. Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace and \r\nreconciliation efforts are crucial to lasting peace and \r\nsecurity in Afghanistan. Long-term strategies and \r\nconsolidated reforms are essential both for maintaining \r\nprogress and addressing challenges in areas such as \r\neducation, health and displacement.\r\nThe region has demonstrated, on various occasions, \r\nits readiness to resolve its own problems and transform \r\ncommon problems into areas of mutual benefit. We \r\nfully support the regional connectivity projects that \r\ncentre around Afghanistan, such as the Lapis Lazuli \r\nTransit, Trade and Transport Route Agreement as well \r\nas the development of air corridors.\r\nWe value bilateral and multilateral dialogue \r\nand cooperation efforts. We welcome the increased \r\nmomentum that has been achieved through the Istanbul \r\nProcess, which is an effective cooperation model capable \r\nof bringing practical solutions to current challenges \r\nin the Heart of Asia region. We will soon host the \r\nannual Ministerial Conference of the Istanbul Process. \r\nBesides our efforts aimed at consolidating regional \r\nownership, we will also continue to lend our support to \r\nAfghanistan’s security as a NATO Framework Nation \r\nand through NATO’s Resolute Support Mission, among \r\nother efforts.\r\nA/73/PV.46 06/12/2018\r\n12/23 18-41573\r\nTurkey will continue its support for the Afghan \r\nGovernment in its endeavours towards peace, stability \r\nand development. Our programme of assistance to the \r\nAfghan people is the most comprehensive development \r\naid we have directed to a single country in our history. \r\nAs of September 2018, 1,056 development projects had \r\nbeen completed. Turkish development assistance to \r\nAfghanistan amounts to approximately $1.1 billion.\r\nThe continued support of the international \r\ncommunity will strengthen the hopes of the Afghan \r\npeople for a bright future. We will always stand by \r\nour Afghan brothers and sisters as long as our help \r\nis needed.\r\nMr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): Peace \r\nand stability in Afghanistan not only concern the \r\nimmediate interests of the Afghan people but also affect \r\nregional security, stability, development and prosperity.\r\nAt present, the security situation in Afghanistan \r\nprovides no grounds for optimism, and the humanitarian \r\nsituation presents multiple challenges. The National \r\nUnity Government is committed to promoting \r\nsocioeconomic development and maintaining peace \r\nand stability. The international community should \r\ncontinue to provide support and assistance to \r\nAfghanistan. \r\nFirst, based on its commitments to promoting \r\npolitical dialogue and the reconciliation process, the \r\ninternational community should support an inclusive \r\npolitical process that is Afghan-led and Afghan-\r\nowned, support the efforts of the Afghan Government \r\nin promoting peace talks, urge the Taliban to return to \r\nthe negotiation table without delay, and help to achieve \r\ncontinuous progress in the reconciliation process. \r\nInternational mechanisms, including the Quadrilateral \r\nCoordination Group — made up of Afghanistan, \r\nPakistan, China and the United States of America — the \r\nKabul process, the Moscow format consultations and the \r\nIstanbul Process, should continue to play their respective \r\nroles, with international support, in order to facilitate \r\nthe peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan \r\nand create a favourable international environment.\r\nA second focus is to improve the security \r\nenvironment and maintain peace and stability in \r\nAfghanistan. Conflicts continued unabated in the \r\ncountry in the first half of this year, and drug-related \r\ncrime remained a serious problem. The Afghan National \r\nDefence and Security Forces (ANDSF) bear the primary \r\nresponsibility for maintaining the country’s peace, \r\nsecurity and stability. The international community \r\nshould enhance coordination and cooperation and \r\ncontinue to support the ANDSF in building its capacity \r\nto respond effectively to such threats as terrorism, \r\ntransnational crimes and drug-trafficking.\r\nThirdly, priority must be given to achieving \r\nindependent development and improving the lives of \r\nthe Afghan people. The successful Geneva Ministerial \r\nConference on Afghanistan held in late November \r\nadopted a series of outcome documents that will \r\ncontribute to the prompt achievement of independent \r\ndevelopment in Afghanistan. The international \r\ncommunity should sustain its attention directed at \r\nimproving lives in the country, provide development \r\nassistance to the Government and the people of \r\nAfghanistan, respect the people’s independent choice \r\nof a political system and development path and offer \r\ntargeted assistance to the Government of Afghanistan \r\nso as to improve governance and development capacity \r\nbased on the country’s development strategy and \r\nspecific needs.\r\nFourthly, we must provide the badly needed aid \r\nsupplies and alleviate the humanitarian situation. The \r\nrecent drought has affected the livelihoods of millions \r\nof Afghan people, exacerbating the already precarious \r\nhumanitarian situation. The international community \r\nshould provide the Afghan people with emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance in terms of production, water, \r\nfood and medical supplies in order to mitigate the \r\nsuffering of the drought-affected population.\r\nAfghanistan and its neighbours need to address \r\nthe issue of the return of 5 million refugees. The \r\ninternational community should continue to provide \r\nhumanitarian support to Afghan refugees as well as \r\ntheir host countries.\r\nChina enjoys long-standing good-neighbourly \r\nrelations with Afghanistan and has consistently \r\nsupported the country’s political process, \r\nreconstruction and development. China has provided \r\nbilateral assistance to help build Afghan capacity to \r\nfight terrorism and supported its national counter-\r\nterrorism efforts through multilateral mechanisms such \r\nas the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral initiative \r\nand the Quadrilateral Cooperation and Coordination \r\nMechanism involving those three countries \r\nand Tajikistan.\r\nThe eighteenth Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation \r\nOrganization (SCO), held in June in Qingdao, China, \r\n06/12/2018 A/73/PV.46\r\n18-41573 13/23\r\nadopted the Qingdao Declaration, reaffirming SCO \r\nsupport for Afghanistan in such areas as security, \r\neconomic development and the fight against terrorism, \r\nextremism, drugs and crime. China has also provided \r\n¥60 million for Afghan drought-relief efforts and an \r\nadditional $1 million to the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees and the World Food \r\nProgramme to help the Afghan people get through this \r\ndifficult period.\r\nChina and Afghanistan continue to actively promote \r\nthe development of the Belt and Road Initiative. Our two \r\ncountries are now connected by regular direct f lights \r\nand freight trains. Afghanistan actively participated \r\nin the inaugural China International Import Expo, \r\nheld last month in Shanghai. Chinese companies have \r\nengaged in the construction of highways and power-grid \r\nprojects in Afghanistan. China will continue to work \r\nwith Afghanistan to earnestly implemente our bilateral \r\nmemorandum of understanding on the Belt and Road \r\nInitiative and further boost Afghanistan’s trade with \r\nregional partners, as well as the country’s infrastructure, \r\ninterconnectivity and socioeconomic development.\r\nAfghanistan boasts geographical and resource \r\nadvantages and broad prospects for regional economic \r\ncooperation. We hope that all relevant countries \r\nwill demonstrate a spirit of participation in broad \r\nconsultations, conscious of joint contributions and \r\nshared benefits, and scale up regional economic \r\ncooperation and interconnectivity to help Afghanistan \r\nbenefit from regional development and build a \r\ncommunity for the common future of humankind.\r\nMrs. Alhefeiti (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, I would like to thank \r\nthe President for having convened this important \r\nmeeting on the situation in Afghanistan. I would also \r\nlike to thank Germany for its efforts in facilitating \r\nconsultations on draft resolution A/73/L.44, which \r\nstresses the importance of continued peace and stability \r\nin Afghanistan.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates strongly believes \r\nthat conflict resolution depends on peaceful means, \r\nespecially dialogue. We therefore fully support the \r\npolitical reconciliation led by the Government of \r\nAfghanistan and commend the efforts of President \r\nAshraf Ghani to ensure the success of the process and \r\nlaunch peace talks. The United Arab Emirates believes \r\nthat the positive participation of all strata of Afghan \r\nsociety, particularly the Taliban, is essential for the \r\nsuccess of those efforts.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates delegation is concerned \r\nby the deterioration in the security situation in \r\nAfghanistan over the past few years, especially in \r\nthe light of the presence of Al-Qaida and Da’esh and \r\nthe continued activities of other criminal and armed \r\ngroups, which have affected the United Arab Emirates. \r\nIndeed, I recall the terrorist attack on a delegation of \r\nEmirati diplomats in Kandahar participating in Emirati \r\nphilanthropic projects for the benefit of the Afghan \r\npeople, which claimed the lives of six Emirati diplomat \r\nmartyrs. That only strengthened our determination \r\nand commitment to fighting terrorism wherever it \r\noccurs. In that regard, we express our solidarity with \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan in its efforts to fight \r\nthat scourge.\r\nMs. Shikongo (Namibia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nWithin the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process on \r\nRegional Security and Cooperation for a Secure \r\nand Stable Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates, \r\nin its capacity as co-chair for counterterrorism \r\nconfidence-building measures, hosted in Abu Dhabi \r\nrecently the seventh Regional Technical Group Meeting \r\non Counter-terrorism Confidence-building Measures \r\nfor the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process, which sought \r\nto enhance regional security cooperation in order to \r\naddress terrorist threats in the context of a security \r\nand counter-terrorism cooperative approach that \r\ncontributes to developing an integrated strategy and \r\nimplementation plan related to confidence-building \r\nmeasures in the area of counter-terrorism.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is eager to help the Afghan \r\npeople to achieve their vision of peace, stability and \r\nprosperity. We are therefore committed to supporting \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan and its efforts to pursue \r\nlarge-scale economic, social and political reforms, \r\nespecially by enhancing the role of women and youth \r\nin Afghanistan to achieve development and strengthen \r\nAfghan society’s capacity to undertake those reforms.\r\nThe efforts of the United Arab Emirates to achieve \r\ndevelopment and stability in Afghanistan take the form \r\nof humanitarian and development initiatives. Emirati \r\nassistance between 2012 and 2017 totalled $433 million. \r\nThat assistance was used mainly for education, health \r\ncare and women’s empowerment. In the presence of the \r\nAfghan President, a housing project was also launched \r\nA/73/PV.46 06/12/2018\r\n14/23 18-41573\r\nin Kabul early this year at a cost of 710 million Emirati \r\ndirham. The United Arab Emirates has consistently \r\nprovided financial assistance for the rebuilding of \r\nschools, medical facilities and roads, and for ensuring \r\nrelief aid for those affected by disasters.\r\nBased on our policy of respect for the nationals of \r\ncountries aff licted by wars or disasters, my country’s \r\nGovernment decided in June to grant the nationals of \r\nsuch countries one-year renewable residency while \r\nthey are unable to return home. That demonstrates \r\nour solidarity with those people. We also support their \r\nliving conditions so that they will eventually be able to \r\ngo back to their countries. The United Arab Emirates \r\ncontinues to urge neighbouring countries hosting \r\nAfghan nationals not to exploit them in regional issues \r\nand conflicts that have nothing to do with them.\r\nIn conclusion, The United Arab Emirates enjoys \r\nstrong relations with the people of Afghanistan, bound \r\nby history, traditions and common culture. We will \r\ncontinue to provide the necessary assistance to the \r\nAfghan people out of our human and Islamic duty \r\nthrough bilateral or multilateral cooperation.\r\nMr. Cooreman (Belgium): Like others, I would \r\nlike to thank all delegations that participated in the \r\nconsultations on draft resolution A/73/L.44, in particular \r\nmy Afghan and German colleagues for having so ably \r\nfacilitated the negotiations. We are proud to co-sponsor \r\nthe draft resolution and look forward to its adoption.\r\nBelgium associates itself fully with the statement \r\nof the European Union.\r\nAfghanistan has made considerable political, \r\nsecurity, economic and development progress over the \r\npast decade. The draft resolution before us highlights \r\nmany of those advances, for which the Government \r\nof Afghanistan and the Afghan people deserve much \r\ncredit. But the gains made are fragile and major \r\nchallenges remain. I would like to stress three points.\r\nFirst, Afghanistan has had a momentous year, \r\nand an even more momentous year lies ahead of \r\nus. Belgium congratulates the Afghan authorities \r\non the parliamentary elections held on 20 October, \r\nwhich marked another important step towards the \r\nconsolidation of democracy in the country. At the \r\nsame time, it is important to draw lessons from these \r\nelections. The Afghan Government and institutions \r\nowe it to the brave and courageous Afghan citizens \r\nto hold orderly, inclusive and credible presidential \r\nelections in 2019. The election commissioners must \r\nretain their independence and carry out their crucial \r\nmandate autonomously, building on the experience \r\nthey have acquired. Together with the serious security \r\nthreat, logistical and technical difficulties must also \r\nbe addressed.\r\nThe heinous attacks against schools and medical \r\nfacilities during the run-up to the elections further \r\nreminded us of the importance of fully respecting \r\ninternational humanitarian law. In that regard, Belgium \r\nremains deeply concerned about the high number of \r\ncivilian casualties and calls on all parties to protect the \r\ncivilian population, especially women and children.\r\nThe momentous year ahead also applies to my \r\nsecond point, concerning the peace process. The draft \r\nresolution justly stresses the importance of an Afghan-\r\nled and Afghan-owned peace process. The international \r\ncommunity must be united in supporting those national \r\nefforts. There are different processes aiming to build \r\npeace in Afghanistan, but it remains essential for the \r\ninternational community to ensure that all efforts \r\nreinforce each other in a streamlined process. Only \r\nthe Kabul Process can act as a central framework in \r\nthat respect. Belgium calls on the Taliban leadership \r\nto respond to President Ghani’s unprecedented peace \r\noffer and engage in direct peace talks. The impatience \r\nof the Afghan people for peace is ever clearer. The \r\ninternational community must heed its call and support \r\nthe process by acting in unison. That will also require \r\ncontinued support from donors.\r\nThirdly, I want to add Belgium’s voice to the \r\nchoir of global support for Afghanistan. I believe that \r\ntoday is about coming together and uniting behind \r\nour support for progress, sustainable peace and \r\ndevelopment. That is the fundamental value of the draft \r\nresolution we will adopt today, and it was also visible \r\nat the Geneva Ministerial Conference last week, where \r\nwe had an open and constructive dialogue with the \r\nAfghan Government and the international community \r\nconfirmed its continuing support to the necessary \r\nreform and modernization of Afghanistan, including \r\nthe strengthening of the rule of law.\r\nBelgium is a steadfast ally of Afghanistan through \r\nour membership of the European Union and NATO. \r\nBoth entities have longstanding cooperation agreements \r\nwith Afghanistan, to which Belgium fully subscribes. \r\nEarlier this week, the Belgian Government decided to \r\nsubstantially increase its contribution to the NATO \r\n06/12/2018 A/73/PV.46\r\n18-41573 15/23\r\nResolute Support Mission and to help train the Afghan \r\nnational army. We are also supporting the humanitarian \r\nresponse to the drought through our contributions to \r\nthe United Nations Central Emergency Response \r\nFund. Belgium will substantially increase its support \r\nto the Fund over the next two years, in line with our \r\ncommitment to humanitarian principles.\r\nMr. Gertze (Namibia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nI am also proud to share a new Belgian contribution \r\nto the Afghanistan country office of UN-Women in \r\nsupport of its programme to help with the implementation \r\nof the national action plan on women and peace and \r\nsecurity. Belgium attaches great importance to women’s \r\nrights and women’s empowerment. We welcome the \r\nstrong emphasis the draft resolution places on those \r\nthemes. We encourage the Government of Afghanistan \r\nto redouble efforts towards greater participation by \r\nwomen in public institutions.\r\nI also want to express my appreciation for the \r\nimportant work of the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan. Belgium will continue to work \r\nwith the United Nations and regional and international \r\npartners to support the efforts of the Afghan authorities \r\nand people to achieve peace and prosperity.\r\nLet me conclude by paying my respects to the \r\nvictims of the violence in Afghanistan and paying \r\ntribute to the resilience of the Afghan people and the \r\nAfghan National Defence and Security Forces. The year \r\n2018 holds the terrible record of being the most deadly \r\nyear for civilians to date. Ten thousand lives have \r\nbeen lost sinc 2001, including those of many children. \r\nHaving served in Afghanistan myself, that suffering is \r\nclose to my heart. But peace is possible in Afghanistan, \r\nand Belgium will maintain its support not only for an \r\nAfghan-led and Afghan-owned peace settlement but \r\nalso for the journey after such a settlement. That is why \r\nwe are here today.\r\nMs. Boucher (Canada): I would like to sincerely \r\nthank Germany for the continuing engagement and \r\nleadership it has demonstrated in preparing this \r\nyear’s draft resolution on the situation in Afghanistan \r\n(A/73/L.44). I would also like to express my appreciation \r\nto the Permanent Representative of Afghanistan to the \r\nUnited Nations for his thoughtful statement outlining \r\nnot only the important challenges facing his country \r\nbut also its real potential.\r\nAs he has shown, now more than ever the \r\ninternational community must stand side-by-side \r\nwith Afghanistan as it pursues its efforts to create a \r\nsustainable future and a country that is well-governed, \r\nrespects human rights and is in control of its own \r\ndestiny. In that regard, I want to highlight the important \r\nrole of Afghanistan’s neighbours in supporting peace \r\nefforts and improving interconnectivity and promoting \r\neconomic development opportunities with Afghanistan.\r\nThe draft resolution before us today demonstrates \r\nthe importance of international commitment and \r\ncollaboration. It also emphasizes the leadership role \r\nof the Government of Afghanistan and its people in \r\nbuilding a brighter future. That is why we are proud to \r\nco-sponsor this draft resolution, the precursors of which \r\nthe Assembly has traditionally adopted by consensus.\r\nThe recent Geneva Ministerial Conference on \r\nAfghanistan provided further testament of the world’s \r\ncontinuing support. It successfully highlighted \r\nthe solidarity of the international community with \r\nthe Afghan people and the Afghan Government in \r\ntheir efforts to bring peace and prosperity to their \r\ncountry. We were also pleased to learn of the Afghan \r\nGovernment’s renewed commitment to ensuring \r\nprogress on development and reform, which are crucial \r\nbuilding blocks to enable stability and prosperity for \r\nthe country.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada is proud of its longstanding security \r\ncommitment to Afghanistan. We are proud of our support \r\nfor the Afghan peace and reconciliation process. We are \r\nalso proud of the significant efforts we have made for \r\nAfghan women and girls. That sense of pride is rooted \r\nin our belief that, by helping Afghanistan build a more \r\nstable, secure and democratic country that respects \r\nhuman rights, especially those of Afghan women and \r\ngirls, not only are we contributing to the development \r\nof the Afghan people, but also helping to create a safer \r\nand more prosperous world.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAfghanistan recently went through an important \r\ndemocratic process with the October 2018 parliamentary \r\nelections. I commend the bravery of the Afghan people \r\nwho, defying intimidation and threats of violence, went \r\nto the polls to cast their votes. I also want to recognize \r\nthe courage of the Afghan electoral officials and \r\nsecurity-sector personnel supporting the elections. We \r\nA/73/PV.46 06/12/2018\r\n16/23 18-41573\r\nnow look forward to free and fair presidential elections \r\nin Afghanistan in 2019. That will be another major \r\nmilestone for the country.\r\nWe hope that the lessons learned from the \r\nOctober 2018 parliamentary elections can be applied \r\nin 2019. In particular, Canada will continue to work \r\ntogether with its Afghan and international partners to \r\nensure the meaningful participation of all Afghans, \r\nparticularly Afghan women, in the electoral process. \r\nCanada supports an inclusive Afghan-led and Afghan-\r\nowned peace process in which Afghan women play a \r\nmeaningful leadership role. We know that sustainable \r\npeace and security cannot be achieved without the \r\nactive and substantive participation of all members of \r\nsociety, including women and girls.\r\nCanada supports this draft resolution, and we stand \r\nwith the Afghan people as they strive for a more secure, \r\nprosperous and peaceful future.\r\nMr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): To recover \r\nfrom decades of insecurity and instability, Afghanistan \r\nneeds strong and sustained international support. \r\nIn that context, we underline the importance of the \r\nrecent Geneva Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan. \r\nIt demonstrated the international community’s \r\nunwavering support for, and strong solidarity with, \r\nthe people and the Government of Afghanistan in their \r\nendeavour to achieve peace, stability and prosperity.\r\nWe have witnessed a number of promising \r\ndevelopments in Afghanistan this year. The holding \r\nof the parliamentary elections, despite all security \r\nthreats and plots, was a positive development. Indeed, it \r\nfurther consolidates the foundations of democracy and \r\nthe rule of law in the country. We express our sincere \r\ncongratulations to the people and the Government \r\nof Afghanistan for that achievement. It must be \r\ncomplemented by the upcoming presidential elections \r\nin April 2019. The Islamic Republic of Iran stands \r\nready to extend all possible assistance to the brotherly \r\ncountry of Afghanistan to hold that election in a free \r\nand fair manner.\r\nRecent developments in Afghanistan include the \r\nrenewed efforts for peace and reconciliation. As it stands, \r\nthere is a strong national, regional and global consensus \r\nthat there is no military solution in the country. The \r\ntime is therefore ripe for national reconciliation and \r\nan inclusive political solution in Afghanistan. That \r\nshould be owned and led by the Afghan Government \r\nand people. The complementary Kabul, Tashkent and \r\nMoscow formats attest to that momentum, which must \r\nbe seized.\r\nThe international community should facilitate \r\nintra-Afghan dialogue by helping to bring the Taliban \r\nto the negotiating table for inclusive and comprehensive \r\ntalks with the Government. Genuine and strong \r\ninternational support as well as domestic and regional \r\ninclusion will be key to success.\r\nMoreover, if they are to lead to a durable solution, \r\nsuch efforts must be inclusive and based on existing \r\npolitical foundations, such as the Constitution. More \r\nimportant, they should take into account the underlying \r\ncauses of instability and insecurity in the country \r\nover the past four decades. One of those causes has \r\nbeen the presence of foreign forces, which have never \r\nbrought stability to Afghanistan or our region; rather, \r\nhistorically, they have provided a recruiting ground for \r\nextremists. That is why we have never believed that such \r\nforces contribute to Afghanistan’s peace and stability.\r\nOur support to the annual General Assembly \r\nresolution on the situation in Afghanistan reflects our \r\ngenuine and general support for a neighbouring country \r\nand should not be misinterpreted as according any sort \r\nof acknowledgement to, or support for, the continued \r\npresence or activities of foreign forces in that country. \r\nOn the contrary, in our view, the best contribution \r\nthat foreign forces could make towards peace and \r\nstability in Afghanistan would be to withdraw. We \r\ntherefore continue to call strongly for a time-bound \r\nand responsible withdrawal of all foreign forces from \r\nAfghanistan, regardless of their mandate or structure.\r\nInstead of deploying foreign forces, every \r\neffort should be made to support and strengthen \r\nAfghanistan’s military and security forces. That is one \r\nof the main requirements for the long-term stability \r\nof Afghanistan, and should therefore be pursued as a \r\nhigh priority. It is essential in particular for combating \r\nterrorist groups, such as Da’esh, whose introduction into \r\nAfghanistan has led to more bloodshed and dangerous \r\nsectarian tendencies.\r\nWe have stated time and again that no one has \r\ngained from introducing and supporting Da’esh and \r\nother terrorists in Syria and Iraq. No one will gain from \r\nintroducing them in Afghanistan and Central Asia. \r\nThis alarming and horrific trend needs to be stopped \r\nbefore it reaches catastrophic proportions. One of the \r\nmain factors in that regard should be a two-pronged \r\nstrategy to fight both drug-trafficking and terrorism \r\n06/12/2018 A/73/PV.46\r\n18-41573 17/23\r\nsimultaneously. That is crucial, since terrorism and \r\ndrug trafficking have historically always been mutually \r\nreinforcing in Afghanistan.\r\nAt the same time, to fight the drug menace, we \r\nneed a comprehensive strategy, which must include the \r\neconomic development of Afghanistan’s rich resources. \r\nTo that end, the international community should \r\ncontinue to support the ongoing efforts of the people \r\nand the Government of Afghanistan to make optimal \r\nuse of its existing economic opportunities.\r\nAs a brotherly country, Iran has offered \r\nunprecedented support to the Afghan people over the \r\npast 40 years, including by hosting almost 4 million \r\nAfghan refugees. We are ready to continue to help our \r\nAfghan brothers and sisters in their quest for peace and \r\ncooperation with all, based on our shared objectives.\r\nTo support the sustainable socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment of Afghanistan, efforts are under way in \r\nmy country to ensure that contributions are provided in \r\na sustained and institutionalized manner. Connectivity \r\nis a vital element in that regard, and Iran’s sea and \r\nrail links, including Chabahar, are essential for \r\nAfghanistan’s development. Taking into account the \r\nunlawful unilateral sanctions against Iran, we would \r\nlike to stress that any attempt to disrupt this vital \r\nproject will only play into the hands of those who do \r\nnot want peace and progress for Afghanistan.\r\nWe support the efforts of the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan and underline \r\nthe need for a strong partnership between United \r\nNations agencies and that country. We highlight the \r\nimportance of the adoption of the annual General \r\nAssembly resolution on the situation in Afghanistan. \r\nAs it represents the international community’s strong \r\nsupport for Afghanistan, the resolution should be \r\nbalanced, reflect the current situation on the ground \r\nand include the concerns of all. That is vital to ensuring \r\nthat its content enjoys the unambiguous support of all \r\nMember States.\r\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming the resolve of \r\nthe people and the Government of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran to continue their support to the fraternal people \r\nand the Government of Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Islam (Bangladesh): The delegation of \r\nBangladesh wishes to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis comprehensive report on Afghanistan (A/73/374).\r\nBangladesh remains encouraged by the \r\ninternational community’s commitment of constant \r\nsupport for sustained peace and stability in Afghanistan. \r\nThe Security Council’s visit to the country from \r\n13 to 15 January was an affirmation of the international \r\ncommunity’s continued support for a peaceful, secure, \r\nstable and prosperous Afghanistan.\r\nWe followed with interest the Geneva Ministerial \r\nConference on Afghanistan held on 27 and \r\n28 November, at which the Government of Afghanistan \r\nreaffirmed its commitment to reform, democratic \r\nprocesses and development for the Afghan people. \r\nBangladesh welcomes the joint communiqué and the \r\nGeneva Mutual Accountability Framework agreed in \r\nGeneva. We underscore the primacy of an Afghan-led \r\nand Afghan-owned process, supported by enhanced \r\nregional and international cooperation, for lasting \r\npeace and stability in the country.\r\nBangladesh welcomes the achievements of the \r\nNational Unity Government in the political, governance, \r\neconomic and social spheres. We commend initiatives \r\nto promote the enhanced participation of women \r\nand young people in addressing peace, security and \r\ndevelopment issues.\r\nWe congratulate the Afghan Government and \r\npeople on the parliamentary elections held in October, \r\nin defiance of terrorist threats and attacks in various \r\nparts of the country. We, along with the international \r\ncommunity, look forward to the holding of the \r\npresidential elections scheduled for April 2019.\r\nBangladesh attaches importance to demonstrable \r\nefforts by the United Nations to promote peace and \r\nsecurity, development and human rights in Afghanistan. \r\nWe express our support for the sustained engagement of \r\nthe Secretary-General and his Special Representative \r\nfor Afghanistan. We appreciate the work of the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan \r\npursuant to Security Council resolution 2405 (2018). \r\nBangladesh wishes to see the safe, voluntary and \r\ndignified return of Afghan refugees and encourages the \r\ncontinued implementation of the resolution, taking into \r\nconsideration the realities on the ground.\r\nBangladesh unequivocally condemns all terrorist \r\nattacks in Afghanistan and expresses its steadfast \r\nsolidarity with its Government and people. We share \r\nconcerns at the presence of terrorist groups aiming \r\nto spread and consolidate their network across the \r\nregion and beyond. We remain particularly alert to the \r\nA/73/PV.46 06/12/2018\r\n18/23 18-41573\r\nreported presence of foreign terrorist fighters and the \r\ninvolvement of terrorist groups in narcotics cultivation \r\nand trafficking. Bangladesh acknowledges the valiant \r\nrole played by the Afghan National Defence and \r\nSecurity Forces in the face of such risks and urges the \r\ninternational community to maintain support for their \r\ncapacity-building efforts. We stand ready to cooperate \r\nwith the relevant Afghan authorities to share information \r\nand experience, including under relevant regional \r\narrangements. As a matter of principle, Bangladesh \r\nremains committed not to allow its territory to be use \r\nfor terrorist or otherwise hostile activities against any \r\ncountry, including those in our region.\r\nUnder the leadership of Honourable Prime \r\nMinister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh continues to \r\nattach the highest priority to further strengthening and \r\nconsolidating bilateral relations with its neighbours in \r\nSouth Asia. Considering that development in education, \r\nhealth and agriculture is vital in realizing peace, we \r\nare willing to share our development experiences \r\nwith Afghanistan in various areas, namely, women’s \r\nempowerment, non-formal education, community \r\nhealth care, water and sanitation, human resources \r\ndevelopment, judicial system reform and social \r\nand humanitarian programmes. We have offered to \r\nprovide training to help Afghan professionals and \r\nofficials develop the necessary skills in areas such \r\nas the financial, judicial and administrative sectors, \r\ndisaster management, agricultural extension and \r\nyouth development.\r\nBangladesh and Afghanistan are currently working \r\nto further their existing bilateral relations through \r\ninstitutional frameworks such as foreign office \r\nconsultations, trade agreements, cultural exchanges, \r\nvisa waivers for Government officials and air services \r\nagreements. Bangladesh also offers scholarships to \r\nstudents from Afghanistan to study medicine and other \r\nhigher degree subjects.\r\nSince we believe in the potential of regional \r\nconnectivity as the key for ensuring growth and \r\neliminating poverty, we feel encouraged by various \r\ninitiatives of countries in the region to unlock the \r\ntrade and transit potential that Afghanistan offers as \r\na connectivity hub. Drawing on Bangladesh’s recent \r\ninitiatives at fostering subregional connectivity, we \r\nlook forward to broadening this template to enter into \r\nbeneficial regional connectivity arrangements with \r\nother South and Central Asian countries.\r\nIn 2002, Building Resources Across Communities, \r\nthe largest non-governmental organization in \r\nBangladesh, began its first international operation in \r\nAfghanistan. It has since continued to play a significant \r\nrole by providing secondary, higher secondary, \r\ntechnical and vocational education and community \r\nhealth services, working with local authorities to \r\nbuild rural infrastructure and helping to implement \r\nsocial-development projects in many provinces and \r\nhard-to-reach communities. That development approach \r\nimproves participation, raises awareness of gender \r\nequality and child rights and encourages ownership by \r\nthe community.\r\nWe stress the importance of maintaining the unity \r\nof purpose of Member States in contributing to lasting \r\npeace and sustainable development in Afghanistan. \r\nThe legitimate aspirations of the Afghan people must \r\ntake precedence over external considerations. The \r\ndraft resolution before us should reflect our collective \r\ncommitment to that effect, and we thank the German \r\ndelegation for facilitating its preparation.\r\nMr. Camp (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States welcomes draft resolution A/73/L.44, \r\non Afghanistan, which we were happy to co-sponsor. \r\nMy country seeks an inclusive peace that will benefit \r\nall Afghan men and women. We seek a peace in which \r\nAfghanistan plays its rightful and obligatory role, \r\ncontributing to international security and ensuring that \r\nits territory is no longer exploited by terrorists. And \r\nwe seek a peace that accelerates economic growth and \r\nprosperity for Afghanistan and its neighbours.\r\nThere are encouraging signs: the National Unity \r\nGovernment’s invitation to the Taliban to enter \r\npeace talks without preconditions; the Government’s \r\nestablishment of an action plan and road map and \r\nappointment of an inclusive negotiating team; and the \r\nEid al-Fitr ceasefire, the first of its kind in 17 years, \r\nalthough followed by the Taliban’s disappointing \r\nfailure to accept a second ceasefire during Eid al-Adha. \r\nA Taliban commitment to a peaceful outcome is long \r\noverdue. We call on the Taliban to commit to a ceasefire \r\nand appoint an authoritative negotiating team.\r\nFor our part, the United States continues its support \r\nfor an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned process. Peace \r\nin Afghanistan is possible, and we must all seize this \r\nopportunity. Today we reaffirm our commitment to the \r\nAfghan people and welcome the progress that has been \r\nmade and will be made in the future.\r\n06/12/2018 A/73/PV.46\r\n18-41573 19/23\r\nMr. Allen (United Kingdom): The United Kingdom \r\nurges the General Assembly to provide its full support \r\nto the Government of Afghanistan and to the draft \r\nresolution before us (A/73/L.44). We commend the \r\nefforts of our German colleagues as penholders on the \r\ndraft resolution, which we believe should command \r\nbroad agreement and consensus as in previous years. \r\nThe United Kingdom remains committed in our \r\nsupport for the Government of Afghanistan along \r\nwith the international community, as demonstrated at \r\nthe Geneva Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan \r\nlast week.\r\nThe draft resolution recognizes the importance of \r\nan Afghan-led and Afghan-owned political process, for \r\nthe benefit of the people of Afghanistan. We agree with \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan that that is the only \r\nway to deliver a just and lasting peace, and believe that \r\nall present today should give it their full support.\r\nThe bravery and determination of the Afghan \r\npeople in participating in the parliamentary elections in \r\nOctober confirm the demand for a political environment \r\nin which all citizens have an equal opportunity to have \r\ntheir say on the future of their country. The elections \r\nalso demonstrated yet again the resilience, tenacity and \r\ncourage of the people of Afghanistan. We welcome the \r\ninclusion in the draft resolution of language that pays \r\ntribute to those who defied threats and intimidation to \r\nexercise their democratic rights.\r\nNevertheless, a number of technical and logistical \r\nproblems arose in the elections that are of concern. It is \r\nvital that Afghanistan’s electoral management bodies \r\nlearn from the experience and implement reforms ahead \r\nof next year’s presidential elections to ensure that such \r\nproblems do not reoccur.\r\nAs Afghanistan continues to develop its \r\ninstitutions, we welcome the importance placed by \r\nthe draft resolution on the successful efforts of the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan to deliver on its reform \r\nagenda. As the international community discussed in \r\nGeneva, there have been notable successes, including \r\non fiscal sustainability, improved budgeting and the \r\nprogress this year against the ease-of-doing-business \r\nindicators. That will all help lead Afghanistan towards a \r\ncollective vision of self-reliance. However, it is vital for \r\nthe pace of reform to accelerate and continue through \r\nthe upcoming election period.\r\nFor peace to be sustainable, it must be inclusive. \r\nAs such, we are extremely encouraged by the multiple \r\nreferences to the protection and empowerment of \r\nwomen and girls in the draft resolution. In particular, \r\nwe welcome the inclusion of paragraph 35, which \r\ncommends the Government of Afghanistan on its work \r\ntowards ensuring the full and equal participation of \r\nwomen in all spheres of life in Afghanistan. That vital \r\nwork ranges from the implementation of Afghanistan’s \r\n2015 national action plan on women and peace and \r\nsecurity to the representation of women on the High \r\nPeace Council and, most recently, to the inclusion of \r\nwomen on President Ghani’s proposed negotiating team \r\nfor peace talks.\r\nIn conclusion, we urge that the Assembly give its \r\nfull support to the draft resolution and its endorsement \r\nof the importance of respect for human rights and of a \r\npolitical settlement to end the violence in Afghanistan.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. We shall now proceed \r\nto consider draft resolution A/73/L.44.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to delegations that wish to \r\nspeak in explanation of vote before the voting, I would \r\nlike to remind delegations that explanations are limited \r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats. \r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nRussian Federation.\r\nMr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian Federation attaches particular \r\nimportance to the situation in Afghanistan and to the \r\nadoption by the General Assembly of draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.44, whose text must be based on a thorough \r\nanalysis, take into account the current realities and \r\nreflect collective approaches by the international \r\ncommunity to find effective and lasting solutions to the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan.\r\nInstead of that, for the first time in some years, the \r\nconsultations on the draft text ignored not just regional \r\ndynamics but also a number of principled Russian \r\nconcerns that it would have been no trouble to consider. \r\nGiven the lack of consensus, we propose that the draft \r\nresolution be put to a vote, since we cannot support \r\nit. The text has a great deal to say about the progress \r\nthat has been made in normalizing the situation in the \r\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan, when the real situation \r\nin the country is actually quite different, as the Security \r\nCouncil mission to Kabul in particular confirmed. We \r\nhave seen the situation deteriorate year after year, \r\nA/73/PV.46 06/12/2018\r\n20/23 18-41573\r\nand frankly we have a host of questions about who is \r\nresponsible for the current situation in Afghanistan. \r\nWe still have not received any objective reports on the \r\nconcrete outcomes of the international coalition’s 17-\r\nyear battle against terrorism and drug trafficking. It is \r\nregrettable that during the work on the draft resolution \r\na number of delegations simply ignored the objective \r\nreality of the growing threat that the Islamic State in \r\nIraq and the Levant (ISIL) poses to security not just \r\nin Afghanistan but its neighbours, including States in \r\nCentral Asia, despite the fact that the presence of ISIL’s \r\nfighters is a harsh reality that must not be downplayed \r\nor merely ignored.\r\nWe were disappointed by a number of delegations’ \r\nunwillingness to take objective account of the role \r\nand outcomes of the Moscow format consultations, \r\nwhich have become an important platform for \r\nlaunching focused negotiations to advance the \r\nnational reconciliation process. Among other things, \r\non 9 November an important meeting took place in \r\nMoscow between representatives of Kabul and the \r\nTaliban. In our view, that represents an unwillingness \r\nto genuinely help shift the efforts to mobilize the \r\nintra-Afghan dialogue to a practical level. We firmly \r\nbelieve that our common task, in agreeing on the kind of \r\ntexts dealing with regional crises such as the conflict in \r\nAfghanistan, should first and foremost be to avoid gaps \r\nbetween United Nations decisions and the realities of \r\na region. This unwillingness to reflect the real picture \r\nwill lead to a dead end that will not only not promote \r\na settlement but will undermine confidence in the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s decisions. For future consultations \r\non draft resolutions, we would like to once again ask \r\npenholders to take objective account of the principled \r\ncomments and concerns of all delegations, not just \r\nspecific countries.\r\nIn conclusion, we should emphasize that the \r\nRussian delegation has actively and consistently \r\nsupported the Afghan people’s desire for lasting peace \r\nin their country. Russia and Afghanistan are bound \r\nby time-tested friendly relations that correspond to \r\nour countries’ national interests and promote stable, \r\nmultifaceted development in the whole region and the \r\nworld in general.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the heroism and courage of \r\nAfghanistan’s armed forces and pay due tribute to all \r\nwho have died fighting terrorist threats. However, it \r\nwill be impossible to stabilize Afghanistan and resolve \r\nits problems without a comprehensive approach on \r\nthe part of the international community. We are ready \r\nto continue to work to improve the coordination of \r\nall States’ action in the interests of ensuring peace \r\nin Afghanistan.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the voting. \r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of \r\nAfghanistan on a point of order.\r\nMr. Saikal (Afghanistan): I take the f loor to \r\nexplain our position on the proposal of the Russian \r\ndelegation. Our delegation would like to express its \r\ndeep regret at the Russian delegation’s request for a \r\nvote on this year’s draft resolution (A/73/L.44) on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan.\r\nThe resolution on the situation in Afghanistan \r\nhas been adopted by consensus every year since its \r\ninclusion on the agenda of the General Assembly. In \r\nthe past few years it has continued to garner strong \r\nconsensus support in the General Assembly, reflecting \r\nthe international community’s commitment to assisting \r\nour people in overcoming decades of conflict and \r\nachieving a durable peace and stability.\r\nAs always, the negotiations on this year’s draft \r\nresolution were inclusive and ably led by the delegation \r\nof Germany as facilitator. During the course of \r\nnegotiations, delegations presented views and proposals \r\nthat were carefully considered and deliberated on. \r\nThe various stakeholders, particularly Afghanistan, \r\ndemonstrated a great degree of f lexibility in order \r\nto achieve consensus on related issues that conform \r\nto the needs and priorities of Afghanistan.As late as \r\nlast night we did our best to reach out to our Russian \r\ncolleagues. The main objective of the process was to \r\nmaintain the essence of last year’s resolution 72/10 \r\nwhile incorporating the many important developments \r\nthat have transpired over the past year in Afghanistan. \r\nThis year’s draft resolution reflects those \r\ndevelopments, while reaffirming the international \r\ncommunity’s continued support. The Russian \r\ndelegation expressed concern about three points. The \r\nfirst was the reference in the draft resolution to the \r\nMoscow format consultations, the second was about \r\nthe threat posed by Da’esh and similar terrorist groups, \r\nand the third was the reference to NATO’s continued \r\nsupport role in Afghanistan in helping to enhance the \r\ncapacity of the Afghan National Defence and Security \r\nForces through commitments made at the Brussels and \r\n06/12/2018 A/73/PV.46\r\n18-41573 21/23\r\nWarsaw conferences. I will touch briefly on each of \r\nthose three points.\r\nFirst, Afghanistan has been clear in welcoming all \r\nregional and international processes in support of our \r\nAfghan-owned and -led peace efforts. However, we \r\nhave taken the clear position that all such initiatives \r\nshould serve to reinforce the centrality of Afghan \r\nownership and leadership of our peace efforts aimed at \r\nbringing an end to the current conflict.\r\nThis year’s draft resolution includes a reference \r\nto the Moscow format consultations, based on agreed \r\nlanguage in the Geneva communiqué endorsed a \r\nlittle less than two weeks ago in the presence of all \r\ndelegations, including that of the Russian Federation. \r\nAlong with a large group of countries, we were therefore \r\nnot able to agree with language modifications on the \r\nMoscow format that deviated from the language agreed \r\non in Geneva. Moreover, while the Moscow meeting \r\nrepresented a development, it took place in a way that \r\ncontradicted the principle of transparency, since four of \r\nthe five Taliban members who travelled to Moscow did \r\nso without a travel-ban exemption from the Committee \r\npusuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and \r\n2253 (2015), concerning ISIL (Da’esh), Al-Qaida \r\nand associated individuals, groups, undertakings \r\nand entities.\r\nSecondly, the Afghan National Defence and Security \r\nForces are on the front line of the fight against various \r\nterrorist groups that have come from abroad, including \r\nDa’esh and its affiliates. The progress that our forces \r\nhave made in combating such groups, particularly \r\nDa’esh, has reached new levels, and those groups have \r\nsuffered heavy setbacks on the battlefield, resulting in \r\na substantially diminished presence in various parts of \r\nthe country, including the north. We therefore opted to \r\nretain agreed language from last year’s resolution that \r\nreflected the threat of Da’esh without exaggerating the \r\nreality of the situation on the ground.\r\nThirdly, Afghanistan is engaged with various \r\ninternational partners for security and stability, \r\nincluding NATO, which provides a significant portion \r\nof security support and training for the Afghan \r\nNational Defence and Security Forces. In that regard, \r\nvarious paragraphs of the draft resolution were \r\nstreamlined to produce a more focused text, including \r\nsome references to NATO, at the proposal of a number \r\nof delegations, including the Russian Federation. Any \r\nadditional changes would therefore not be acceptable \r\nto Afghanistan and our relevant international partners.\r\nThe representative of the Russian Federation \r\nreminded us of the Security Council’s visit to Kabul \r\nin January, about 11 months ago, where I was present \r\nwhen the Russian delegation, seated at a dining table \r\nwith our President, pledged to improve coordination \r\nand consensus among the members of the Security \r\nCouncil, with a focus on improving security and \r\ndevelopment in Afghanistan. We had been looking \r\nforward to seeing further cooperation with the Russian \r\nFederation reflected in the draft resolution.\r\nWe once again express our regret at the Russian \r\nFederation’s request for a vote, which suggests an \r\nintention to play a non-constructive role with respect to \r\nthe international community’s consensus and support \r\nfor Afghanistan. We therefore call on all Member States \r\nto vote in favour of the draft resolution, in keeping with \r\nthe long-standing support of the General Assembly and \r\nthe international community for a peaceful, stable and \r\nprosperous Afghanistan.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Germany on a point of order.\r\nMr. Licharz (Germany): Germany fully aligns \r\nitself with the statement on a point of order made by the \r\nrepresentative of Afghanistan, who very ably described \r\nthe process of preparing draft resolution A/73/L.44, \r\nwhich is before us today, and the substantive points \r\nthat were incorporated during that long and inclusive \r\nprocess. Without repeating his points, I want only \r\nto reiterate Germany’s regret about the Russian \r\nFederation’s request that the draft resolution be put to a \r\nvote. We call on all Member States not only to support \r\nthe draft resolution but in doing that to support the \r\nAfghan people and Government.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Russian Federation on a point \r\nof order.\r\nMr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I just briefly want to ascertain the point of \r\norder on which the delegations of Afghanistan and \r\nGermany have just spoken. The Russian delegation \r\nmade a statement explaining our vote before the \r\nvoting and requesting a decision on that vote. There \r\nwas no violation of the order of the meeting, which is \r\nwhy I assume that the delegations of Afghanistan and \r\nGermany were speaking in explanation of vote before \r\nA/73/PV.46 06/12/2018\r\n22/23 18-41573\r\nthe voting and not on a point of order. Would you please \r\nclarify that, Sir?\r\nThe Acting President: In response to the question \r\nfrom the delegation of the Russian Federation, I refer \r\nthe Assembly to rule 88 of its rules of procedure, which \r\nstates that the President shall not permit the proposer of \r\na proposal to explain his vote on his own proposal. The \r\ndelegations of Afghanistan and Germany utilized that \r\nrule in making their statements.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.44, entitled “The situation \r\nin Afghanistan”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the Russian \r\nFederation on a point of order.\r\nMr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): You, Sir, referred to rule 88 of the General \r\nAssembly’s rules of procedure, which states that after \r\nthe President has announced the beginning of voting, \r\nno representative shall interrupt the voting except \r\non a point of order. As I understand it, you had not \r\nannounced the beginning of the voting, and we made \r\nour statement explaining our vote before the voting \r\nand asking for draft resolution A/73/L.44 to be put to a \r\nvote. It is therefore incorrect to say that the delegations \r\nof Afghanistan and Germany were speaking on a \r\npoint of order in accordance with rule 88 of the rules \r\nof procedure. Those delegations were speaking in \r\nexplanation of vote before the voting, because the vote \r\nhad not yet been announced.\r\nThe Acting President: The statement of the \r\nRussian Federation is noted and will be included in the \r\nrecord of the meeting.\r\nThe Assembly will now proceed to take action \r\non draft resolution A/73/L.44, entitled “The situation \r\nin Afghanistan”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the submission of the draft resolution, and \r\nin addition to those delegations listed in document \r\nA/73/L.44, the following countries have become \r\nsponsors of the draft resolution: Albania, Andorra, \r\nAustria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, \r\nCroatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, \r\nGeorgia, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, \r\nIreland, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, \r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, \r\nMongolia, Montenegro, Nepal, New Zealand, Norway, \r\nPakistan, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, \r\nRomania, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, \r\nSwitzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and \r\nUnited Arab Emirates.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now take \r\na decision on draft resolution A/73/L.44. A recorded \r\nvote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, \r\nArgentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, \r\nBahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bhutan, \r\nBolivia (Plurinational State of), Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, \r\nCambodia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa \r\nRica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, \r\nDenmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, \r\nEquatorial Guinea, Estonia, Finland, France, \r\nGeorgia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, \r\nHonduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran \r\n(Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, \r\nJapan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic, Latvia, \r\nLebanon, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMalawi, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, \r\nMicronesia (Federated States of), Monaco, \r\nMongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, \r\nNamibia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, \r\nNicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, \r\nPalau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, \r\nPhilippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of \r\nKorea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Samoa, \r\nSan Marino, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, \r\nSlovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, \r\nSweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Tunisia, \r\nTurkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United \r\nArab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland, United States of America, \r\nUruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela (Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of), Viet Nam, Yemen\r\nAgainst:\r\nNone\r\n06/12/2018 A/73/PV.46\r\n18-41573 23/23\r\nAbstaining:\r\nLibya, Russian Federation, Zimbabwe\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.44 was adopted by 124 \r\nvotes to none, with 3 abstentions (resolution 73/88).\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor to \r\nspeakers in explanation of vote on the resolution just \r\nadopted, may I remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of China.\r\nMr. Lie Cheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nadoption of resolution 73/88, on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan, contributes to demonstrating the support \r\nof the international community for the people and the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan and will help to encourage \r\nthe National Unity Government to make continued \r\nefforts to promote socioeconomic development and \r\nnational reconciliation. It will also contribute to \r\nenhancing economic cooperation and interconnectivity \r\nin the region and helping Afghanistan to participate in \r\nthe regional economic integration process.\r\nChina is not fully satisfied with parts of the text \r\nof the resolution just adopted, which, on a number \r\nof important issues, failed to maintain the consensus \r\namong Member States that had been reached in the \r\npast. During consultations on the draft resolution, the \r\nimportant concerns of a number of Member States \r\nwere not accommodated and, as a result, a recorded \r\nvote was requested. China would like to express its \r\ndisappointment in that regard. Nevertheless, on the \r\nbasis of its support for the early achievement of peace, \r\nstability and development in Afghanistan, China voted \r\nin favour of the resolution.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 40?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.20 p.m.\r\n"
