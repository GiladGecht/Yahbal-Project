The Fourth Committee \r\nconsidered the report submitted by the Committee on \r\nInformation (A/73/21) and the related report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/73/288), and was briefed by the \r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Global Communications \r\nabout the efforts being made by the Department of \r\nPublic Information to promote the United Nations \r\nmessage around the world. The Fourth Committee \r\nadopted draft resolution A, entitled “Information \r\nin the service of humanity”, and draft resolution B, \r\nentitled “United Nations public information policies \r\nand activities”. Both draft resolutions are contained in \r\nparagraph 9 of the report.\r\nWith regard to the cluster of items on non-self-\r\ngoverning territories and the Declaration on the \r\nGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries \r\nand Peoples — agenda items 59 to 63 — the Fourth \r\nCommittee considered those five items together, \r\nholding a joint general debate on the cluster of items \r\nand hearing 114 petitioners on the various Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territories, as well as the President of French \r\nPolynesia, the President of the Government of New \r\nCaledonia and the Deputy Chief Minister of Gibraltar.\r\nUnder those items, the General Assembly has before \r\nit the following five reports: the report submitted under \r\nagenda item 59, entitled “Information from Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territories transmitted under Article 73 \r\ne of the Charter of the United Nations”, contained in \r\ndocument A/73/473; the report submitted under agenda \r\nitem 60, entitled “Economic and other activities which \r\naffect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territories”, contained in document A/73/474; \r\nthe report submitted under agenda item 61, entitled \r\n“Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of \r\nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the \r\nspecialized agencies and the international institutions \r\nassociated with the United Nations”, contained in \r\ndocument A/73/475; the report submitted under agenda \r\nitem 62, entitled “Offers by Member States of study \r\n07/12/2018 A/73/PV.48\r\n18-41777 3/18\r\nand training facilities for inhabitants of Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territories”, contained in document \r\nA/73/476; and the report submitted under agenda item \r\n63, entitled “Implementation of the Declaration on the \r\nGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries and \r\nPeoples”, contained in document A/73/532.

The Fourth \r\nCommittee recommends the draft decision to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for adoption.\r\nThe need did not arise for the Committee to take \r\nup item 137, “Programme planning”, at this stage, as \r\nindicated in the report of the Committee contained in \r\ndocument A/73/534.\r\nI have the honour to submit to the General Assembly \r\nfor its consideration and adoption the draft resolutions \r\nand draft decisions recommended by the Special \r\nPolitical and Decolonization Committee (Fourth \r\nCommittee) in its reports contained in documents \r\nA/73/470 to A/73/476, A/73/521, A/73/523 to A/73/526 \r\nand A/73/532 to A/73/534.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to recall the high \r\nlevel of cooperation that prevails in the Special Political \r\nand Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee). \r\nThe Committee was able to fulfil the mandate \r\nentrusted to it by the Assembly and to effectively \r\nand constructively complete its work within the time \r\nallotted by the Assembly. I should like to express, on \r\nbehalf of the Bureau of the Committee, our sincere \r\nappreciation to all delegations for their constructive \r\nparticipation during this session.\r\nI should like to pay particular tribute to the Chair of \r\nthe Fourth Committee, His Excellency Mr. Dee-Maxwell \r\nSaah Kemayah, Sr., of Liberia, whose knowledge and \r\nexperience, enhanced by his consummate diplomatic \r\nskills, enabled the Committee to consider in depth all \r\nthe agenda items allocated to it. The other members \r\nof the Bureau, my personal friends Mr. Faisal Nasser \r\nAlhakbani of Saudi Arabia, Mr. Daniel Goldea of \r\nHungary and Mr. Michael O’Toole of Ireland, with \r\nwhom I had the pleasure of working, also contributed \r\ngreatly to the successful conclusion of the work of \r\nthe Committee.\r\nI should also like to place on record our appreciation \r\nfor the able and effective assistance provided by the \r\nDepartment of Political Affairs and the Disarmament \r\nand Peace Affairs Branch of the Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management, which  served \r\nas the secretariat of the Committee.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the \r\nRapporteur of the Special Political and Decolonization \r\nCommittee (Fourth Committee).\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the \r\nrecommendations of the Committee have been made \r\nclear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant \r\nofficial records. Therefore, if there is no proposal under \r\nrule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly decides not to discuss the reports \r\nof the Special Political and Decolonization Committee \r\n(Fourth Committee) that are before the Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Before \r\nproceeding, I wish to consult delegations on how \r\nI intend to proceed to refer to the reports of the \r\nCommittee. In order to save time, I will use only the \r\nterm “the Committee”, on the understanding that the \r\nformal name of the Committee, the Special Political \r\nand Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee), \r\nwill be reflected in the official records.\r\nIf I hear no objection, we shall proceed accordingly.\r\nMay I remind delegations that, in accordance \r\nwith paragraph 7 of decision 34/401, the General \r\nAssembly agreed that when the same draft resolution \r\nis considered in a Main Committee and in plenary \r\nmeeting, a delegation should, as far as possible, explain \r\nits vote only once, that is, either in the Committee or in \r\nplenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote in plenary \r\nmeeting is different from its vote in the Committee.\r\nMay I further remind delegations that, also in \r\naccordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise delegations that \r\nwe are going to take decisions in the same manner as \r\nA/73/PV.48 07/12/2018\r\n4/18 18-41777\r\nwas done in the Committee, unless the Secretariat is \r\nnotified to the contrary in advance. That means that, \r\nwhere recorded votes were taken, we will do the same. \r\nI also hope that we will proceed to adopt without a vote \r\nthose recommendations that were adopted without a \r\nvote in the Committee. The results of the votes will be \r\nuploaded on the PaperSmart portal.\r\nBefore proceeding further, I would like to draw \r\nthe attention of delegations to a note by the Secretariat \r\nentitled “Checklist of reports of the Special Political \r\nand Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) \r\nto the General Assembly on agenda items 51 to 63, \r\n123 and 137”, which has been circulated, in English \r\nonly, as document A/C.4/73/INF/3. The note has been \r\ndistributed desk to desk in the General Assembly Hall \r\nas a reference guide for action on the draft resolutions \r\nand decisions recommended by the Committee in \r\nits reports.\r\nIn that connection, delegations will find in column \r\n4 of the note the numbers of the draft resolutions or \r\ndecisions of the Committee, with the corresponding \r\nsymbols of the reports for action in the plenary in \r\ncolumn 2 of the same note. For reports containing \r\nmultiple recommendations, the number of the draft \r\nresolution or decision is contained in column 3 of \r\nthe note.\r\nDelegations are reminded that additional sponsors \r\nare no longer accepted once draft resolutions and \r\ndecisions have been adopted by the Committee. Any \r\nclarification about sponsorship should be addressed \r\nto the secretariat of the Committee. I would also like \r\nto remind delegations that any corrections to their \r\nvoting intentions after the voting has concluded should \r\nbe made directly to the Secretariat. I would seek the \r\ncooperation of delegations in avoiding any interruptions \r\nto the proceedings in that regard.\r\nAgenda item 51\r\nUniversity for Peace\r\nReport of the Special Political and \r\nDecolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) \r\n(A/73/470)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nhas before it a draft resolution recommended by the \r\nCommittee in paragraph 8 of its report.

The \r\nCommittee adopted it without a vote. May I take it that \r\nthe Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted (decision 73/519).\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nthe representative of Cuba, who wishes to speak in \r\nexplanation of position on resolution 73/113.\r\nMs. Rodríguez Abascal (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): With regard to resolution 73/113, entitled \r\n“Question of Guam”, the delegation of Cuba joined the \r\nconsensus because the resolution summarizes the work \r\nof the Special Political and Decolonization Committee \r\n(Fourth Committee) — of which it is a member and \r\nVice-Chair — on the non-autonomous territory of \r\nGuam, which still does not have the right of self-\r\ndetermination to decide whether it wishes to continue \r\nto be subordinated to the administering Power, the \r\nUnited States, or whether it prefers to break with its \r\ncolonial ties and be an independent, sovereign country.\r\nNevertheless, we wish to place on record the fact \r\nthat the delegation of Cuba dissociates itself from the \r\ncontents of the eighteenth and twenty-seventh preambular \r\nparagraphs. As adopted, the resolution — which reflects \r\nA/73/PV.48 07/12/2018\r\n18/18 18-41777\r\nthe amendments incorporated at the time of its adoption \r\nby the Fourth Committee — does not take into account \r\nthe serious concerns expressed in United Nations \r\ndecolonization forums by the representatives of Guam \r\nwith regard to the ruling by a United States federal \r\ncourt on the non-acceptance by that country’s legal \r\nbodies of regulations recognizing the exclusivity of the \r\nnative inhabitants of Guam and any American citizens \r\nliving there with respect to their equal right to vote in \r\na referendum. The ruling put a stop to the plebiscite.\r\nSimilarly, the amendment made to the other \r\nparagraph completely removed the clear reference \r\nto the fact that the Chamorro Land Trust programme \r\nwas put in place to facilitate the transfer of land to the \r\noriginal owners.\r\nUsing the forum of the General Assembly while \r\ntotally circumventing the decolonization forums and \r\nconsequently disregarding the lack of a negotiating \r\nprocess between the two parties — representatives \r\nof the territory of Guam and the administering \r\nPower — is a regrettable attempt to f lout the principle \r\nof multilateralism, which all the Members of the \r\nOrganization must adhere to and defend.\r\nFor those reasons, we reiterate that the Cuban \r\ndelegation dissociates itself from the eighteenth and \r\ntwenty-seventh preambular paragraphs.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 63?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 123 (continued)\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nReport of the Special Political and \r\nDecolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) \r\n(A/73/533)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before \r\nit a draft decision recommended by the Committee in \r\nparagraph 6 of its report.\r\nWe will now take action on the draft decision, \r\nentitled “Proposed programme of work and timetable \r\nof the Special Political and Decolonization Committee \r\n(Fourth Committee) for the seventy-fourth session of \r\nthe General Assembly”. The Committee adopted it \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted (decision 73/520).\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 123.\r\nAgenda item 137 (continued)\r\nProgramme planning\r\nReport of the Special Political and \r\nDecolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) \r\n(A/73/534)\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly wishes to take note of the report of \r\nthe Committee?\r\nIt was so decided (decision 73/521).\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 137.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I would like to \r\nthank Mr. Dee-Maxwell Saah Kemayah, Sr., Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Liberia to the United Nations and \r\nChair of the Special Political and Decolonization \r\nCommittee (Fourth Committee), the members of the \r\nBureau and representatives for a job well done.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded its \r\nconsideration of all of the reports of the Special Political \r\nand Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) \r\nbefore it at this meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.15 a.m.\r\n"
