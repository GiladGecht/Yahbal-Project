This year Singapore \r\nhad the great honour of coordinating the informal \r\nconsultations on draft resolution A/73/L.35. The actual \r\ncoordination was done by my colleague Ms. Natalie \r\nMorris-Sharma, Director of the International Legal \r\nDivision of the Ministry of Law of Singapore. Due to \r\nher work commitments, Ms. Morris-Sharma was unable \r\nto join us today and has asked me to convey her regrets \r\nto the Assembly. She would also like to express her deep \r\nappreciation for the support given by all delegations to \r\nensure an acceptable outcome for everyone. I would \r\nlike to begin by introducing the draft resolution on \r\nher behalf.\r\nThe draft resolution before us remains one of the \r\nmost comprehensive and important of the resolutions \r\non oceans and the law of the sea adopted annually by \r\nthe General Assembly. For that reason, it has come to \r\nbe known as the oceans omnibus resolution. It covers a \r\nwide spectrum of activities and a broad range of issues, \r\nincluding those concerning the implementation of the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and \r\nrelated agreements and instruments; capacity-building; \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes; the work of the \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

As always, negotiations were intense and \r\ncovered a wide range of issues. In the interests of time, \r\nI will not attempt to cover all the issues raised. I will, \r\nhowever, highlight six points as examples of issues that \r\nemerged from this year’s negotiations.\r\nFirst, the draft resolution takes stock of the \r\nactivities of the International Seabed Authority. Among \r\nother things, it welcomes the progress of the work of \r\nthe Authority on draft regulations for the exploitation \r\nof mineral resources in the Area and emphasizes the \r\nongoing need for openness and transparency. It also \r\nwelcomes the decision to adopt the International \r\nSeabed Authority’s Strategic Plan for the period from \r\n2019 to 2023 (ISBA/24/A/4), as well as the efforts of \r\nthe Authority to make progress on the development of \r\nregional environmental management plans, in particular \r\nwhere there are currently exploration contracts.\r\nSecondly, the draft resolution recognizes the needs \r\nof developing States in the context of making submissions \r\nto the Commission on the Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf. In that connection, the draft resolution amends \r\nthe terms of reference, guidelines and rules of the Trust \r\nFund for the purpose of facilitating the preparation of \r\nsubmissions to the Commission. The draft resolution \r\nalso decides that the members of the Commission \r\nhave the option of joining the Headquarters medical \r\ninsurance scheme on payment of the full cost of the \r\npremium. That would be on an exceptional basis and \r\nwithout setting a precedent for other agenda items.\r\nThirdly, the draft resolution underscores \r\nthe importance of the work undertaken by the \r\nIntergovernmental Conference to elaborate the text of \r\nan international legally binding instrument under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. In that \r\nregard, the draft resolution welcomes the holding of \r\nthe organizational meeting and the first session of the \r\nIntergovernmental Conference. It also requests the \r\nSecretary-General to convene the second and third \r\nsessions of the Intergovernmental Conference in 2019.\r\nFourthly, the draft resolution notes the \r\ndiscussions at the nineteenth meeting of the Informal \r\nConsultative Process on the theme of anthropogenic \r\nunderwater noise, and calls on States to consider \r\nappropriate cost-effective measures and approaches \r\nto assess and address the potential socioeconomic and \r\nenvironmental impact of anthropogenic underwater \r\nnoise. Such consideration would take into account the \r\nprecautionary and ecosystem approaches and the best \r\navailable scientific information, as appropriate. The \r\ndraft resolution goes on to decide that the next meeting \r\nwill focus its discussions on the theme of ocean science \r\nand the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nFifthly, with regard to the Regular Process, the \r\ndraft resolution welcomes the meetings and endorses \r\nthe recommendations of the Ad Hoc Working Group of \r\nthe Whole on the Regular Process for Global Reporting \r\nand Assessment of the State of the Marine Environment, \r\nincluding Socioeconomic Aspects. Among other things, \r\nit notes the Ad Hoc Working Group’s approval of the \r\noutline for the second World Ocean Assessment and its \r\npreliminary timetable and implementation plan.\r\nSixthly, action was taken this year to address the \r\ngrowing length and improve the readability of the draft \r\nresolution. The existing resolution, resolution 72/73, \r\nstands at 56 preambular and 370 operative paragraphs. \r\nIt has been said that this undermines its readability and \r\neffectiveness. Delegations have discussed this for some \r\ntime, and this year we finally took steps to address the \r\nissue, resulting in the retirement of language that is \r\noutdated or duplicative. Part IX of the draft resolution \r\nwas also reordered to improve coherence. Delegations \r\nintend to continue these efforts to streamline the draft \r\nresolution next year.\r\nI want to convey our deep appreciation to the \r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for \r\nits outstanding support throughout the process. I would \r\nalso like to express sincere thanks to all the delegations \r\nthat participated so actively and constructively during \r\nthe negotiations. While a number of issues were \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 3/32\r\nparticularly challenging, delegations were eventually \r\nable to achieve consensus on every proposal and \r\nparagraph. It therefore gives me great pleasure to submit \r\nthe draft resolution to the Assembly for its adoption. \r\nIt is my hope that the same spirit of cooperation and \r\nunderstanding that characterized the negotiations will \r\nbe demonstrated by delegations today and that the draft \r\nresolution will be adopted by consensus.\r\nI would now like to speak briefly in my national \r\ncapacity to make three points. First, I want to emphasize \r\nhow critically important a rules-based international \r\norder is for our oceans and seas. That has become \r\never more significant at a time when multilateralism \r\nis increasingly under siege. We need more mutual \r\nunderstanding, cooperation and respect for international \r\nlaw, not less. In that regard, we reaffirm the central \r\nrole of the Convention on the Law of the Sea, which \r\nsets out the legal framework within which all activities \r\nin the oceans and seas must be carried out. We also \r\nunderscore the importance of the work undertaken by \r\nthe ISA to develop the draft regulations on exploitation \r\nand by the Intergovernmental Conference on marine \r\nbiological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction \r\nto elaborate the text of an international legally binding \r\ninstrument under the Convention. The development \r\nof those instruments clarifies and adds to the body of \r\nlaw and the regulations that are fundamental to ocean \r\ngovernance. We therefore look forward to working \r\nclosely with other delegations at the upcoming sessions \r\nof the ISA and the Intergovernmental Conference.\r\nThat brings me to my second point, which is \r\nthe importance of building the capacity of States \r\non oceans and the law of the sea. It is not enough to \r\nhave good instruments, institutions and processes at \r\nthe international level. We also need to ensure that \r\ncountries have the necessary human resources and \r\ncapability to implement those instruments and engage \r\nin the work of the relevant institutions and processes. \r\nAs a small island State with no natural resources, \r\nSingapore believes that the development of human \r\nresources is key to a country’s sustainable development \r\nand progress. In 1992 we therefore established the \r\nSingapore Cooperation Programme, our primary \r\nplatform for assisting fellow developing countries \r\nand enhancing South-South cooperation. In July of \r\nthis year, we organized a course entitled “Sustainable \r\nmarine resources: enhancing biodiversity in coastal \r\nwaterways”, which introduced various approaches to \r\nmanaging and enhancing marine biodiversity in coastal \r\nwaterways. In January of next year we will organize a \r\ncourse on the international law of the sea that will focus \r\non the Convention, cover issues of maritime boundary \r\ndelimitation and examine the role of the relevant \r\ninternational organizations.\r\nMy third and final point relates to the ongoing \r\nimplementation of Sustainable Development Goal \r\n14. Last year the United Nations held the Ocean \r\nConference, which has garnered more than 1,400 \r\nvoluntary commitments to date. Despite its success, \r\nwe cannot afford to rest on our laurels but must rather \r\ncontinue to sustain the momentum that has been \r\ngenerated, respond to the call for action by the Ocean \r\nConference and by the Assembly and implement our \r\nrespective voluntary commitments.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to say that we cannot \r\noverstate the importance of our oceans and seas. They \r\nprovide livelihoods for millions of people, enable food \r\nsecurity and maritime trade, regulate the climate and \r\nare an important source of renewable energy. As a \r\nsmall island State that depends on the oceans and seas \r\nfor its survival, Singapore is deeply committed to the \r\nlaw of the sea and strongly believes that a multilateral \r\nrules-based system is key to securing the sustainability \r\nof our oceans, seas and their resources for future \r\ngenerations. I would therefore like to end by stressing \r\nthe importance of respecting the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level and adhering to the principles, rights \r\nand duties outlined in the Convention.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Norway to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.41.\r\nMs. Skåre (Norway): Norway had the honour \r\nof coordinating the informal consultations on draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.41, on sustainable fisheries. Today \r\nI am pleased to introduce that text on behalf of all \r\nits sponsors. On behalf of the coordinator, Andreas \r\nKravik, and Norway, I would like to thank Director \r\nGabriele Goettsche-Wanli and the staff of the Division \r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for their \r\nexpertise, professionalism and invaluable support \r\nbefore and during the consultations. This year’s draft \r\nresolution is a further step forward in the conservation \r\nand management of fish stocks, which are an essential \r\nresource for sustainable development in much of the \r\nworld and for our common future.\r\nSustainable food from aquatic ecosystems is \r\nplaying an increasingly critical role in global food \r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n4/32 18-42609\r\nand nutrition security. Fisheries are immensely \r\nimportant to employment, trade and economic well-\r\nbeing throughout the world. The draft resolution \r\nbefore us addresses vital issues such as securing \r\nsustainable small-scale fisheries, combating illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing, addressing fishing \r\novercapacity, further improving subregional and \r\nregional cooperation to achieve sustainable fisheries \r\nmanagement and promoting the use of scientific advice \r\nin developing, adopting and implementing conservation \r\nand management measures. It also addresses relevant \r\nissues dealt with in other United Nations forums. \r\nThey include environmental concerns such as marine \r\npollution and marine litter — particularly plastics \r\nand microplastics — anthropogenic underwater noise \r\nand the impact of global climate change. Another \r\nimportant issue that it addresses is the need to ensure \r\ndecent working conditions in fisheries and other \r\nmaritime sectors.\r\nI would now like to speak in my national capacity. \r\nNorway is pleased to join many others in sponsoring \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.35, entitled “Oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea”, as introduced by Ambassador Gafoor of \r\nSingapore. We thank Singapore and Ms. Morris-Sharma \r\nfor her careful stewardship and effective leadership \r\nduring the two rounds of consultations. The draft \r\nresolution addresses important issues related to the \r\nimplementation of the law of the sea. We fully support \r\nit and the parameters it outlines for ocean activities. Its \r\npreamble reaffirms that the United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea sets out the legal framework \r\nwithin which all activities in the oceans and seas must \r\nbe carried out, and Norway fully supports that view. \r\nThe Convention provides clarity with regard to both the \r\nobligations and the rights of States. That framework \r\nis indispensable for the sustainable use of marine \r\nresources, the protection of the marine environment, \r\nthe safety and security of shipping, international and \r\nregional cooperation and marine scientific research.\r\nThe oceans have huge potential when it comes to \r\nmeeting the world’s needs for resources, creating jobs \r\nand fostering economic and social development. But \r\nwe will not be able to realize that potential without \r\nsustainable growth in ocean-based industries. This \r\nyear, Norway’s Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, together \r\nwith Heads of State and Government of coastal States \r\naround the world, established the High-level Panel for \r\na Sustainable Ocean Economy. The Panel will harness \r\nleading scientific expertise from around the globe and \r\nconsider evidence-based proposals for dealing with the \r\nglobal ocean crisis, including on sustainable fisheries, \r\nocean-based energy solutions, tourism, new approaches \r\nto marine protected areas, and the ocean economy. \r\nThe Panel is committed to catalysing bold, pragmatic \r\nsolutions for ocean health and wealth that support the \r\nSustainable Development Goals and build a better \r\nfuture for the planet and its people.\r\nThe obligation to protect and preserve the marine \r\nenvironment is clearly set out in the Convention, and \r\nStates are required to take measures needed to prevent, \r\nreduce and control pollution of the marine environment. \r\nMarine litter is one of the biggest environmental \r\nproblems of our time. Around 8 million tons of plastics \r\nend up in the oceans every year. Most of that litter comes \r\nfrom land-based sources, because many countries have \r\ninadequate waste-management systems. It is therefore \r\nvital to improve waste management in developing \r\ncountries, increase awareness of the issue of marine \r\nlitter and facilitate effective clean-up programmes. \r\nNorway is playing a leading role in global efforts to \r\npromote clean and healthy oceans. The development \r\nprogramme to combat marine litter is a key element \r\nof my Government’s ocean efforts and Norway has \r\nsubstantially increased funding aimed at dealing \r\nwith the problem. Norway has worked to ensure that \r\nthe prevention of marine pollution, including marine \r\nplastic litter, is a key theme for the PROBLUE trust \r\nfund recently established by the World Bank. Norway \r\nprovided 125 million kroner to the fund this year.\r\nPromoting and facilitating marine scientific \r\nresearch is an essential element of the Convention and \r\nvital to achieving the sustainable use and conservation \r\nof the oceans. Norway strongly supports the decision \r\nto focus next year’s discussion in the Informal \r\nConsultative Process on the theme of ocean science \r\nand the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nNorway is a steadfast supporter of the process of \r\ndeveloping a new instrument for the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of biodiversity in areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction. We are fully aware of the challenges that \r\nlie ahead, as the Intergovernmental Conference on \r\nan international legally binding instrument under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction will \r\nhave to resolve highly complex and sensitive issues. \r\nHowever, we remain hopeful that we will be able to \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 5/32\r\nreach an agreed outcome through constructive and \r\nf lexible negotiations among States under the effective \r\nand f lexible leadership of Rena Lee of Singapore.\r\nI would like to conclude by expressing Norway’s \r\nappreciation for the hard work and cooperation of all \r\nthe delegations involved in the informal consultations \r\non these two draft resolutions. We hope that this \r\nconstructive approach can be maintained as we continue \r\nto tackle the many complex issues relating to oceans \r\nand fisheries.\r\nMrs. Mills (Jamaica): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the 14 member countries of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM) on sub-items (a) and (b) of \r\nagenda item 78, on oceans and the law of the sea.\r\nCARICOM welcomes the opportunity to participate \r\nin today’s debate, as the issues under consideration are \r\nof seminal importance to its members as small island \r\ndeveloping States whose fortunes are integrally linked \r\nto the ocean. We therefore thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor the various reports that have been prepared to guide \r\nour deliberations as we take stock of what we have \r\nbeen able to achieve since we last met to discuss these \r\nissues during the seventy-second session of the General \r\nAssembly (see A/72/PV.63 et seq.).\r\nIt is obvious that our efforts as an international \r\ncommunity to confront the challenges that plague our \r\nmarine resources have yielded mixed results. We can \r\nbe proud of the fact that awareness about the risks \r\nconfronting our oceans and seas has increased and that \r\nit has been underpinned by a greater sense of urgency \r\nregarding immediate and concrete action to effect \r\nmeaningful change. The situation is made patently \r\nclear in the Secretary-General’s report contained in \r\ndocument A/73/368, notably paragraphs 3 and 4, which \r\ndescribe the state of the oceans as being perilous and a \r\nglobal emergency. Equally unnerving are the findings \r\nof a recent study, to which the report also refers, \r\nthat Goal 14 ranks last in significance among all the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out in the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. CARICOM \r\ntherefore looks forward to the outcome of ongoing \r\nefforts to develop the methodology for indicators for \r\nSDG 14, with the expectation that that could improve \r\nprospects for increasing awareness about the Goal.\r\nThe two draft resolutions to be adopted today — the \r\nomnibus draft resolution on oceans and law of the sea \r\n(A/73/L.35) and the draft resolution on sustainable \r\nfisheries (A/73/L.41) — are the results of long and \r\nintense negotiations, with delegations showing \r\nf lexibility and a desire to advance the objectives of \r\nthe draft resolutions. We wish to thank the respective \r\nco-facilitators, Ms. Natalie Morris-Sharma of \r\nSingapore and Mr. Andreas Kravik of Norway, under \r\nwhose able guidance and leadership we were able to \r\nsuccessfully conclude our consultations. Together, \r\nthose draft resolutions provide important steps \r\ntowards strengthening the implementation of existing \r\ninstruments on oceans at the global and regional levels. \r\nConsequently, CARICOM will lend its traditional \r\nsupport to both texts.\r\nThe convening in September of the first session of \r\nthe Intergovernmental Conference on the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biodiversity of areas \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction was a milestone in \r\nthe efforts to fill the legal gap with respect to the \r\nprotection and use of the resources of the high seas. \r\nCARICOM would like to congratulate the President of \r\nthe Conference, Ambassador Rena Lee of Singapore, \r\non the efficient manner in which she presided over our \r\nwork, and looks forward to the remaining sessions to he \r\nheld over the next two years. CARICOM stands ready to \r\nplay its part in achieving a successful outcome in 2020.\r\nCARICOM also fully supports the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup of the Whole on the Regular Process for Global \r\nReporting and Assessment of the State of the Marine \r\nEnvironment, including Socioeconomic Aspects, which \r\nis so ably co-chaired by our expert colleagues from \r\nBarbados and Estonia. As work for the preparation of \r\nthe second World Ocean Assessment report intensifies, \r\nthe members of the Assembly can rest assured that \r\nCARICOM will continue to be engaged in the process.\r\nCARICOM countries have been playing their part \r\nin supporting the adoption of plans, programmes and \r\npolicies aimed at ensuring the health and preservation \r\nof our oceans and seas. While currently protecting \r\nmore than 10 per cent of its coastal marine territory, the \r\nBahamas has launched its next 10 per cent of designated \r\nmarine protected areas, as part of its commitment \r\nto reach its goal of having 20 per cent of its waters \r\nprotected by 2020.\r\nAs we noted last year, several CARICOM countries \r\nhave put in place measures to ban the use of single-use \r\nplastics: Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, Saint Lucia and Grenada. Jamaica \r\nrecently announced that it will impose a similar ban in \r\nJanuary 2019, to be complemented by a ban, effective \r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n6/32 18-42609\r\nfor the same period, on the importation of expanded \r\npolystyrene foam, as well as on the importation and \r\nmanufacture of plastic drinking straws. Barbados has \r\nalso announced that it will ban single-use plastics and \r\nstyrofoam beginning 1 April 2019. In April 2018, the \r\nBahamas also signed a memorandum of understanding \r\non banning single-use plastics and styrofoam containers \r\nby 2020.\r\nCARICOM countries have also become parties to \r\nseveral instruments over the past year. In February, \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis acceded to the Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory \r\nFish Stocks. Grenada also signed the International \r\nConvention for the Control and Management of Ships’ \r\nBallast Water and Sediments in July.\r\nDespite our increasing knowledge of what \r\nlies beneath our oceans and seas, our real level of \r\nunderstanding of the state and nature of the ocean \r\nenvironment, including the resources of the ocean f loor, \r\nis still limited. For that reason, CARICOM welcomes \r\nthe designation of the United Nations Decade of Ocean \r\nScience for Sustainable Development for 2021-2030 \r\nand looks forward to the work that will inform the \r\nvarious activities and programmes undertaken over \r\nthe period. It is our hope that in addition to improving \r\nour knowledge of the ocean, it will inspire the kind of \r\nscience, technological innovations and policy interface \r\nneeded to ensure that meaningful action is taken in \r\nsupport of the ocean.\r\nWe look forward, in that regard, to the twentieth \r\nmeeting of the United Nations Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the \r\nSea next year, which will have as its theme the United \r\nNations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. We believe that will be an important \r\ncomplement to the work done by the nineteenth \r\nsession of the United Nations Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the \r\nSea in June on anthropogenic underwater noise, under \r\nthe stewardship of the Permanent Representatives of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago and Cyprus.\r\nThe impacts of climate change and the acidification \r\nof oceans and seas remain central to our ongoing \r\ndeliberations. We have witnessed a worsening and \r\ndeepening trend where action to combat climate change \r\nand ocean acidification has not kept pace with what is \r\nreally required to reverse current trends. Nowhere is \r\nthat more evident than in the provision of resources for \r\nclimate financing. CARICOM is therefore pleased that \r\nthe Secretary-General has sought to confront the issue \r\nwith the recent appointment of the Prime Minister of \r\nJamaica and the President of France as champions of \r\nclimate financing, to maximize opportunities for the \r\nunpacking of much-needed funds. We believe that will \r\nbe an important way to draw attention to the issue, \r\nwhile also preparing for the Secretary-General’s special \r\nclimate summit in 2019.\r\nCARICOM welcomes the fact that the International \r\nLaw Commission has agreed to include the issue of sea-\r\nlevel rise in its long-term programme of work. There \r\nare several important legal questions of relevance to \r\nCARICOM States, such as the legal implication of \r\nsea-level rise on baselines, which in turn influences \r\nthe limits of maritime zones and boundaries extending \r\nfrom those baselines. The decision to consider sea-level \r\nrise is both timely and relevant, and could not have been \r\nmore opportune. We reaffirm our call made in the Sixth \r\nCommittee for the topic to be moved to the active work \r\nprogramme of the Commission and look forward to the \r\nfuture work of the Commission in that regard.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea (UNCLOS) remains the centrepiece of the legal \r\nframework within which all activities in the oceans \r\nand seas must be carried out. The universal and unified \r\ncharacter of the Convention underscores its strategic \r\nimportance as the basis for national, regional and \r\nglobal action and cooperation in the marine sector. \r\nAs the constitution of the ocean, UNCLOS remains \r\ncentral to the sustainable management and use of \r\nmarine resources.\r\nThe work of the International Seabed Authority, \r\nthe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and \r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \r\nremain indispensable for the effective implementation \r\nof UNCLOS. We therefore welcome the positive \r\nreports of the work of all three bodies in fulfilling their \r\nrespective mandates.\r\nWe are especially pleased to note the progress \r\nmade on the review of article 154 and the Authority’s \r\ndevelopment of its Strategic Plan. We also welcome the \r\nefforts to ensure consistency and a linkage with the \r\nSDGs, as well as to put in place robust environmental \r\nregulations and management plans. We believe that \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 7/32\r\naugurs well for the Authority’s leadership role in that \r\nregard, especially in the context of the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction.\r\nAlso noteworthy is the fact that the recently \r\nconcluded twenty-fourth session of the Authority was \r\nsubject to a revised schedule of meetings, which saw \r\nrecord attendance at both its Council and Assembly \r\nsessions, in which 77 countries, 75 of them member \r\nStates and two observers, presented credentials for the \r\nAssembly session, while 60 countries, of which 32 are \r\nCouncil and 28 non-Council members, presented for \r\nthe Council.\r\nThe work of the United Nations Division for Ocean \r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea (DOALOS) cannot be \r\noveremphasized. CARICOM applauds the Division \r\nfor its professionalism and dedication in fulfilling its \r\nduties despite its limited resources, and joins the call \r\nfor the provision of the resources it needs to enable it to \r\ncontinue to execute its functions.\r\nThe work of the United Nations University, \r\nparticularly the Fisheries Training Programme in \r\nIceland and the International Ocean Institute, in \r\ncapacity-building and facilitating knowledge and \r\ntechnology transfer in ocean governance and the use \r\nof marine resources, s be recognized and commended.\r\nOur efforts to halt the challenges that confront \r\nour marine environment will not reap success if we \r\ndo not seize the opportunities to work together to \r\nimprove coordination and cooperation. For example, \r\nillegal fishing poses a great challenge, with the limited \r\ncapacity of small States to properly police their waters, \r\nthereby requiring greater cooperation and compliance. \r\nThere is scope for that and other issues to be addressed, \r\ngiven the many initiatives being pursued at the national, \r\nregional and multilateral levels.\r\nWe recognize, for example, the recently concluded \r\nSustainable Blue Economy Conference, held in Nairobi \r\nand co-hosted by the Governments of Canada and \r\nJapan; the High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean \r\nEconomy, co-chaired by the Prime Ministers of \r\nNorway and Palau, in which several other Heads of \r\nGovernment, including Jamaica, are also involved; and \r\nthe 2020 Ocean Conference being jointly organized by \r\nthe Governments of Portugal and Kenya.\r\nAs small island developing States, the members \r\nof CARICOM have an intimate relationship with the \r\nmarine environment, on which we are deeply reliant \r\nfor our economic survival. We have therefore read with \r\ngreat interest the observations made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in chapter VI of his previously referenced report \r\non balancing economic growth with environmental \r\nprotection. We support the importance of considering \r\nboth issues along a broader continuum that also seeks \r\nto strengthen regional and international cooperation \r\nand coordination, including through integrated and \r\ncross-sectoral approaches. That augurs well for the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine resources, \r\nwhile simultaneously addressing the various pressures \r\non the marine environment.\r\nCooperation and coordination should also extend \r\nto the United Nations system’s activities related to \r\nthe ocean. Capacity-building and the creation of \r\npartnerships will without any doubt remain critical. To \r\nthat end, we want to thank our bilateral partners and \r\nthe United Nations system for the support provided \r\nto date and look forward to the strengthening of \r\nthose relationships in the coming years. For example, \r\nas noted in the Secretary-General’s report, in 2018 \r\nCARICOM nationals from Guyana, Saint Lucia, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago were awarded fellowships under \r\nthe United Nations-Nippon Foundation Fellowship \r\nProgramme. Similarly, Barbados and Belize were \r\namong the countries benefiting from a project jointly \r\nundertaken by the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development and DOALOS to develop \r\nevidence-based and policy-coherent ocean economy \r\nand trade strategies.\r\nParticipation in discussions on the oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea is key to finding solutions. The \r\nvoluntary trust funds that exist as part of the United \r\nNations support system to advance that objective play \r\nan indispensable role in that. We therefore express \r\nour appreciation for the contributions that have been \r\nmade, but remain concerned about the sustainability \r\nand predictability of funding. We urge for continued \r\nsupport to that end. We would also like to acknowledge \r\nthe work done by the Special Envoy for the Oceans, \r\nMr. Peter Thomson, who has been using his portfolio \r\nto build greater awareness and advocacy in support of \r\nthe voluntary commitments made at the 2017 Ocean \r\nConference. The launch of the Communities of Ocean \r\nAction to implement the voluntary commitments, \r\ngenerate new commitments and facilitate collaboration \r\nand networking in support of SDG 14 is welcome.\r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n8/32 18-42609\r\nCARICOM is at the forefront of regional efforts \r\nto develop and implement fisheries management \r\nplans, establish and strengthen partnerships among \r\nkey stakeholders within the ocean sector and combat \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and \r\noverfishing, which pose a threat to the sustainability of \r\nlocal and regional fisheries. We will therefore continue \r\nto implement our common fisheries policy and ensure \r\nregular engagement through regional workshops, \r\npublic education campaigns and multi-stakeholder \r\nconsultations coordinated by the Caribbean Regional \r\nFisheries Mechanism, in partnership with organizations \r\nwithin and outside the region. We acknowledge \r\nthe important work being done by the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations to \r\nsupport sustainable fisheries in the CARICOM region \r\nand globally.\r\nThere is no denying that urgent action must be \r\ntaken. The conservation and sustainable use of the \r\noceans, seas and their resources is critical to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We must act now, and decisively.\r\nMr. Tealei (Tuvalu): I have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the 12 members of the Pacific small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS), the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, \r\nPalau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, \r\nTonga, Vanuatu and my own country, Tuvalu.\r\nAt the outset, the Pacific SIDS would like to \r\nthank Ms. Natalie Morris-Sharma of Singapore and \r\nMr. Andreas Kravik of Norway for bringing the \r\nnegotiations on the oceans omnibus draft resolution \r\n(A/73/L.35) and the sustainable fisheries draft \r\nresolution (A/73/L.41) to a successful conclusion.\r\nWe attach particular importance to this agenda item. \r\nAs we have often said, we consider the ocean the lifeblood \r\nof our economies and societies. We are therefore keenly \r\nattuned to the mounting negative effects on its health \r\ndriven by human activity. Overfishing and illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing, marine pollution, \r\nincluding from microplastics, the destruction of marine \r\nhabitats and other threats to marine biodiversity, \r\nincluding climate change-driven impacts, such as ocean \r\nacidification, are among a number of serious threats \r\nto the health and resilience of our shared ocean. They \r\nare not merely threats to our oceans; they constitute a \r\nserious challenge to our sustainable development and \r\nability to meet the aspirations embodied in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. Among other \r\nthings, healthy, productive, and resilient oceans and seas \r\nare critical to poverty eradication, access to adequate, \r\nsafe and nutritious food, economic development and \r\nessential ecosystem services.\r\nWe are pleased that we have begun the work of \r\nthe Intergovernmental Conference on an international \r\nlegally binding instrument under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity of \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction. We underscore \r\nthe importance of a legal instrument that is equitable, \r\nrecognizes the special case of small island developing \r\nStates, ensures respect for traditional knowledge and \r\nwill contribute to a healthy ocean for future generations.\r\nConcerning the issue of fisheries, we want to point \r\nout that they are the lifeblood of sustainable development \r\nfor many of our States. We therefore urge our partners \r\nin the upcoming meeting of the Western and Central \r\nPacific Fisheries Commission to support measures that \r\nwill enable our tropical tuna stocks to continue to stay at \r\nlevels that can produce at least the maximum sustainable \r\nyield. It is critical for our economies that we not relax \r\nthe controls that have enabled us to move those stocks \r\ninto the green zone. For Pacific SIDS, keeping central \r\nand western Pacific tuna stocks sustainable — not just \r\nbiologically sustainable, but at a sufficiently elevated \r\nlevel to support unsubsidized fisheries — is a matter of \r\nnational economic survival. Most Pacific SIDS are 100 \r\nto 1,000 times more economically dependent on tuna \r\nfisheries than other distant-water nations, and the atoll \r\ncountries are in double jeopardy. As we go to this year’s \r\nmeeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries \r\nCommission, with our eyes wide open, we hope that \r\nour friends at the United Nations — the delegations of \r\ndeveloped States that are so generous with development \r\nadvice and support — will be able to persuade their \r\nfisheries negotiators back home to stop undermining \r\ntheir work. There are two paths to development. \r\nOne involves handouts. The other involves creating \r\nan enabling environment for sustainable economic \r\nactivity. Only one of them can succeed.\r\nWe would like to note that the oceans are a deeply \r\ninterconnected space and that it is important to address \r\nfragmentation in that regard. We see a role for UN-\r\nOceans to enable better coordination and cohesion of \r\nUnited Nations work in this area. Finally, we commend \r\nthe General Assembly for reaffirming its commitment to \r\nthe full implementation of the Small Island Developing \r\nStates Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 9/32\r\nPathway and ensuring its success in convening, in \r\nSeptember 2019, a one-day high-level review of the \r\nprogress made. We look forward to working with the \r\nGeneral Assembly and with delegations in the coming \r\nyear to take the steps necessary to ensure that we can \r\nbequeath a healthy, productive and resilient ocean to \r\nfuture generations.\r\nMrs. Deiye (Nauru): I am pleased to deliver this \r\nstatement on behalf of the 14 States members of the \r\nPacific Islands Forum with Permanent Missions at the \r\nUnited Nations in New York.\r\nFirst, I want to thank the co-facilitators, Ms. Natalie \r\nMorris-Sharma of Singapore and Mr. Andreas Kravik \r\nof Norway, for bringing the negotiations on the \r\noceans omnibus draft resolution on the law of the sea \r\n(A/73/L.35) and the draft resolution on sustainable \r\nfisheries (A/73/L.41) to a successful conclusion. We \r\nlook forward to their adoption.\r\nThe members of the Pacific Islands Forum \r\nshare a strong and united interest in the oceans and \r\ntheir resources.We have long recognized the increasing \r\nthreats to the long-term health of the oceans, and \r\nwe share the common objectives of harnessing the \r\nvalue of the marine resources in our region and, as \r\njoint custodians, ensuring their conservation and \r\nsustainable use, which have underpinned the work of \r\nthe Forum around the theme “The blue Pacific — our \r\nsea of islands”.\r\nThe leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum met \r\nin Nauru in September with a focus on the theme of \r\n“Building a strong Pacific: our people, our islands, our \r\nwill”, in recognition of the opportunity that the theme \r\npresents to strengthen the region’s collective will to \r\novercome the persistent development challenges faced \r\nby the people of the Pacific face. Our leaders took a \r\nnumber of significant decisions to advance regional \r\ncooperation on a range of issues directly relevant \r\nboth to the work of the General Assembly on oceans \r\nand fisheries matters and to the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14. Most notably, the \r\nForum leaders concluded a new regional security \r\nagreement, the Boe Declaration on Regional Security. \r\nThat important initiative commits Pacific countries to \r\ngreater cooperation on combating illegal fishing, drug \r\ntrafficking and other transnational crimes.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum leaders also \r\nacknowledged the urgency and importance of securing \r\nthe region’s maritime boundaries as a key issue for the \r\ndevelopment and security of the Pacific region. We \r\nare therefore prioritizing action on maritime boundary \r\ndelimitation and the resolution of outstanding maritime \r\nboundary claims. The leaders further agreed to take \r\naction on important environmental initiatives. For \r\nexample, they committed to eliminating marine litter, \r\nin alignment with the Pacific Regional Action Plan on \r\nMarine Litter for the period from 2018 to 2025.\r\nA healthy, productive and resilient ocean is \r\ncritically important to our oceanic region. We welcome \r\nthe continued emphasis on the universal and unified \r\ncharacter of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS), which is the recognized \r\nand accepted constitution of the ocean and the legal \r\nframework under which all activities in the oceans \r\nand seas should be carried out. We also appreciate the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s continued attention to sustainable \r\nfisheries, which are an important resource for millions \r\nof people in our region and essential to the long-term \r\nhealth of the oceans and our economic development. \r\nWe are pleased that the draft resolution on sustainable \r\nfisheries reaffirms the importance of sustainable \r\nfisheries management, including for highly migratory \r\nfish stocks, and that it calls for continued efforts in \r\nthat area.\r\nWe further commend the General Assembly for \r\nreaffirming its commitment to the full implementation \r\nof the Small Island Developing States Accelerated \r\nModalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway and for \r\nensuring its success in convening a one-day high-level \r\nreview in September 2019 of the progress made so far. \r\nWe are pleased that the oceans omnibus draft resolution \r\ntakes note of the multinational partnership of the \r\nPhoenix Islands Protected Area and encourages States \r\nto consider implementing the International Maritime \r\nOrganization guidelines on ships’ biofouling in order \r\nto minimize the transfer of invasive aquatic species.\r\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nhighlight two particular issues of interest. The first is \r\nthe ongoing process that we have undertaken through \r\nthe Intergovernmental Conference on an international \r\nlegally binding Instrument under UNCLOS on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. \r\nOur Forum leaders underscored the importance of \r\nthe creation of a legal instrument that introduces \r\ninternational management mechanisms that allow for \r\nthe comprehensive and effective management of areas \r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n10/32 18-42609\r\nbeyond national jurisdiction and marine biodiversity, \r\nwithout undermining existing efforts and mechanisms.\r\nThe second issue is the effects of climate change, \r\nsuch as rising sea levels. Earlier this year, our Forum \r\nleaders reaffirmed that climate change presents the \r\nsingle greatest threat to the livelihood, security and \r\nwell-being of Pacific people. The recently released \r\nspecial report of the Intergovernmental Panel on \r\nClimate Change on what can be expected with global \r\nwarming of 2°C as compared to 1.5°C, sends a stark \r\nmessage to many of our States. It states that increasing \r\nwarming amplifies the exposure of small islands, low-\r\nlying coastal areas and deltas to the risks associated \r\nwith sea-level rise for many human and ecological \r\nsystems, including increased saltwater intrusion, \r\nf looding and damage to infrastructure. For our region, \r\nit is an existential threat.\r\nIt is therefore not surprising that the subject is one \r\nof utmost importance, particularly for low-lying small \r\nisland States in the Pacific. The impact on Pacific \r\ncommunities is more varied and complex than is often \r\nassumed. We are concerned about the possibility that \r\nsalinization will threaten crops and livelihoods and \r\ncoastal erosion will result in more destructive storm \r\nsurges and natural disasters. We are also concerned \r\nabout the potential impact of sea-level rise on our \r\nmaritime zones, from which we generate significant \r\nrevenue and with which we have a close cultural \r\nconnection. The rights of archipelagic States under the \r\nlaw of the sea should also be taken into account in that \r\nregard. We call on the General Assembly to remain \r\nfocused and to take action on this important matter.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMs. Gauci (European Union): I am speaking on \r\nbehalf of the European Union (EU) and its member States. \r\nThe candidate countries the former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania; the \r\ncountry of the Stabilization and Association Process \r\nand potential candidate Bosnia and Herzegovina; as \r\nwell as Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia, \r\nalign themselves with this statement.\r\nWe are meeting today to adopt two important draft \r\nresolutions, on oceans and the law of the sea (A/73/L.35) \r\nand sustainable fisheries (A/73/L.41). As committed \r\nparties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea (UNCLOS) and its implementing agreements, \r\nincluding the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation \r\nof the Law of the Sea Convention relating to the \r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish \r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the EU and \r\nits member States have participated actively in the \r\nconsultations to prepare these draft resolutions.\r\nThe EU and its member States are satisfied that \r\nboth draft resolutions continue to reflect significant \r\ndevelopments in important processes related to the \r\noceans and the law of the sea and fisheries. In view \r\nof the recognition accorded to the central role of \r\noceans and seas in the context of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, we continue to believe \r\nthat these draft resolutions should serve to focus the \r\nattention of the Assembly and the general public on \r\nimportant issues in the marine domain, including \r\nfisheries and marine environment.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea, with its 168 parties, including the European \r\nUnion, is rightly recognized, including by the EU and \r\nits member States, as the constitution of the oceans, \r\nas well as a reflection of international customary law. \r\nUNCLOS establishes the overarching legal framework \r\nwithin which all activities in oceans and seas must be \r\ncarried out. By establishing the legal order for seas and \r\noceans, it continues to contribute to peace, security, \r\ncooperation and friendly relations among all nations as \r\nwell as to sustainable development. We sincerely hope \r\nthat the goal of universal participation in the Convention \r\nwill one day be met. We nevertheless acknowledge \r\nthe necessity of ensuring that the Convention remains \r\nrelevant and able to meet today’s challenges as well as \r\nthose of the future.\r\nThe European Union and its member States are \r\ntherefore pleased to recognize the good progress \r\nachieved in the first substantive session of the \r\nIntergovernmental Conference established to negotiate \r\nan international legally binding instrument under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. The \r\nsuccessful conclusion of that first session constituted \r\nan important step towards a new implementing \r\nagreement, which remains a political priority for the \r\nEU and its member States. We would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Conference, Ambassador Rena Lee, for \r\nher excellent work and leadership in that regard, as well \r\nall delegations for their constructive participation. We \r\nlook forward to continuing this important work at the \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 11/32\r\ntwo upcoming sessions of the Conference in 2019, as \r\nwell as in between sessions.\r\nIn line with the commitments undertaken in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and elsewhere, \r\nthe EU and its member States remain committed to \r\nachieving healthy and productive oceans and seas so that \r\nthey can continue to support sustainable development \r\nfor the good of all humankind. Nevertheless, we \r\nremain concerned that despite our shared efforts, \r\nour oceans continue to face significant threats and \r\nchallenges, including climate change and increasing \r\natmospheric carbon dioxide levels, resulting in oceans \r\nthat are warmer and more acidic, rising sea levels and \r\nextreme weather events; pollution such as plastics and \r\nmicroplastics, excessive nutrients and increasing levels \r\nof sound and anthropogenic underwater noise, as amply \r\ndemonstrated at this year’s nineteenth meeting of the \r\nInformal Consultative Process; overfishing and illegal, \r\nunregulated and unreported fishing, with a large \r\npercentage of assessed stocks classified as overfished, \r\naccording to the report of the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) entitled State \r\nof World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2018.\r\nIf we are to succeed in ensuring that the oceans are \r\nclean, healthy and productive, and keeping them that \r\nway, those global threats require enhanced cooperation \r\nand coordination and our firm collective political \r\ncommitment and effective action in line with the \r\nprecautionary principle and the ecosystem approach. \r\nWe believe that is ever more necessary in view of the \r\ngrowing importance of sustainable ocean economies, \r\nalso known as the blue economy, to many countries \r\naround the world.\r\nThe EU and its member States want to take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate their strong commitment to \r\nconcluding the negotiations on multilateral disciplines \r\non fisheries subsidies in the context of the World Trade \r\nOrganization, in line with commitments under the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. We continue \r\nto maintain that harmful subsidies that contribute to \r\novercapacity, overfishing and illegal, unregulated and \r\nunreported fishing are one of the main impediments to \r\nachieving sustainable fisheries. While we are pleased \r\nto see the growing number of parties to the FAO \r\nAgreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter \r\nand Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated \r\nFishing, we nonetheless reiterate the call to more States \r\nto become parties to that Agreement.\r\nThe EU and its member States would also like \r\nto touch on two social and human issues. First, we \r\nreiterate the importance of ensuring decent working \r\nconditions on board fishing vessels. We therefore \r\nencourage States to become parties to the Work in \r\nFishing Convention, 2007 (No. 188), of the International \r\nLabour Organization. Secondly, we want to highlight \r\nthe importance of resolving as soon as possible the \r\nlong-standing issue of medical insurance coverage for \r\nthe members of the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf so that they can proceed with their \r\nimportant work in the knowledge that they have access \r\nto adequate medical coverage while in New York.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to express our \r\nappreciation for the excellent stewardship demonstrated \r\nby both coordinators of the two draft resolutions, \r\nMs. Natalie Morris-Sharma and Mr. Andreas Kravik. \r\nWe also recognize the constructive participation of \r\nother delegations in these negotiations, which ensured \r\nthe inclusion of numerous important topical issues in \r\nthe draft resolutions. In that spirit, we also appreciate \r\nour common endeavours to make the draft resolutions \r\nmore effective and relevant, including through the \r\nongoing streamlining efforts.\r\nWe would also like to thank the Chairs of the \r\ndifferent United Nations meetings throughout the year, \r\nwhose able leadership guided the work of delegations. \r\nWe look forward to continuing that work at the various \r\nevents throughout 2019, as well as the negotiations on \r\nmarine biological diversity of areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction. The EU and its member States would like \r\nto express their gratitude to the Secretariat and to the \r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for \r\ntheir excellent work and constant support throughout \r\nthe year.\r\nMr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nOceans are an important arena for global cooperation \r\nand development. All States should jointly promote the \r\nmaritime rule of law and the sustainable development \r\nof the oceans. In that connection, I would like to share \r\nChina’s position and views.\r\nFirst, in order to strengthen global ocean governance \r\nand contribute to humankind’s shared future, China is \r\nready to join with other countries under the principles \r\nof extensive consultation, joint contributions and \r\nshared benefits in order to work actively to build a \r\ntwenty-first-century maritime Silk Road and establish \r\na multidimensional, multilevel and broad-based blue \r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n12/32 18-42609\r\npartnership, thereby moving closer to achieving a \r\ncommunity with a shared future in ocean affairs.\r\nSecondly, in order to develop the blue economy \r\nand to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nChina is committed to striking the appropriate balance \r\nbetween the protection of the oceans on the one hand, \r\nand their sustainable use on the other, and is actively \r\nimplementing Sustainable Development Goal 14. \r\nWe welcome the convening of the United Nations \r\nOcean Conference and the Sustainable Blue Economy \r\nConference. We hope that all States will work together \r\nto turn political will into concrete action.\r\nThirdly, in order to promote the international rule \r\nof law in the field of ocean affairs and uphold a fair \r\nand reasonable maritime order, the 1982 United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea provides a general \r\nlegal framework for maritime activities and serves \r\nas their fundamental basis. Meanwhile, matters not \r\nregulated by the Convention continue to be governed by \r\nthe rules and principles of general international law. All \r\nparties must take an objective and impartial approach \r\nto interpreting and applying the rules of international \r\nmaritime law, including the Convention, in good faith.\r\nIn the past year, good progress was made in the work \r\nof the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, \r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \r\nand the International Seabed Authority, contributing to \r\nefforts to settle maritime disputes peacefully, define \r\nthe outer limits of the continental shelf of a coastal \r\nState beyond 200 nautical miles and apply the principle \r\nof the common heritage of humankind. China hopes \r\nthat these three bodies will remain committed to \r\neffectively discharging their responsibilities in earnest, \r\nas mandated by the Convention.\r\nAs for the formulation of an international \r\ninstrument on the biological diversity of areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction, the Intergovernmental Conference \r\non the issue was formally launched last September. \r\nNegotiations on that instrument should follow the \r\nprinciple of consensus and advance gradually on the \r\nbasis of that consensus so as to arrive at a regime that is \r\nrational, balanced, pragmatic, feasible and conducive to \r\nthe common interests of member States and the overall \r\ninterests of the international community as a whole.\r\nAs for the formulation of international regulations \r\non seabed exploitation, China submitted its comments \r\non the updated draft regulations last September. \r\nThey should follow the Convention and its 1994 \r\nImplementation Agreement in letter and in spirit, and \r\naim at encouraging and facilitating the exploitation \r\nof resources in the Area as well as effectively \r\nprotecting the marine environment. The regulations \r\nshould be formulated step by step on a basis of hard \r\nfacts, solid scientific evidence and learning from \r\nnational experience.\r\nChina is committed to strengthening international \r\ncooperation and capacity-building in ocean affairs. \r\nThis year we hosted conferences that included the \r\nsixth International Symposium on Scientific and Legal \r\nAspects of the Regimes of the Continental Shelf and \r\nthe Area, an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation \r\nworkshop on innovative marine debris solutions, an \r\ninternational symposium on biological diversity of \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction, and the United \r\nNations World Geospatial Information Congress, all \r\nwith fruitful results. China has consistently made \r\nfinancial contributions to the voluntary trust fund of \r\nthe International Seabed Authority and the Commission \r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf, with a view \r\nto facilitating developing countries’ participation in \r\nrelevant efforts.\r\nGlobal fisheries are closely linked to food and \r\nnutrition security, marine pollution control and \r\neco-environmental protection, and that calls for close \r\ncooperation among all parties. China is committed to \r\nthe sustainable development of fisheries, and I would \r\nlike to share some of our positions and proposals with \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nFirst, with regard to adhering to the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and promoting the rational \r\ndevelopment of fisheries resources, China has been \r\nactively developing healthy and sustainable aquaculture. \r\nWe attach great importance to the application of \r\necosystem approaches and preventive methods in \r\nfisheries management, as well as greater interaction \r\nbetween scientific assessments and fisheries policies.\r\nSecondly, with regard to improving our national \r\nlegal framework for fisheries and strengthening relevant \r\nlaw enforcement, China has established a complete \r\nframework of laws, regulations and management \r\nregimes governing fisheries, and has introduced \r\nmeasures such as licences for building fishing vessels \r\nand fishing permits to strengthen the supervision \r\nand management of access to fisheries. China has \r\nalso enhanced its maritime law enforcement and port \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 13/32\r\ninspections, effectively implementing its domestic law \r\nand fulfilling the relevant international obligations.\r\nThirdly, China has participated extensively in \r\ninternational cooperation to combat illegal, unreported \r\nand unregulated fishing, has been actively engaged \r\nin bilateral and multilateral fisheries management \r\ncooperation, is deeply involved in the work of the \r\nrelevant regional fisheries management organizations \r\nand strictly complies with their conservation and \r\nmanagement measures. China has followed a zero-\r\ntolerance approach to all types of illegal fishing to \r\nmake sure that every reported case is investigated and \r\nthat, once proven guilty, every perpetrator is convicted.\r\nRegional fisheries management organizations \r\nare important frameworks identified in the 1995 \r\nAgreement for the Implementation of the Provisions \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation \r\nand Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly \r\nMigratory Fish Stocks. China supports the holding in \r\n2019 of the fourteenth round of informal consultations \r\nof States Parties to the Agreement to exchange views on \r\nthe topic of “Performance reviews of regional fisheries \r\nmanagement organizations and arrangements”.\r\nChina notes that draft resolution A/73/L.41 requests \r\nthe Secretary-General to invite the relevant parties, \r\nincluding regional fisheries management organizations, \r\nto submit their views on the topic, and requests the \r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea to \r\npost them on its website. In that regard, China urges \r\nthe Division to fulfil its duties and responsibilities on \r\nthe basis of past practice, properly address the concerns \r\nof all parties and facilitate the informal consultation \r\nprocess so that it plays a positive role in promoting \r\nsustainable fisheries.\r\nIn our efforts to contribute to the shared future of our \r\noceans and seas, promote the sustainable development \r\nof marine resources and uphold the international law \r\nof the sea, China stands ready to continue to work with \r\nother countries in a concerted effort to facilitate the \r\ndevelopment of the law of the sea and the international \r\nfisheries-management regime and make a greater \r\ncontribution to building a beautiful blue home.\r\nMs. Palau-Hernandez (United States of America): \r\nThe United States is pleased to be a sponsor of draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.35, entitled “Oceans and the law of \r\nthe sea”.\r\nThe United States underscores the central \r\nimportance of international law as reflected in the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\nwhose universal and unified character is emphasized \r\nin the draft resolution. As we witness attempts to \r\nimpede the lawful exercise of navigational rights and \r\nfreedoms under international law, it is more important \r\nthan ever to remain steadfast in our resolve to uphold \r\nthose rights and freedoms. In that regard, we call on all \r\nStates to formulate their maritime claims and conduct \r\ntheir activities in the maritime domain in accordance \r\nwith international law, as reflected in the Convention, \r\nto respect the freedoms of navigation and overflight \r\nand other lawful uses of the sea that all users of the \r\nmaritime domain enjoy, and to peacefully settle disputes \r\nin accordance with international law.\r\nThe United States values the platform that the \r\nGeneral Assembly provides to elevate these important \r\nissues. The annual adoption of a resolution on oceans \r\nand the law of the sea serves as an invaluable opportunity \r\nfor the global community to identify key ocean issues \r\nand develop constructive ways to address them.\r\nWe are particularly pleased that this year’s draft \r\nresolution gives further support to the United Nations \r\nDecade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, \r\nby deciding on the theme of ocean science for the 2019 \r\nInformal Consultative Process on oceans and the law of \r\nthe sea. The 2019 meeting of the Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the \r\nSea will be an excellent venue for soliciting ideas and \r\nfeedback from the international community on critical \r\ngaps in our knowledge that the Decade of Ocean Science \r\ncan fill, allowing us to seek science-based solutions for \r\nsustaining benefits from the ocean.\r\nWe are also pleased that this year’s draft resolution \r\nrecognizes many of the significant global and regional \r\nefforts to reduce plastic in the ocean. Marine debris, \r\nlargely composed of plastic waste from land-based \r\nsources, imposes significant social and economic \r\ncosts, threatening human well-being, food security and \r\nmarine ecosystems. We support the draft resolution’s \r\ncontinued encouragement of all stakeholders to \r\ncooperate on environmentally sound and pragmatic \r\nmeasures to prevent and reduce marine debris.\r\nOne of the most important aspects of this year’s \r\ndraft resolution is related not to text that was added but \r\nto text that was updated, reorganized or, in some cases, \r\nremoved. We thank all delegations for the concerted \r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n14/32 18-42609\r\nand serious effort to make this lengthy draft resolution \r\nmore accessible and more relevant. We look forward to \r\ncontinuing those efforts next year.\r\nWe would like to congratulate the Government \r\nof Indonesia on hosting another highly successful \r\nOur Ocean Conference, providing an unparalleled \r\nopportunity for all stakeholders — the business \r\ncommunity, the science and technology community, \r\nGovernments, non-governmental organizations and \r\nfunders — to address a common goal, the collaborative \r\nmanagement and sustainable use of our ocean and its \r\nresources. Building on the success of the previous \r\nConferences, hosted by Chile, the European Union \r\nand the United States, the participants at this year’s \r\nConference in Bali announced commitments of more \r\nthan $10 billion to address key issues facing the \r\noceans, including combating marine debris, advancing \r\nmaritime security and promoting sustainable fisheries. \r\nWe look forward to the 2019 Conference in Norway, as \r\nwell as the Conferences in Palau in 2020 and Panama \r\nin 2021.\r\nWe would also like to express our appreciation for \r\nthe important leadership of Ms. Rena Lee of Singapore \r\nin her role as President of the Intergovernmental \r\nConference on an international instrument regarding the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. We \r\nlook forward to working with delegations as the \r\nIntergovernmental Conference continues and hope to \r\nhave a broadly supported result that takes into account \r\nthe views of all delegations.\r\nI now turn to draft resolution A/73/L.41, on \r\nsustainable fisheries. We greatly value the important \r\nwork being done throughout the world on sustainable \r\nfisheries management, which helps to support \r\neconomic activity and healthy marine ecosystems \r\naround the world. The draft resolution plays an \r\nimportant role in highlighting achievements and \r\npriorities for future progress, including with regard \r\nto achieving sustainable fisheries, implementing \r\ninternational fisheries agreements, combating illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing and strengthening \r\nfisheries governance.\r\nThis year’s draft resolution includes several \r\nimportant additions, including in relation to the recent \r\nconclusion of the Agreement to Prevent Unregulated \r\nHigh Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean and \r\nthe work being done to support implementation of the \r\nAgreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter \r\nand Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated \r\nFishing. We would also like to note the paragraphs \r\nrelated to the thirteenth round of informal consultations \r\nof States parties, which focused on the science-policy \r\ninterface, and to thank Mr. Fábio Hazin of Brazil for \r\nhis leadership and for once again chairing the informal \r\nconsultations of States parties. We think that the new \r\napproach to the informal consultations of States parties, \r\nwhereby we focus the agenda on a specific issue arising \r\nfrom the implementation of the 1995 Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory \r\nFish Stocks, should facilitate more substantive and \r\nconstructive discussions. We look forward to the \r\ninformal consultations to be convened under a similar \r\nformat next year, and encourage robust participation in \r\nthat meeting.\r\nWhile we strongly support a great deal of the \r\ndraft resolution, the United States continues to have \r\nsignificant concerns about certain paragraphs in it, \r\nin particular those pertaining to the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) and trade negotiations occurring \r\noutside the mandate of the United Nations. Language \r\nin General Assembly texts on matters of trade policy \r\nhas no standing for the United States, including for its \r\nwork at the WTO. In particular, the United States notes \r\nthat paragraph 124 contains outdated references to the \r\nDoha Development Agenda. At the tenth Ministerial \r\nConference of the WTO in December 2015, WTO \r\nmembers did not reaffirm the Doha Development \r\nAgenda. WTO members are no longer negotiating under \r\nthat framework, and the reference to Doha therefore \r\nhas no standing here. The United States has also made \r\nclear its opposition to paragraph 125, as well as other \r\nparagraphs that mention the WTO and market access.\r\nIt is our view that the United Nations must respect \r\nthe independent mandates of other processes and \r\ninstitutions, including trade negotiations, and that \r\nit must not involve itself in decisions and actions \r\nunder way in other forums, including the WTO. The \r\nUnited Nations is not the appropriate venue for those \r\ndiscussions, and there should be no expectation or \r\nmisconception that the United States would heed \r\nlanguage negotiated at the General Assembly on such \r\nissues. That includes calls that undermine incentives \r\nfor innovation, such as technology transfer that is not \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 15/32\r\nvoluntary and on mutually agreed terms, including in \r\nthe preamble and in paragraphs 222 and 229.\r\nWe regret that consensus could not be reached \r\non the need to change those trade-related paragraphs \r\nto ensure that the draft resolution remains relevant \r\nand focused on sustainable fisheries priorities under \r\nthe mandate of the United Nations. We would like to \r\nrequest that Member States work constructively with us \r\nto address concerns about trade-related language in any \r\nsuch draft resolution next year.\r\nOur decision to join the consensus on this draft \r\nresolution is based on our strong support for the vast \r\nmajority of the non-trade-related language that it \r\ncontains. It also reflects the importance that the United \r\nStates, as an effective steward of the nation’s marine \r\nresources, a responsible f lag State and a leader in \r\nregional fisheries management organizations and other \r\ninternational forums, places on sustainable fisheries.\r\nThe United States looks forward to continuing to \r\nwork with other nations to address overfishing, combat \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, promote \r\na level playing field and advance the key issues in \r\nsustainable fisheries management highlighted in the \r\ndraft resolution.\r\nWith regard to references to the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development in both draft resolutions, on \r\nsustainable fisheries and on oceans, we addressed our \r\nconcerns about such references in a general explanation \r\nof position delivered in the Second Committee on \r\n8 November and in an explanation of position regarding \r\nresolution 73/24, entitled “Sport as an enabler of \r\nsustainable development”, under agenda item 12, \r\nadopted on 3 December (see A/73/PV.44).\r\nWith regard to references to the Paris Climate \r\nChange Agreement and to the subject of climate change \r\nin the draft resolutions, we addressed our concerns about \r\nsuch references in our general explanation of position \r\ndelivered in the Second Committee on 8 November. We \r\nnote that the United States Administration announced \r\nits intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement \r\nas soon as it is eligible to do so, consistent with the \r\nterms of the Agreement, unless suitable terms for \r\nre-engagement are identified.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to thank Ms. Natalie \r\nMorris-Sharma of Singapore for her outstanding \r\ncoordination of the draft resolution on the oceans, and \r\nin particular for her encouragement of efforts to update \r\nand reorganize it. We also greatly appreciate the tireless \r\nefforts of the coordinator of the informal consultations \r\non the sustainable fisheries draft resolution, \r\nMr. Andreas Kravik of Norway, in effectively guiding \r\nMember States through the challenging negotiations.\r\nWe would also like to thank the Director and staff \r\nof the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the \r\nSea, and the interpreters, for their expertise, hard work \r\nand patience throughout the consultations on both \r\ndraft resolutions. Finally, we would like to express \r\nour appreciation to delegations for their hard work and \r\ncooperation in negotiating both draft resolutions. It is \r\nour hope that this spirit of cooperation will characterize \r\nour efforts to address the numerous and complex issues \r\nthat lie ahead.\r\nMs. Ellertsdottir (Iceland): The two draft \r\nresolutions under discussion today, on sustainable \r\nfisheries (A/73/L.41) and oceans and the law of the \r\nsea (A/73/L.35), relate to issues that are at the core \r\nof Iceland’s economy, history and identity, indeed its \r\nvery existence. It is therefore difficult to overstate the \r\nimportance of this topic for Iceland since the issues \r\naddressed in these draft resolutions touch on central \r\nissues for Iceland’s foreign, economic and trade policies.\r\nIceland participated actively in the negotiations on \r\nthe two draft resolutions and we are happy to be among \r\ntheir sponsors. We would like to take this opportunity \r\nto express our thanks to the two coordinators who ably \r\nguided our discussions, Mr. Andreas Kravik of Norway, \r\non sustainable fisheries, and Ms. Natalie Morris-\r\nSharma of Singapore, on oceans and the law of the sea. \r\nIn keeping with established practice, that work was \r\nguided by the principle of consensus, which may not \r\nalways appear to be the fastest way forward but remains \r\nthe only safe way to reach our destination. It is therefore \r\na demanding job to coordinate the negotiations and \r\nboth Ms. Morris-Sharma and Mr. Kravik demonstrated \r\nadmirable tact, diplomacy and wisdom in steering us \r\ntowards a successful outcome.\r\nWe would like to note in particular that this year \r\nwe started the important work of streamlining the draft \r\nresolution on oceans and the law of the sea. Given \r\nthe importance of the topics addressed in this draft \r\nresolution, we welcome this effort to make it more \r\nreadable, concise and relevant, and we look forward to \r\ncontinuing our work in this regard.\r\nI also want to take this opportunity to express our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his reports on \r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n16/32 18-42609\r\noceans and the law of the sea (A/73/68 and A/73/368) \r\nand to the Secretariat in general, and the Division for \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea in particular, for \r\ntheir valuable work and contributions.\r\nThe mandate of the Commission on the Limits \r\nof the Continental Shelf continues to be extremely \r\nimportant and it remains essential to ensure that the \r\nCommission’s work is based on thorough deliberations \r\nand respect for its procedures, and that its conclusions \r\nare founded on sound arguments. In this regard, \r\nmy delegation would like to express its gratitude for \r\nthe hard work and dedication of the members of the \r\nCommission. Two important developments related \r\nto the work of the Commission in this year’s draft \r\nresolutions are worth highlighting.\r\nFirst, the members of the Commission have the \r\noption to join the Headquarters medical insurance \r\nscheme, as has already been mentioned here. The \r\nworking conditions of the Commission have been under \r\ndiscussion for a long time and it is our hope that this \r\nnew option will be a positive contribution to that debate.\r\nSecondly, the draft resolution contains the revised \r\nterms of reference of the trust fund established for the \r\npurpose of facilitating the preparation of submissions to \r\nthe Commission. The changes to the terms of reference \r\nwill hopefully enable developing States, in particular \r\nleast developed countries and small island developing \r\nStates, to make better use of the trust fund during the \r\nconsideration of their submissions to the Commission. \r\nWe welcome both of these developments, as each in its \r\nown way represents an important contribution to the \r\nfurther strengthening of Commission’s work.\r\nOver the years the General Assembly has \r\nconsistently highlighted the universal and unified \r\ncharacter of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea, its strategic importance and the \r\ncontribution it makes to peace, security and friendly \r\nrelations among all nations. It is worth emphasixing \r\nthat this robust legal framework already regulates all \r\nactivities in the oceans. It is complemented by the 1995 \r\nAgreement for the Implementation of the Provisions \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation \r\nand Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly \r\nMigratory Fish Stocks and its provisions on high seas \r\nfisheries and the regulatory framework for the work of \r\nregional fisheries management organizations.\r\nWe have now embarked on a new, complementary \r\nprocess to develop an international legally binding \r\ninstrument, under the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea, on the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of marine biological diversity of areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction. Iceland welcomes the formal start \r\nof these negotiations and we will continue to participate \r\nin them actively and constructively. In particular, we \r\nwould like to stress that this process and its result \r\nshould not undermine but rather build on existing \r\nlegal instruments and frameworks, especially the \r\nConvention and the 1995 Agreement on Fish Stocks. The \r\nnegotiations on the biological diversity of areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction are not the appropriate forum for \r\nreopening issues that have already been already settled. \r\nMy delegation would also like to stress that while the \r\nissues under discussion are complex and views differ \r\non the appropriate legal framework in which to address \r\nthem, it is imperative to ensure that this work continues \r\nto be guided by consensus, as it is the only way we can \r\nachieve universal application of this instrument.\r\nWithout a clean, healthy and productive ocean, the \r\n2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development will be nearly \r\nimpossible to attain. The sustainable management of \r\nnatural resources is fundamental to our success, and \r\nwhere the seas and oceans are concerned, there is great \r\npotential for innovation and growth in a number of \r\nsectors that could contribute to poverty eradication and \r\nsustained economic growth.\r\nClimate change and its effects are among the most \r\npressing concerns of our times. Addressing climate \r\nchange is a prerequisite for healthy and sustainable \r\noceans. Iceland has already witnessed the consequences \r\nof climate change — rising ocean temperatures \r\nhave influenced the migration patterns of our fish \r\nstocks — and it has therefore had a direct impact on \r\nour policies and our cooperation with other States.\r\nThere are few places in which the impact of climate \r\nchange is more evident than the Arctic, where the sea \r\nice is continuing to recede. Earlier this year, Iceland \r\nand nine other parties signed the Agreement to Prevent \r\nUnregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic \r\nOcean. The Agreement is an example of States adopting \r\nthe precautionary approach in practice, as the parties \r\nto the Agreement have committed to refraining from \r\nany commercial fishing in the high-seas portion of the \r\ncentral Arctic Ocean until a scientific framework and \r\nproper management measures and procedures are in \r\nplace. Through that commitment, the parties want to \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 17/32\r\nensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use \r\nof fish stocks in an area where fishing has to date been \r\nimpossible but which is undergoing rapid change.\r\nOcean science must take centre stage in the \r\ndebate on oceans and sustainable development. \r\nIceland would therefore like to welcome the General \r\nAssembly’s decision last year to proclaim the next \r\ndecade the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science \r\nfor Sustainable Development. We also welcome the \r\nproposal in this year’s draft resolution to focus the \r\ndiscussions in next year’s meeting of the Open-ended \r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law \r\nof the Sea on the theme “Ocean science and the United \r\nNations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment”. We find it particularly apt that the \r\nInformal Consultative Process will devote its twentieth \r\nsession to this important cross-cutting theme relating \r\nto all aspects of our work.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to participating in \r\nnext year’s Informal Consultative Process and all the \r\nother important meetings, events and processes relating \r\nto oceans and the law of the sea scheduled for next year.\r\nMr. Namazu (Japan): I would like to join other \r\nspeakers in thanking the coordinators for their \r\ndedicated work on the two draft resolutions (A/73/L.35 \r\nand A/73/L.41) under agenda item 78, “Oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea”. Japan would also like to express its \r\nappreciation for the contributions of our fellow Member \r\nStates and the assistance of the Secretariat.\r\nJapan underscores the importance of open seas \r\nand the rule of law as part of the foundations of \r\npeace and security. We support the universality of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\nwhich regulates freedom of navigation and freedom \r\non the high seas, the entitlement to the oceans, the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the protection \r\nand preservation of the marine environment. We \r\nbelieve that it is the responsibility of the international \r\ncommunity, which would benefit from it, to promote \r\nand develop an ever more predictable maritime order \r\nunder the Convention. This year’s draft resolution on \r\noceans and the law of the sea (A/73/L.35) confirms \r\nour commitment to a rules-based maritime order and \r\ncovers a wide range of oceanic issues, and Japan has \r\ntherefore sponsored it once again.\r\nJapan has been contributing actively to international \r\norganizations established under the Convention, \r\nproviding them with both human and financial \r\nresources. We appreciate the role of the International \r\nSeabed Authority. A key part of sustainable seabed \r\nmanagement is the sharing of skills and knowledge, and \r\nJapan remains active in that area. To take one example, \r\nearlier this year a Japanese contractor, the Japan Oil, Gas \r\nand Metals National Corporation, invited four trainees \r\nfrom outside Japan to participate for more than a month \r\nin a programme that included training at sea. Another \r\ncontractor, Deep Ocean Resources Development, plans \r\nto offer a similar programme for five trainees next year. \r\nJapan hopes that these overseas trainees will take full \r\nadvantage of this opportunity and play active roles in \r\nmaritime affairs in their home countries.\r\nJapan recognizes the importance of conserving \r\nthe marine biological diversity of areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction. We support the development \r\nof a well-balanced, effective, universal and legally \r\nbinding instrument under the Convention on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of biological diversity \r\nof areas beyond national jurisdiction, and have actively \r\ncontributed to discussions to that end, including at the \r\nongoing Intergovernmental Conference. In October \r\nJapan submitted measures at the fifth Ocean Conference \r\non improving marine law-enforcement capacity and \r\nfurthering international cooperation and research on \r\noceanic litter and debris in Asia, among other things. \r\nAlso in October, Japan hosted the Asian-African Legal \r\nConsultative Organization’s annual session, where \r\nwe discussed the progress and future development \r\nof the law of the sea and marine order based on the \r\nConvention, and made a presentation on deep-seabed-\r\nresource development technology developed by Japan.\r\nFinally, Japan attaches great importance to \r\nmeasures against illegal, unreported and unregulated \r\nfishing, which threatens the sustainable use of \r\nliving marine resources. Last year we acceded to the \r\nAgreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter \r\nand Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated \r\nFishing, and we encourage countries that have not yet \r\ndone so to follow suit. Japan is determined to reinforce \r\nefforts to eradicate illegal, unreported and unregulated \r\nfishing in cooperation with other countries, including \r\nthrough regional fisheries-management organizations.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate Japan’s desire to \r\nsee the draft resolutions before us, which are the result \r\nof intensive and cooperative work by Member States, \r\nduly adopted by the General Assembly.\r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n18/32 18-42609\r\nMs. Shareef (Maldives): My delegation welcomes \r\nthe reports of the Secretary-General (A/73/68 and \r\nA/73/368) submitted under this agenda item, as well \r\nas the two draft resolutions (A/73/L.35 and A/73/L.41), \r\nwhich represent important developments related to \r\noceans and the law of the sea. We also thank Singapore \r\nand Norway for their able leadership of the consultations \r\nthat led to these texts.\r\nThe oceans are under threat. Pollution, overfishing, \r\nwarming temperatures and acidification are threatening \r\ntheir health and wealth. Scientists have repeatedly \r\nwarned us that unless there is a dramatic shift in human \r\nbehaviour, we may alter oceanographic processes that \r\nmoderate the global climate. We need to take action \r\nnow to save the oceans, and action against marine \r\nplastic pollution is a good starting point. Owing to \r\nrecent shifts in production and consumption patterns, \r\nplastic pollution has become a key challenge for our \r\ngeneration. For a country like the Maldives, with \r\nhundreds of islands and thousands of kilometres of \r\ncoastline, marine plastic pollution threatens the coral \r\nreefs, fish stocks and beaches that are the lifeblood \r\nof our two main industries, tourism and fishing. \r\nThat is why President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih of the \r\nMaldives launched a campaign against plastic pollution \r\nwithin weeks of taking office. The President’s Office, \r\nthe Foreign Ministry and several other Government \r\nagencies have now banned single-use plastics in their \r\noffices. The President’s initiative has received support \r\nfrom the private sector, especially the tourism industry, \r\nthat we believe is vital to reducing plastic pollution \r\nin our country. But the ocean is too vast for a single \r\ncountry, especially a small State such as the Maldives, \r\nto make a dramatic change in marine plastic pollution. \r\nThat requires global cooperation to ensure that every \r\ncountry, every region and every community in every \r\ncorner of the globe takes action to stop the menace of \r\nplastic pollution.\r\nMarine plastic pollution is just one dimension of \r\nthe constellation of threats facing the oceans. The most \r\nserious threat of all is global warming and sea-level \r\nrise. Global Warming of 1.5°C, the October 2018 special \r\nreport of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \r\nChange (IPCC), suggests there is catastrophic trouble \r\nahead for marine ecosystems if we fail to take dramatic \r\naction immediately to limit global warming to 1.5°C. If \r\nwe can stay below that critical temperature threshold, \r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS) will have more \r\nspace for adaptation, but we still face the potential of \r\nirreversible losses of marine and coastal ecosystems at \r\n1.5°C. In fact, between 70 and 90 per cent of coral reefs \r\nwill be severely degraded at 1.5°C of warming, and that \r\nincreases to 99 per cent at 2°C. We look forward to the \r\nfindings next year of an extension of the IPCC report \r\ndirectly related to ocean systems.\r\nGlobal warming poses an existential threat for the \r\nMaldives, which is one of the lowest-lying countries \r\nin the world. That is why since 1989 the Maldives has \r\npersisted in its advocacy for stronger action against sea-\r\nlevel rise. In November 1989 we hosted the first-ever \r\nSmall States Conference on Sea Level Rise and charted \r\na way forward for mitigating this threat. But today, \r\nalmost 30 years later, the world has failed to act. We are \r\nnow in a position where we need to seriously evaluate \r\nthe possible legal implications of sea-level rise. It has \r\nimplications for maritime boundaries and internal and \r\nexternal migration and, most important, it poses an \r\nexistential threat to low-lying countries like ours. My \r\ndelegation therefore welcomes this topic’s inclusion \r\nin the programme of work of the International Law \r\nCommission, and we encourage the Commission to \r\ntake it up with urgency.\r\nWe can protect and promote the health of the ocean \r\nonly if we are able to regulate the large swathes of deep \r\nblue ocean waters that are currently ungoverned. The \r\nMaldives welcomed the convening of the first meeting \r\nof the Intergovernmental Conference on an international \r\nlegally binding instrument under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity of \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction, which represents \r\na significant milestone in ocean governance and the \r\nculmination of decades of groundwork. The Maldives \r\nengaged constructively in those discussions with a view \r\nto finalizing the instrument as soon as possible, and we \r\nare confident that we can reach that goal. We want to \r\nreiterate the importance of ensuring that it ref lects the \r\nspecial circumstances of SIDS, as other instruments \r\nunder the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea have done.\r\nOur work related to the oceans and the law of the \r\nsea is only as good as the best available science we have. \r\nIn that regard, it is crucial to promote research in the \r\narea and to facilitate capacity-building and the transfer \r\nof marine technology so that developing countries can \r\nengage in and supplement ongoing efforts effectively. \r\nThe Maldives has been a strong advocate for the \r\nInternational Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 19/32\r\nDevelopment for the period from 2021 to 2030. We take \r\nnote of the progress that has been made in engaging \r\nstakeholders to formulate plans and encourage all \r\nMember States to engage constructively in tailoring a \r\nframework that will deliver country-driven results.\r\nThe world’s oceans literally connect us together \r\nand sustain life as we know it. From the top of the \r\nHimalayas to the sandy beaches of the Maldives just \r\nabove the sea, our future is bound to the health of \r\nthe marine environment. I ask everyone to join us in \r\nprotecting that valuable intergenerational resource.\r\nMr. Sandoval Mendiolea (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My delegation would like to thank the \r\nfacilitators of the draft resolutions on sustainable \r\nfisheries (A/73/L.41) and oceans and the law of the \r\nsea (A/73/L.35) for their work during the rounds \r\nof negotiations. Mexico has a particular interest in \r\ndevelopments in several of the issues addressed in the \r\nomnibus draft resolution, of which I will highlight \r\nsome specific aspects.\r\nAs a matter of principle, we affirm that the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) \r\nconstitutes the international regulatory framework \r\nwithin which all activities in the oceans and seas are \r\nconducted and which is central to cooperation in the \r\nmarine sector at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels. Its integrity must therefore always be maintained. \r\nWe want to take this opportunity to reiterate Mexico’s \r\nfull commitment to the sustainable development of \r\nthe oceans and seas, in accordance with Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 14. To that end, we are working at \r\nthe national level to encourage the use of the oceans and \r\nseas for peaceful purposes, ensure the equitable and \r\nefficient use of their resources and the conservation of \r\ntheir living resources and further the study, protection \r\nand preservation of the marine environment, thereby \r\npromoting the economic and social advancement of my \r\nown country and the entire international community.\r\nWith regard to the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of marine biodiversity, Mexico would like to \r\nthank Ms. Rena Lee for the successful holding of the \r\nfirst session of the Intergovernmental Conference on \r\nan international legally binding instrument under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. My \r\ndelegation eagerly awaits the working document that \r\nthe President of the Conference will present to advance \r\nthe negotiations based on a text that will include treaty \r\nlanguage during the Conference’s second session, to be \r\nheld next year.\r\nI would also like to emphasize the international \r\ncommunity’s commitment to the preservation of marine \r\necosystems, as reflected in Aichi Biodiversity Target \r\n11. I am pleased to highlight the fact that more than \r\n22 per cent of Mexico’s marine area is protected, far \r\nexceeding the parameters in Target 11. We nevertheless \r\nremain firmly committed to developing instruments \r\nand coordination mechanisms for creating synergies \r\nwith other relevant actors and achieving even better \r\nresults in this area.\r\nWith regard to marine scientific research, my \r\ndelegation reiterates the importance of ramping up \r\nour capacities and resources to conduct research in \r\naccordance with the provisions of UNCLOS with a \r\nview to achieving a vast and high-quality body of \r\nknowledge on the various problems related to the oceans \r\nand the seas. We urge that the relevant international \r\norganizations improve their cooperation in sharing and \r\ndisseminating information with a view to coordinating \r\nresearch efforts.\r\nMexico condemns the illegal trade in species via \r\nthe oceans and seas and affirms its commitment to \r\npreventing and halting such activities. My country has \r\nalready adopted legislation to counter illicit trafficking \r\nin species in accordance with its international \r\nobligations, and we have criminalized it under our \r\npenal code in order to ensure that we have more \r\ntools available to combat that reprehensible practice \r\neffectively. In accordance with our international \r\nobligations under a number of instruments, such as \r\nthose of UNESCO, the Convention on International \r\nTrade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora \r\nand the Convention on Biological Diversity, we have \r\nramped up our efforts to preserve marine species, \r\nincluding the vaquita porpoise. Mexico has taken a \r\nnumber of steps to halt activities affecting that species, \r\nand we continue to work to find tools that will enable us \r\nto preserve it, in ongoing cooperation with the relevant \r\ninternational organizations.\r\nWe should not fail to mention some of the major \r\nchallenges currently confronting our oceans. Above \r\nall, we must redouble our efforts to address the issue of \r\npollution from land-based sources, especially plastics \r\nand microplastics. We must also confront the negative \r\neffects of anthropogenic underwater noise on marine \r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n20/32 18-42609\r\necosystems. Lastly, we want to once again reiterate how \r\nurgent it is that we deal with the effects of climate change \r\nand ocean acidification on the marine environment and \r\nmarine biodiversity through measures that encourage \r\nStates to improve their scientific activities so as to \r\nhave a better understanding of those effects and find \r\neffective ways to adapt.\r\nThe oceans are our planet’s richest and largest \r\necosystem. They are unquestionably humankind’s most \r\nprecious shared heritage. We hope that we can live up \r\nto the enormous responsibility of caring for them and \r\npreserving them for the sake of future generations.\r\nMs. Alnaser (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, my delegation would like to express its \r\nappreciation for the report of the Secretary-General \r\nunder agenda item 78 entitled “Oceans and the law of \r\nthe sea” (A/73/68), which we have read carefully. It \r\nstresses that the preservation of the seas, the oceans and \r\ntheir resources is crucial to promoting the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, particularly Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 14. It also includes information on \r\nthe latest and most important developments in that \r\nregard, as well as on the United Nations Open-ended \r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of \r\nthe Sеа at its nineteenth meeting (see A/73/124), which \r\ndiscussed the topic of anthropogenic underwater noise.\r\nThe State of Kuwait emphasizes the importance \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea (UNCLOS), which my country has been a party to \r\nsince 1994. We also participated in the amendment of \r\nthe Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI \r\nof UNCLOS and have been a party to the Agreement on \r\nthe Privileges and Immunities of International Tribunal \r\nfor the Law of the Sea since 2002, as well as many other \r\ninternational instruments that govern maritime relations \r\namong States and establish the optimal legal framework \r\nin that area. In addition, my country has participated \r\nin many United Nations meetings and activities related \r\nto the seas and the oceans, as well as in the periodic \r\nmeetings of the International Maritime Organization.\r\nAccordingly, the State of Kuwait calls on all \r\nStates that are not party to UNCLOS to accede to it \r\nand to other relevant instruments, especially given the \r\nimportant role of the Convention in the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and in \r\nstrengthening international peace and security.\r\nMaritime shipping is one of the oldest and most \r\nimportant transport sectors in the world. Threats posed \r\nto it by illegitimate and criminal activities are a source \r\nof major concern to States and the global business \r\ncommunity alike. The promotion of international \r\nand regional efforts to confront threats to maritime \r\nsecurity, including piracy and armed robbery at sea, \r\nrepresents the commitment of Member States to protect \r\ninternational shipping from such threats. My country \r\nfirmly condemns all illegitimate actions and practices \r\nthat threaten the safety of maritime navigation.\r\nThe current relatively low incidence of piracy \r\nand armed robbery at sea, after a prolonged period of \r\ncontinuous attacks, is a positive indication of growing \r\nstability, especially in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. \r\nOnly two attacks were reported this year off the Somali \r\ncoast. This drop in the number of attacks compared to \r\nprevious years is the result of outcomes agreed on in \r\nJuly by the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of \r\nSomalia and the implementation of its broad mandate, \r\nwhich have actively contributed to reducing the attacks \r\nand the threat that they pose to international peace and \r\nsecurity at sea.\r\nMr. Islam (Bangladesh): Bangladesh joins other \r\ndelegations in thanking the coordinators of the two \r\ndraft resolutions (A/73/L.35 and A/73/L.41) under \r\nagenda item 78 for their excellent work.\r\nHealthy oceans are critical to sustaining life, \r\neliminating poverty and promoting prosperity on the \r\nplanet. Thanks to the peaceful settlement in 2014 of \r\nmaritime border disputes with its neighbours Myanmar \r\nand India, the Government of Bangladesh has embarked \r\non a path to unlocking the potential of better access \r\nto sea and ocean resources. The blue economy is now \r\nconsidered a new development space in Bangladesh. \r\nShipping, seaports, shipbuilding, ship recycling, \r\nmarine fisheries, production of sea salt, coastal tourism, \r\nocean energy, land reclamation, maritime safety and \r\nsurveillance and human resources development and \r\ngovernance have been identified as key priority areas \r\nfor the development of the blue economy. Those issues \r\nhave been addressed in our Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, \r\nrecently established under the visionary leadership \r\nof our Prime Minister. We will touch on a number of \r\nissues from our national point of view.\r\nFirst, we recall the outcome of the United Nations \r\nOcean Conference, which identified ways and means \r\nto implement Sustainable Development Goal 14 of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Of the 10 \r\ntargets under Goal 14, six are time-specific and require \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 21/32\r\nrobust and sustained global partnerships to facilitate \r\ntheir implementation. In that regard, we stress the \r\nimportance of completing the World Trade Organization \r\nnegotiations to address fisheries subsidies that could \r\ncontribute directly or indirectly to overcapacity and \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nSecondly, it is evident from research that \r\nclimate-induced sea-level rise may have severe \r\nsocioeconomic and environmental impacts on coastal \r\nStates, including their maritime boundary delimitation. \r\nWe thank the International Law Commission for its \r\nrecent decision to include the issue of sea-level rise in \r\nrelation to international law in its long-term programme \r\nof work.\r\nThirdly, we remain particularly concerned about \r\nlarge movements of refugees and migrants at sea, \r\nmostly in perilous situations. We urge States to \r\ncomply with their search-and-rescue obligations at \r\nsea and to work to address the push and pull factors \r\nunderlying such irregular movements. With regard to \r\nthe continuing aftermath of the Rohingya humanitarian \r\ncrisis in Rakhine state that began in August 2017, we \r\nwant to draw the attention of all the countries of the \r\nregion concerned to the need to strengthen maritime \r\nsurveillance and interception in coastal areas. We take \r\nfull note of the Secretary-General’s observation in that \r\nregard in his report on oceans and the law of the sea \r\n(see A/73/368, paras. 37-42).\r\nFourthly, we urge the Commission on the Limits \r\nof the Continental Shelf to expedite its work in order \r\nto enable it to dispose of its pending submissions. \r\nBangladesh submitted its claims on the continental \r\nshelf in 2011 and later deposited updated baseline \r\ninformation with the Division for Ocean Affairs and \r\nthe Law of the Sea pursuant to the relevant provision of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS). We appreciate the amendment of the terms \r\nof reference of the trust fund created for facilitating \r\nthe preparation of submissions to the Commission by \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nFifthly, we welcome the holding of the first session \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations to discuss and \r\nexplore ways and means to reach our goal to elaborate, \r\nadopt and implement an international legally binding \r\ninstrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction. We look forward to \r\ncommencing work on text-based negotiations to bring \r\nour work dating back to 2006 to its logical conclusion. \r\nWe thank the Nippon Foundation and the Division for \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for organizing \r\ntraining for representatives of developing countries.\r\nFinally, capacity-building and the transfer of marine \r\ntechnology are of the utmost importance for developing \r\nStates, in particular the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs). Among other issues, we draw the attention of \r\nour development partners to the appropriate utilization \r\nfor that purpose of the United Nations Technology \r\nBank for LDCs.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to reiterate our \r\ncommitment to UNCLOS as the constitution of the \r\noceans, establishing the overarching legal framework \r\nwithin which all activities in the oceans and seas should \r\nbe carried out. We urge all remaining States that have \r\nnot yet done so to join the Convention in order to help \r\nachieve its universality.\r\nMr. Umasankar (India): In many ways, the oceans \r\nsupport life on Earth. We rely on them for food, energy, \r\nnavigation purposes and employment opportunities. \r\nThe oceans are interconnected and must be considered \r\nas a whole. The emergence of ocean governance \r\nassumes that the challenges of the ocean space are \r\nclosely interrelated and requires all nations to cooperate \r\nin the management of the oceans. Since its adoption, \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS) and the affiliated institutions governing the \r\nlaw of the sea have played a pivotal role in ensuring \r\nthe harmonious and judicious use of ocean resources \r\nfor humankind.\r\nThe International Seabed Authority, the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \r\nestablished under the Convention are key to the proper \r\nimplementation of the Convention’s provisions and to \r\nthe realization of the benefits we want from the use of \r\nthe oceans and seas. At the same time, we note that \r\nour understanding of the oceans and their wide-ranging \r\neffects on life, as well as the impact of human activities \r\non the oceans, are constantly evolving owing to \r\nscientific and technical advances. Today we have access \r\nto some of the deepest parts of the oceans. We thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/73/368) on oceans \r\nand the law of the sea, and other related issues.\r\nStates look to ocean resources as a means of \r\nfostering economic growth and social advancement, \r\nand the development of an ocean-based economy \r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n22/32 18-42609\r\nis attracting increased attention. Over the past two \r\ndecades of its operation, the Convention has made a \r\nsignificant contribution to the sustainable development \r\nof the oceans and seas and to the promotion of the \r\neconomic and social advancement of all countries of \r\nthe world. In that regard, we commend the Group of \r\nExperts of the Regular Process for preparing the draft \r\noutline of the second world ocean assessment as a single \r\ncomprehensive assessment, in accordance with the \r\nrecommendations adopted in August by the eleventh Ad \r\nHoc Working Group of the Whole and endorsed by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We also welcome the timetable and \r\nimplementation plan prepared by the Group of Experts.\r\nThe nineteenth meeting of the Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea \r\nin June provided a unique forum for comprehensive \r\ndiscussions on anthropogenic underwater noise, \r\nfacilitating an exchange of views among multiple \r\nstakeholders and improving coordination and \r\ncooperation among States and the competent agencies. \r\nWe welcome the report (see A/73/373) on the work \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group of the Whole on the \r\nRegular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment \r\nof the State of the Marine Environment, including \r\nSocioeconomic Aspects of the Group. We support the \r\ncontinuation of that process.\r\nWhile the 1982 United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea, which was adopted following decades-\r\nlong negotiations, lays down the basic framework for \r\ninternational law governing the jurisdiction of coastal \r\nStates over adjacent maritime areas, the governance of \r\nareas beyond such jurisdiction is becoming increasingly \r\nimportant, especially in view of the rapid advancements \r\nin technology and scientific understanding. In that \r\nregard, we acknowledge the convening of the first \r\nsession of the Intergovernmental Conference on an \r\ninternational legally binding instrument under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction \r\nconvened pursuant to resolution 72/249. We take note \r\nof the substantive discussions that addressed the topics \r\nidentified in the package agreed in 2011 and note that \r\nthe President of the Conference will produce a paper \r\nas part of the preparations for the second session of the \r\nconference. The Intergovernmental Conference is an \r\nimportant process that is expected to give shape to the \r\nglobal governance of an aspect that is of importance \r\nto everyone.\r\nAs a country with a vast coastline of more than \r\n7,500 kilometres, which is home to one third of its \r\npopulation, and with more than 1,000 islands, India \r\nhas a long-standing maritime tradition and an abiding \r\ninterest in ocean affairs. India is the world’s third-\r\nlargest producer of fish and second-largest producer of \r\nfreshwater fish. We have 12 major ports and about 150 \r\nsmaller ones. We are acutely aware of the challenges and \r\nopportunities that oceans represent, from sustainable \r\nfisheries to the prevention and control of marine \r\nlitter and plastic pollution, from affordable renewable \r\nenergy to ecotourism, and as early-warning systems \r\nfor disaster risk reduction and management that build \r\nresilience and adaptation to climate change.\r\nThe need for greening the ocean economy is also \r\nincreasing in importance. We must work to develop \r\ninnovative technologies for offshore renewable \r\nenergy, aquaculture, deep-seabed mining and marine \r\ntechnology, which provide new jobs. India is concerned \r\nabout illegal fishing practices and crimes relating to \r\nmaritime safety and security, including acts of piracy \r\nand armed robbery at sea. We are happy to actively \r\nengage with the work of the Contact Group on Piracy \r\noff the Coast of Somalia, which has contributed \r\nsignificantly to controlling piracy in the Western \r\nIndian Ocean.\r\nWe seek a future for the Indian Ocean that lives \r\nup to the theme of “Security and growth for all in the \r\nregion”. That vision was outlined by Prime Minister \r\nModi during his visit to Mauritius in 2015. The Indian \r\nOcean Rim Association (IORA) is playing an important \r\nrole in the region in promoting the importance of the \r\nblue economy as a driver of inclusive and sustainable \r\ngrowth and development. India is a founding member \r\nof IORA, whose first summit meeting, organized last \r\nyear, and recent eighteenth meeting of the Council of \r\nMinisters, held in South Africa, further emphasized the \r\nimportance of the ocean economy.\r\nIndia is an active participant in multilateral efforts \r\naimed at developing the collective management of \r\nocean affairs, and was an early party to the 1982 United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In addition \r\nto UNCLOS, India is a party to the Agreement relating \r\nto the Implementation of Part XI of the Convention \r\nof 10 December 1982; the 1995 Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 23/32\r\nStocks; the International Convention for the Prevention \r\nof Pollution from Ships, of 1973, as modified by the \r\nProtocol of 1978; the International Convention for the \r\nControl and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and \r\nSediments of 2004, which protects the seas from invasive \r\naquatic alien species; the 1972 London Convention on \r\nthe Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of \r\nWastes and Other Matter; and other agreements that \r\nregulate various activities of the oceans, especially the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of ocean resources. \r\nWhile the legal regime on the regulation of the oceans \r\nis fairly well developed, the challenges faced in the \r\neffective implementation of UNCLOS obligations and \r\nother related agreements are an important area of focus.\r\nEffective global partnership is essential if we \r\nare to enhance capacity-building, collaboration on \r\ntechnology, financial assistance and greater awareness \r\nand scientific knowledge for the benefit of least \r\ndeveloped countries, developing countries and those \r\nwith special vulnerabilities in order to help them meet \r\ntheir international obligations. India cooperates with its \r\npartners in the region through its membership of the \r\nSouth Asian Seas Action Plan of 1995, which is serviced \r\nby the secretariat of the South Asia Cooperative \r\nEnvironment Programme. The main focus of the South \r\nAsian Seas Action Plan is on integrated coastal-zone \r\nmanagement, oil-spill contingency planning, human \r\nresource development and the environmental effects of \r\nland-based activities.\r\nThe Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation \r\naims to enhance cooperation between India and 14 \r\nPacific islands on issues such as the blue economy, \r\nadaptation and mitigation practices for climate change, \r\ndisaster preparedness and health, and finding practical \r\nsolutions for the nationally determined implementation \r\nof contributions. Last year, on World Oceans Day, \r\nIndia announced the establishment of the India-United \r\nNations Development Partnership Fund, whose first \r\nproject focuses on climate resilience for Pacific island \r\nnations. India has also earmarked $2 million from that \r\nfund for rehabilitation projects following Hurricane \r\nIrma in Antigua and Barbuda and Hurricane Maria \r\nin Dominica.\r\nThree decades ago, India was the first country to \r\nreceive the status of a pioneer investor in the Indian \r\nOcean. Indian scientists today collaborate in research \r\nstations on the Arctic Ocean, studying its links with \r\nthe climate in our own region. Indian hydrographers \r\npartner in capacity-building efforts with our maritime \r\nneighbours. Indian institutions work closely with \r\nregional partners in improving early-warning systems \r\nfor tsunamis and cyclones. Indian naval ships are \r\ndeployed in the delivery of humanitarian assistance and \r\nemergency evacuation, as well as in patrolling sea lanes \r\nagainst pirates. India is firmly committed to protecting \r\nits coastal and marine environment, and attaches \r\nspecial importance to preventing and significantly \r\nreducing marine debris and litter by 2025 through the \r\nglobal action and collective efforts of all stakeholders.\r\nIn that regard, India has launched a massive \r\ncampaign, known as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan or \r\nClean India, to clean up cities and villages and \r\nrejuvenate its rivers. We have also decided to take on \r\nthe challenge of eliminating all single-use plastics by \r\n2022. As a major source of plastic debris comes from \r\nland, those campaigns will immensely contribute \r\nto reducing the f low of plastic into the sea. India is \r\ncommitted to the sustainable development of its blue \r\neconomy partnership in line with the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, including Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 14, pertaining to the conservation \r\nof the oceans. We hope that we can jointly protect \r\nand preserve the oceans in our collective interest of \r\nachieving sustainable development.\r\nMr. Botto (Monaco) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports (A/73/68 and A/73/368) and the \r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for \r\nthe superlative support it provides to Member States in \r\nthe many complex and important processes related to \r\nthe oceans and seas. We also express our sincere thanks \r\nto the facilitators of the draft resolutions on sustainable \r\nfisheries (A/73/L.41) and on the oceans and the law of \r\nthe sea (A/73/L.35), which we are about to adopt today \r\nand of which Monaco is once again a sponsor.\r\nGuided by the vision of His Serene Highness Prince \r\nAlbert II and the conviction that life on Earth depends \r\nlargely on the health of the world’s oceans, we reaffirm \r\nthe Principality of Monaco’s commitment to protecting \r\nthem and to supporting the marine sciences.\r\nUnder the United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea, the protection and preservation of the \r\nmarine environment and the prevention, reduction \r\nand control of pollution are obligations that apply to \r\nall. Plastic pollution is a real global scourge, given the \r\nlarge amount of plastic waste in the ocean and the way \r\nin which microplastics affect the marine environment \r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n24/32 18-42609\r\nand the entire food chain, including humans. Citizen \r\ninvolvement and partnerships among policymakers, \r\nincluding at the local level and in the private sector, \r\nmust be encouraged and developed.\r\nIn Monaco, the selective sorting and banning of \r\nsingle-use plastic bags and plastic utensils have already \r\nbeen in place for several years. At the Our Ocean \r\nConference in Bali, half a million dollars was pledged \r\nin support of the Beyond Plastic Med initiative through \r\nthe Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, which \r\nlaunched it with other partners in 2015.\r\nWe must consider all kinds of pollution, including \r\noil pollutiond. In the context of the Mediterranean, \r\na semi-enclosed sea of modest size, we must be \r\nparticularly vigilant to prevent and respond to any \r\ndisaster. Under the RAMOGE agreement between \r\nFrance, Italy and Monaco, joint anti-pollution training \r\nexercises are regularly conducted to improve the \r\ncoordination and speed of action of all the relevant \r\nactors. The RAMOGEPOL Plan was also activated \r\nduring a recent accident.\r\nWhile 80 per cent of marine pollution comes \r\nfrom land-based sources, some ocean activities also \r\nhave a significant impact on marine life. For example, \r\nanthropogenic underwater noise, which can be \r\ngenerated by commercial shipping, sonar, the use of \r\nseismic airguns, or industrial activities, particularly \r\naffects certain species such as marine mammals, fish \r\nand migratory species. Underwater noise can change \r\ntheir behaviour, interfere with their communication, \r\ndisorient them and cause them stress and physical harm. \r\nIt is also responsible for the unfortunately frequent \r\nstranding of cetaceans. The work of the nineteenth \r\nmeeting of the United Nations Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea \r\nhas been useful in providing more information on that \r\nissue and we hope that it will lead to greater caution and \r\nmeasures to address it.\r\nMy delegation would also like to emphasize that \r\nclimate change and the health of the oceans are directly \r\ninterconnected. A warming of only 1.5°C or 2°C \r\nwould have significant negative effects on the marine \r\nenvironment. The full and speedy implementation \r\nof the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the \r\nadoption of mitigation measures are therefore vital.\r\nSea-level rise, which puts at risk the very survival \r\nof certain populations and the territorial integrity of \r\nsome States, also raises purely legal issues that must \r\nbe addressed, including within the International \r\nLaw Commission.\r\nCoral reefs, which represent 0.2 per cent of the \r\nocean surface, are home to up to 30 per cent of all \r\nknown marine species and provide socioeconomic \r\nbenefits to 500 million people. However, studies show \r\nthat 30 per cent of reefs have already been destroyed and \r\nthat others are threatened all over the world by ocean \r\nacidification and bleaching, both of which are caused \r\nby increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That is \r\nparticularly worrying, since 2018 is the International \r\nYear of the Reef.\r\nThe International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) \r\nGeneral Meeting was held in Monaco from 5 to \r\n7 December. The ICRI, chaired by Australia, Indonesia \r\nand Monaco since July, brings together Governments, \r\ninternational organizations, scientific bodies and \r\nnon-governmental organizations. The ICRI Plan of \r\nAction 2018-2020 aims to understand coral reef trends, \r\nhelp reduce anthropogenic threats and promote effective \r\nand adaptable solutions to improve their protection.\r\nIn the context of that meeting and following the \r\nvisit of His Serene Highness Prince Albert II to Bali in \r\nOctober, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries \r\nof Indonesia and the Scientific Centre of Monaco signed \r\na letter of intent to establish cooperation on studying \r\nthe impact of acidification and marine pollution, using \r\ncorals as indicators. That collaboration also seeks to \r\nidentify, monitor and rehabilitate bleached or damaged \r\ncoral reefs, and to build the capacity of researchers and \r\nexperts in that domain. In addition, I would also like \r\nto mention the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on \r\nClimate Change, which will present a special report \r\non the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate in \r\nMonaco in September 2019.\r\nStrengthening the role of science, which must \r\nguide all political decisions, is Monaco’s other priority \r\nin the area of oceans and the law of the sea. In the \r\ncontext of the International Decade of Ocean Science \r\nfor Sustainable Development 2021-2030, my delegation \r\nwelcomes the theme that has been chosen for the \r\nnext meeting of the informal consultative process, \r\nin June 2019. We welcome the efforts undertaken by \r\nthe Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of \r\nUNESCO, which is coordinating the preparatory phase \r\nof the Decade. The Commission has already identified \r\nseveral challenges, such as the lack of internationally \r\nrecognized methods for estimating the economic \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 25/32\r\nvalue of ocean services, the difficulty of assessing \r\nthe cumulative impacts of climate change and marine \r\npollution, and our lack of knowledge with regard to \r\nmarine biodiversity.\r\nMy delegation would also like to acknowledge the \r\nrole of the International Hydrographic Organization, \r\nas only 5 per cent of the seabed has been mapped. \r\nHydrography must be supported because it benefits \r\nnavigation and the use of marine resources, as well as \r\nthe development and management of coastal areas.\r\nScience will play a crucial role in the implementation \r\nof Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 for the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine resources. \r\nThe same is true of the human sciences. The Institute \r\nfor the Economic Law of the Sea, established in Monaco \r\nin 1985, organizes symposiums and publishes many \r\nworks. Its Yearbook of the Law of the Sea contains both \r\nsubstantive articles and chronicles, updated annually, \r\non legal instruments, facts and events concerning \r\nmaritime affairs and the law of the sea. It is the only \r\nwork of its kind in the French language.\r\nThe Ocean Conference on the implementation of \r\nSDG 14 in 2017 and the Sustainable Blue Economy \r\nConference in November provided opportunities to \r\ndevelop ambitious partnerships and to strengthen \r\ncooperation. We welcome the many activities of the \r\nSpecial Envoy for the Ocean. The establishment of the \r\nnine Communities of Ocean Action and the follow-\r\nup of the voluntary commitments made at the 2017 \r\nConference are essential to guiding our collective \r\naction and keeping all stakeholders engaged.\r\nIn addition to the obligation to preserve the marine \r\nenvironment, on the one hand, and the importance of \r\nscience, on the other, my delegation would also like to \r\nhighlight the need to establish effective and specific \r\npartnerships. Combining those three elements, in 2018, \r\nthe Monaco Explorations scientific campaign focused \r\non the study of certain marine species and coral reef \r\nhealth, the promotion of marine protected areas and \r\nthe fight against pollution and drift nets in Colombia, \r\nHawaii, Norway, Martinique and Australia, under the \r\nmotto “reconciling humankind and the sea”.\r\nMarine protected areas are crucial tools for \r\npreserving biodiversity and the marine environment. In \r\nparticular, they help to protect important environmental \r\nhabitats and potentially endangered or vulnerable \r\nspecies, and to increase resilience to the effects of \r\nclimate change. We should achieve target 14.5 of \r\nSDG 14 by 2020. The establishment of a coherent global \r\nnetwork of ecologically representative, well-connected \r\nand effectively managed marine protected areas is also \r\na way to meet our objectives.\r\nIn addition, I am pleased to report that the third \r\nMeeting of the Signatories to the Memorandum of \r\nUnderstanding on the Conservation of Migratory \r\nSharks, under the auspices of the Convention on the \r\nConservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, \r\nis being held as we speak, from 10 to 14 December, \r\nat the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. Its work, in \r\nparticular on species-specific conservation measures \r\nand the management of the areas where they live, as \r\nwell as cooperation, will undoubtedly be interesting \r\nand productive.\r\nFinally, I cannot conclude without reiterating my \r\ndelegation’s great interest in the process of drafting \r\nan international legally binding instrument under \r\nthe auspices of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity of \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction. The President of \r\nthe Intergovernmental Conference on an international \r\nlegally binding instrument under UNCLOS on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, which \r\nopened in September, can count on the full support of \r\nthe Principality of Monaco in this complex but very \r\nimportant task.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): First, let me thank Singapore and Norway for \r\nleading the negotiations on the two draft resolutions \r\nbefore the General Assembly today, A/73/L.35 and \r\nA/73/L.41.\r\nI will now present an abridged version of the \r\nArgentine Republic’s statement, the full text of which \r\nwill be uploaded to the PaperSmart portal.\r\nAs it does every year, my delegation reiterates that \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\nhas made one of the world’s clearest contributions to \r\nstrengthening peace, security, cooperation and friendly \r\nrelations among nations. The Convention is one of our \r\ninternational instruments with the greatest economic, \r\nstrategic and political impact. The objective of its \r\nnegotiators was to cover all issues relating to the law \r\nof the sea through a single instrument. Accordingly, \r\nits provisions represent a delicate balance of rights and \r\nobligations on the part of States. That balance must be \r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n26/32 18-42609\r\nmaintained, including in addressing new challenges \r\nto the law of the sea through the processes established \r\nwithin the General Assembly.\r\nThe marine biological diversity of areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction is currently one of the most \r\nimportant issues relating to the law of the sea. The \r\nGeneral Assembly decided to initiate a process to \r\nregulate the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nmarine biological diversity of areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction by developing a multilateral agreement \r\nunder the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea. To that end, it has convened an Intergovernmental \r\nConference to be held over four sessions.\r\nThe first session, which took place in September \r\nin a constructive atmosphere, was a positive step that \r\npaved the way for the development of an initial draft of \r\nthe agreement, which will help to advance negotiations \r\nduring the second round, scheduled for 2019. With \r\nregard to that process, my delegation reiterates that \r\ndeveloping a binding instrument on that issue should \r\nnot be an end in itself but rather a means to effectively \r\nregulate the biological diversity of areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction.\r\nArgentina reiterates that the problem of the \r\nillicit trade in endangered species of wild f lora and \r\nfauna, including by sea, requires that States comply \r\nand cooperate with the rules of the Convention on \r\nInternational Trade in Endangered Species of Wild \r\nFauna and Flora in order to suppress such trade.\r\nArgentina also appreciates the ongoing work of \r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf and would like to once again express its concern \r\nabout its conditions of service. Despite the provisional \r\nmeasures, the issues raised, including medical \r\ncoverage, still require a permanent solution. We must \r\nensure that the Commission has adequate resources for \r\nthat and conditions of service commensurate with the \r\nimportance of its work.\r\nArgentina also wishes to reiterate its appreciation \r\nfor the contributions made by the International \r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea to the development \r\nof international law in general, and to the law of the \r\nsea in particular, as well as to the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes.\r\nThe conservation and sustainable use of the oceans \r\nand their resources is a critical issue for my country. \r\nArgentina works constantly to foster knowledge of \r\nthe sea, strengthen fisheries regulations, combat \r\nillegal fishing, eliminate subsidies in order to prevent \r\nillegal fishing and overfishing, rebuild fish stocks and \r\nprotect biodiversity.\r\nOur country is actively working towards the goal \r\nof conserving at least 10 per cent of its coastal and \r\nmarine areas by 2020, in line with our commitment \r\nunder the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand Sustainable Development Goal 14. In order to \r\nprotect and conserve representative marine habitats and \r\necosystems, we have set up a national system of marine \r\nprotected areas. In addition, Law No. 26875 established \r\nthe Namuncurá-Banco Burdwood Marine Protected \r\nArea as the only open-sea marine protected area located \r\nwithin the Argentine exclusive economic zone. Since \r\n2016, a broad intersectoral and participative dialogue \r\nhas sought the necessary consensus for a State policy of \r\nconservation and the prudent use of marine ecosystems.\r\nMarine debris is found in all the world’s seas, at \r\nall latitudes and depths. As a result, the pollution of \r\ncoastal marine ecosystems and their interactions with \r\nbiodiversity are a complex multisectoral problem \r\nwith global economic, social and environmental \r\nimplications. It is critical to ensure that this problem \r\nis addressed within the General Assembly. Part XII \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea is devoted to the protection and preservation of the \r\nmarine environment and includes specific provisions \r\nfor the use of the sea and its resources, as well as for \r\nthe conservation of resources, particularly living ones, \r\nand the preservation of the marine environment. In that \r\ncontext, the Federal Environmental Council adopted a \r\nnational action plan for the conservation of sea turtles \r\nin the Argentine Republic and, within that, a national \r\naction programme to reduce the interaction of sea \r\nturtles with marine debris.\r\nMy country reiterates its concern about the trend \r\nof using General Assembly resolutions to legitimize \r\nefforts by regional fisheries management organizations \r\nto adopt measures that exceed their geographic, \r\nmaterial and individual scope. Argentina objects \r\nto such interpretations of Assembly resolutions, \r\nparticularly with regard to measures whereby those \r\norganizations assume any kind of authority over vessels \r\nf lying the f lags of countries that are not members of \r\nsuch organizations.\r\nFinally, Argentina would like to express its \r\nappreciation to the entire staff of the Division for Ocean \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 27/32\r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea for their professionalism, \r\nseriousness and dedication, as well as the unsolicited \r\nassistance that they provide to Member States. We \r\nreiterate the importance of ensuring that its resources \r\nare adequate to fulfilling its mandate.\r\nMr. Blanchard (Canada) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to thank Ms. Natalie Morris-\r\nSharma and Mr. Andreas Kravik, who ably coordinated \r\nthe informal consultations on the draft resolutions on \r\nthe oceans and the law of the sea (A/73/L.35) and on \r\nsustainable fisheries (A/73/L.41), respectively.\r\nCanada is committed to championing both national \r\nand international efforts regarding the oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea. We are pleased to see that major steps \r\nhave been taken over the past year in addressing the \r\nchallenges facing the oceans.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLet me start by highlighting a few areas where \r\nStates are working together. Here at the United Nations \r\nwe are working hard to reach our common objective \r\nof developing an agreement under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity \r\nof areas beyond national jurisdiction. That is an \r\nexcellent example of the international community \r\nworking together to develop a multilateral tool to \r\nbetter address a truly global set of challenges. We look \r\nforward to continuing those discussions under the able \r\nleadership of Ambassador Rena Lee, the President of \r\nthe Intergovernmental Conference on an international \r\nlegally binding instrument under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity of \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction.\r\nJust a few weeks ago, in November, together \r\nwith Kenya and Japan, Canada was proud to host the \r\nSustainable Blue Economy Conference, held in Nairobi. \r\nIt was the first global conference on this topic, with \r\nmore than 18,000 registered participants from around \r\nthe world joining in. That number, and the incredible \r\nsuccess of the Conference, speaks to the growing global \r\ndesire to build an economy that harnesses the potential \r\nof our oceans, seas, lakes and rivers to improve the lives \r\nof all, particularly people in developing States, women, \r\nyouth and indigenous peoples.\r\nI was in Nairobi for the Conference and saw it with my \r\nown eyes. It was wonderful to see young entrepreneurs \r\nfrom small island States exchanging knowledge and \r\nbest practices with people from countries in Africa, \r\nAsia and the Americas. It brought people from all over \r\nthe world together on the issue of the blue economy, and \r\nit was done in such a positive way because everyone \r\nwas talking about the sustainable use of our oceans for \r\nthe economy. Everybody was focused on what we can \r\ndo with the oceans from an economic point of view, \r\nwhile at the same time being just as concerned about \r\nthe importance of the sustainability of the oceans. All \r\nof us at the United Nations should be proud of that \r\nevent, because it really was multilateralism at its best, \r\nworking to deal with concrete issues that we are all \r\nfacing together.\r\nLet me now turn to the nineteenth meeting of the \r\nUnited Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative \r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, at which we \r\ndiscussed anthropogenic underwater noise. Scientific \r\nevidence continues to show that anthropogenic \r\nunderwater noise can be a stressor for many marine \r\nspecies. Commercial shipping is one of its sources. In \r\naddition to the efforts being undertaken in the Marine \r\nEnvironment Protection Committee of the International \r\nMaritime Organization (IMO), in January Canada \r\nwill be partnering with the IMO to host a technical \r\nworkshop to spur innovation for quiet ship design \r\nin order to reduce noise and ultimately improve the \r\nmarine environment.\r\nAt the regional level, Canada signed the Agreement \r\nto Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the \r\nCentral Arctic Ocean. As an Arctic Ocean coastal State, \r\nwe are proud to have signed that historic, legally binding \r\nagreement and to be serving as its future depositary. \r\nIt is the first time an international agreement of that \r\nmagnitude has been reached before any commercial \r\nfishing has taken place in an area of the high seas. \r\nThe Agreement will also establish a joint programme \r\nof scientific research and monitoring to improve \r\nunderstanding of the area’s ecosystems and determine \r\nwhether fish can be harvested on a sustainable basis.\r\nCanada’s commitment to the oceans has been \r\nreflected in the importance given to ocean issues \r\nduring its Group of Seven (G-7) presidency. Under \r\nour presidency, small island States and African and \r\nSouth-East Asian coastal States joined the G-7 member \r\ncountries to discuss key challenges and common \r\nobjectives. Advancing gender equality, engaging young \r\npeople and promoting innovation have also played an \r\nimportant part in Canada’s G-7 focus on the oceans. \r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n28/32 18-42609\r\nOne noteworthy result of our conversations is the \r\nCharlevoix Blueprint for Healthy Oceans, Seas and \r\nResilient Coastal Communities. It includes the Ocean \r\nPlastics Charter, which speaks to our common resolve \r\nto eradicate plastic pollution, a significant threat to our \r\noceans.\r\nI want all who are taking notes today and listening to \r\nme to give me their attention for 10 seconds. If they take \r\nonly one thing back to their capitals from my statement, \r\nit is to ask their countries to sign and adhere to the \r\nOcean Plastics Charter, as many countries have already \r\ndone. I encourage them to do because it represents a \r\ncommitment by Member States to genuinely abiding by \r\nprinciples regarding plastics in our oceans, and it is by \r\nshowing that kind of commitment that together, through \r\nour multilateralism, we can influence the behaviour of \r\nour peoples worldwide and actually take the plastic out \r\nof our oceans. It is very important, so if there is only \r\none thing to remember from my statement, that is it. \r\nI ask people to go back to their capitals and ask them \r\nto consider joining the Ocean Plastics Charter, which \r\nbenefits the entire world. Some island States, such as \r\nthe Marshall Islands, recently signed up to it, as have \r\nmany other countries in the past few weeks.\r\nLet me briefly touch on two domestic initiatives \r\nto address ocean challenges in Canada. With regard to \r\nmarine conservation targets, Canada continues to make \r\nsteady progress towards achieving its commitment of \r\nconserving 10 per cent of its marine and coastal areas \r\nby 2020, as agreed at the international level. Canada \r\nhas also exceeded its self-imposed 5 per cent target for \r\n2017. Considering that Canada has the world’s longest \r\ncoastline, that is no small endeavour. More importantly, \r\nwe have learned many vital lessons along the way, \r\nwhich we hope can help the efforts of others.\r\nCanada is also implementing an ocean protection \r\nplan, designed to improve marine safety and responsible \r\nshipping, protect our marine environment and offer new \r\npossibilities for indigenous and coastal communities. \r\nAnd we have introduced a whale initiative, which \r\nincludes substantive measures to protect endangered \r\nwhale species such as the southern resident killer \r\nwhale, a vital component of the local marine ecosystem \r\noff the British Columbia coast.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nDespite all the progress that has been made at the \r\ninternational level and in Canada, there is still work \r\nto be done to overcome the complex challenges facing \r\nour oceans, some of which are the result of climate \r\nchange. No one country has all the answers, and we \r\nfirmly believe that only by working together will we \r\nsucceed in finding solutions. Canada can be relied \r\non as an active partner in collaborating to deliver \r\nmeaningful results on oceans with a view to building \r\na peaceful, more inclusive and more prosperous world, \r\nwhile Canada’s candidacy for a non-permanent seat on \r\nthe Security Council for a term from 2021 to 2022 is \r\nanother demonstration of our commitment to working \r\nto achieve those objectives together.\r\nMr. Fernández de Soto Valderrama (Colombia) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): The Colombian delegation would \r\nlike to express sincere thanks to Ms. Natalie Morris-\r\nSharma of Singapore and Mr. Andreas Motzfeldt Kravik \r\nof Norway for their exemplary work as facilitators \r\nfor the draft resolutions on oceans and the law of the \r\nsea (A/73/L.35) and sustainable fishing (A/73/L.41), \r\nrespectively. Since they took on that role they have led \r\nthe discussions with dignity and transparency and in a \r\nconstructive spirit that is reflected in the texts we have \r\nbefore us today.\r\nColombia is a nation with coastlines on the Atlantic \r\nand Pacific Oceans whose biological and geographical \r\nconditions make for broadly diverse marine and coastal \r\necosystems. The health of those ecosystems depends not \r\nonly on consistent and responsible national management, \r\nbut also on the way that other countries that have an \r\neffect on the oceans conduct their own management. As \r\na very diverse country, Colombia is committed to the \r\nconservation, protection and sustainable development \r\nof those ecosystems through the implementation of \r\npolicies, plans and programmes that attest to the issue’s \r\nnational, regional and global importance. In addition, \r\nwe have major institutions for marine and coastal issues, \r\nguided by a comprehensive vision in which the sea, the \r\ncoast and their resources constitute essential elements \r\nof our actions. My delegation therefore reaffirms \r\nits commitment to the development and sustainable \r\nmanagement of its fisheries resources in order to build \r\nnot only a sustainable country but also sustainable \r\nfisheries at the global level, thereby guaranteeing \r\naccess to fishing resources for future generations.\r\nIt is in keeping with that commitment that Colombia \r\nrecognizes the valuable contribution represented by the \r\ndraft resolutions on the oceans and the law of the sea \r\nand sustainable fisheries. However, we note that they \r\nboth contain wording that the Colombian Government \r\ndoes not share with regard to the 1982 United Nations \r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 29/32\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), such as \r\nthe opinion that the Convention is the sole normative \r\nframework for regulating activities carried out in \r\nthe oceans.\r\nColombia conducts its activities in the marine \r\nenvironment in strict compliance with the various \r\ninternational commitments that it has expressly adopted \r\nor accepted, and takes this opportunity to reiterate that \r\nit has not ratified UNCLOS, which is why none of its \r\nprovisions, except those that Colombia has expressly \r\naccepted, are enforceable or opposable. Colombia \r\ntherefore understands that today’s draft resolution and \r\nour participation in its adoption process cannot be \r\nconsidered or interpreted in a manner that implies the \r\nexpress or tacit acceptance by the Colombian State of \r\nthe provisions contained in UNCLOS. The constructive \r\nspirit that guides our country on the issues of oceans \r\nand the law of the sea is based on the firm belief that \r\nall nations have a commitment to the protection of the \r\nsea and its resources and that the sustainable future \r\nof the world largely depends on that fact. Colombia is \r\nprepared to work in cooperation with other nations to \r\nconfront the challenges of maintaining the health of \r\nthe oceans. For those reasons, Colombia expresses its \r\nreservations about any mention of the Convention in \r\nthe relevant draft resolution, and reiterates that it does \r\nnot consider itself bound by its content.\r\nMr. Kpayedo (Togo) (spoke in French): Togo \r\nnotes and welcomes the high quality of the various \r\nsubstantive reports (A/73/68 and A/73/368) submitted \r\nto the Assembly by the Secretary-General under \r\nsub-item (a) of agenda item 78, on oceans and the law \r\nof the sea, in accordance with the relevant provisions of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS) and General Assembly resolution 72/73.\r\nAs the report contained in document A/73/368 \r\nrightly emphasizes, the oceans, the lungs of the world \r\nand the providers of most of the Earth’s oxygen, play an \r\nessential role in daily life, as they are critical to many \r\nkey areas such as food security, livelihoods, tourism, \r\ntransport and climate regulation. As a result, coastal \r\ncommunities, particularly in the least developed \r\ncountries and small island States, are highly dependent \r\non them, since the oceans help to eliminate poverty \r\nand contribute to local development, and form the \r\nfoundations of a sustainable marine economy.\r\nTogo, which is party to the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 \r\nand the Agreement relating to the implementation of \r\nPart XI of the Convention, among other instruments, has \r\nalways attached particular importance to ocean issues, \r\nwhich the Government addresses in an integrated, \r\ninterdisciplinary and intersectoral manner in the \r\ncontext of the implementation of the Convention. That \r\nis why, taking into account the challenges related to the \r\npreservation and sustainable use of marine resources \r\nunder its national jurisdiction, my country created \r\nby presidential decree a national authority for State \r\naction at sea, whose mission is to strengthen the action \r\nof public institutions and coordinate all intersectoral \r\nefforts with the aim of preserving Togo’s maritime \r\ninterests. That body includes our High Council for the \r\nSea, an excellent framework that defines the guidelines \r\nfor our country’s maritime policy under the authority \r\nof the President of the Republic and whose strategic \r\ndecisions are implemented by our Maritime Prefecture.\r\nTogo welcomes the successful holding, from \r\n4 to 17 September, of the first session of the \r\nIntergovernmental Conference on an international \r\nlegally binding instrument under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity of \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction. My country, which \r\ntook an active part in the session, intends to maintain \r\nits commitment during the two sessions scheduled for \r\n2019 in order to ensure the development and finalization \r\nof an ambitious instrument in 2020 as the outcome of \r\nthat important process.\r\nWhile already engaged in the first cycle, my \r\ncountry is also committed to the second cycle of the \r\nRegular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment \r\nof the State of the Marine Environment, including \r\nSocioeconomic Aspects. As a result, in May, in response \r\nto the Assembly’s invitation in paragraphs 312 and 315 \r\nof resolution 72/73, Togo, which has a national focal \r\npoint, appointed five experts to the Pool of Experts, \r\nsome of whom participated in the regional workshops \r\nheld in 2018 in Palau and Ghana. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation would like to acknowledge and commend \r\nthe contribution of the Division for Ocean Affairs and \r\nthe Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs during \r\nthose and many other ongoing processes, as well as its \r\nmultifaceted assistance to Member States, especially in \r\nthe area of capacity-building in the organization and \r\nmanagement of various fellowships that have benefited \r\nseveral officials from our national Administration.\r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n30/32 18-42609\r\nTogo would also like to take this opportunity \r\nduring the consideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item \r\n78 to commend and support the International Seabed \r\nAuthority and the International Tribunal for the Law \r\nof the Sea for the work they have accomplished within \r\ntheir respective mandates.\r\nBelieving as we do that the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of our oceans, seas and marine \r\nresources are crucial to sustainable development, \r\nTogo sponsored this year’s draft resolution on the \r\noceans and the law of the sea (A/73/L.35), which has \r\njust been eloquently introduced by the representative \r\nof Singapore, and as in the past, will naturally vote \r\nin favour of it. In particular, we welcome the draft’s \r\ncontinued inclusion of paragraph 120, in which the \r\nGeneral Assembly welcomes the adoption in Lomé, on \r\n15 October 2016, of the Charter on Maritime Security \r\nand Safety and Development in Africa by the African \r\nUnion’s Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment on Maritime Security and Safety and \r\nDevelopment in Africa. Togo has ratified the Charter \r\nand invites the other member States in our region to \r\naccede to this important legal instrument, whose entry \r\ninto force within a reasonable time frame will enable \r\nthe African continent, among other things, to prevent \r\nand punish national and transnational crime, including \r\npiracy, armed robbery against ships, the smuggling \r\nof migrants, trafficking in persons and related illegal \r\ntrafficking of all kinds at sea.\r\nIn addition, on 21 September, in accordance with \r\npart VI, article 76, paragraph 8 of UNCLOS, Togo \r\nand Benin submitted to the Secretary-General a joint \r\nrequest to extend their respective continental shelves \r\nbeyond 200 nautical miles. In that regard, my delegation \r\nis pleased to note that the draft resolution for the \r\nseventy-third session now provides that coastal States, \r\nespecially developing ones, can request financial and \r\ntechnical assistance from the trust fund in the context \r\nof the submission of new or revised requests, and \r\nwelcomes the improvement whereby the draft resolution \r\nmakes it possible for members of the Commission on \r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf to join the United \r\nNations health insurance plan on an exceptional basis.\r\nIn conclusion, my country continues to believe that \r\nthe implementation of the Convention is essential to the \r\nsustainable and peaceful development of the oceans and \r\ntheir resources, as well as for meeting the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals set out in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, particularly Goal 14, whose \r\neventual achievement will help to end poverty and \r\nensure sustained economic growth and food security \r\nwhile creating sustainable livelihoods and decent jobs.\r\nMrs. Horbachova (Ukraine): The delegation of \r\nUkraine aligns itself with the statement delivered by \r\nthe observer of the European Union. We would also like \r\nto make a statement in our national capacity.\r\nToday Ukraine is pleased to join many others in \r\nsponsoring draft resolutions A/73/L.35 and A/73/L.41, \r\non oceans and the law of the sea and sustainable \r\nfisheries, respectively. We commend the facilitators’ \r\nexemplary leadership throughout the process.\r\nThe marine environment continues to be a matter \r\nof serious concern due to climate change, marine- \r\nand land-based human activities, marine debris, \r\noverfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated \r\nfishing, all of which burden marine ecosystems and \r\nlead to their gradual degradation. It is therefore vital \r\nto ensure that the international community pays more \r\nattention to those problems and takes concrete steps to \r\naddress them. In that regard, we would like to echo the \r\nSecretary-General’s latest report (A/73/368) on oceans \r\nand the law of the sea, which emphasizes that Member \r\nStates must greatly intensify their efforts if we are to \r\nachieve the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 14, \r\nincluding through enhanced international cooperation \r\nand coordination, as well as increased capacity-building \r\nand transfers of technology to developing States. For \r\nsuch efforts to be cohesive, effective and long-lasting, \r\nthey must be undertaken within the context of the legal \r\nframework of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS).\r\nWe acknowledge the need for enhancing ocean \r\ngovernance as a cornerstone in the preservation and \r\nprotection of the marine environment and biodiversity, \r\nas well as in ensuring peaceful relations among \r\nStates. Ukraine is committed to achieving healthy and \r\nproductive oceans and seas so that they can continue \r\nto support sustainable development for the good of \r\nall humankind. We fully respect all of UNCLOS’s \r\nprovisions and are implementing them in good faith. \r\nUnder the Convention, Ukraine has exclusive rights \r\nto the living resources within its territorial sea and \r\nexclusive economic zone. Since 2014, the Russian \r\nFederation has deliberately and blatantly violated \r\nthose rights in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the \r\nKerch Strait.\r\n11/12/2018 A/73/PV.49\r\n18-42609 31/32\r\nThe Convention requires its States parties to use \r\npeaceful means to settle any dispute between them \r\nconcerning its interpretation or application. Consistent \r\nwith Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\narticle 279 of UNCLOS, Ukraine has sought to resolve \r\nits dispute with Russia peacefully. In that connection, \r\nI would like to update the Assembly on the arbitration \r\nproceedings instituted by Ukraine against the Russian \r\nFederation. On 16 September 2016, Ukraine served on \r\nthe Russian Federation a notification and statement \r\nof claim under annex VII to UNCLOS referring to a \r\ndispute concerning coastal State rights in the Black \r\nSea, the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait.\r\nOn 19 February of this year, Ukraine filed a \r\nmemorial through the Permanent Court of Arbitration \r\nwith the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea \r\nestablishing that Russia violated Ukraine’s sovereign \r\nrights in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Kerch \r\nStrait. The memorial asserts that since 2014, Russia \r\nhas unlawfully prevented Ukraine from exercising \r\nits maritime rights, exploited Ukraine’s sovereign \r\nresources for its own ends and usurped Ukraine’s \r\nright to regulate its own maritime areas. Through \r\nthese violations of international law, Russia is stealing \r\nUkraine’s energy and fisheries resources, harming the \r\nlivelihoods of Ukrainian fishermen and blocking traffic \r\nto Ukrainian ports with its illegal bridge over the Kerch \r\nStrait, among other serious violations.\r\nOn 31 August, the Tribunal hearing Ukraine’s \r\ncase against the Russian Federation under the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea published \r\na procedural order determining that it would rule on \r\ncertain jurisdictional objections raised by the Russian \r\nFederation in a preliminary phase of the proceedings. \r\nUkraine does not believe that the Russian Federation’s \r\njurisdictional objections are plausible or that they \r\nwill be accepted by the Court. On 27 November, \r\nUkraine filed its written observations on Russia’s \r\npreliminary objections.\r\nUnfortunately, the reality today is that Russia has \r\ncontinued its unlawful actions in the Black Sea, the \r\nSea of Azov and the Kerch Strait, and has escalated its \r\ndispute with Ukraine. Through its illegal construction \r\nof a bridge across the Strait, Russia violated numerous \r\nprovisions of UNCLOS, including those pertaining to \r\nUkraine’s rights in its territorial sea and to Russia’s \r\nobligations to protect the marine environment and not \r\nto impede transit passage through the Kerch Strait, a \r\nnarrow, busy stretch of water connecting the Black Sea \r\nto the Sea of Azov and to Ukraine’s ports at Mariupol \r\nand Berdyansk. Moreover, since 29 April, Russia has \r\nengaged in a new campaign to interfere with Ukraine’s \r\nrights in the Sea of Azov by stopping vessels in the \r\nKerch Strait and the Sea of Azov. In the relatively short \r\nperiod since then, more than 200 vessels have been \r\ndiscriminatorily stopped by Russia, in violation of its \r\nfundamental obligation under UNCLOS not to hamper \r\nor impede transit passage through an international strait. \r\nThe Russian Federation has not ceased its activities and \r\ninstead has engaged in new and f lagrant violations of \r\nUNCLOS. Just two weeks ago, it attacked, seized and \r\ndetained Ukrainian naval vessels in Ukraine’s exclusive \r\neconomic zone.\r\nOn 27 November, in a letter submitted to the \r\nTribunal, Ukraine described Russia’s ongoing pattern \r\nof harassment against Ukrainian and international \r\nvessels seeking passage through the Kerch Strait \r\nto Mariupol, Berdyansk and other Ukrainian ports. \r\nRussia’s actions actively closed the Kerch Strait to all \r\nvessels, resulting in protests not only from Ukraine \r\nbut also from authorities representing other Black Sea \r\nlittoral States. The European Union and Turkey both \r\ninsist on their right to free passage through the Strait. \r\nUkraine believes that Russia must and will be held \r\naccountable for its serious breaches of the international \r\nlaw of the sea.\r\nThe Russian Federation is pursuing a policy of \r\nlegitimizing its attempted annexation of Crimea by \r\nusing various subversive tactics and strategies. One of \r\nthem is through the International Maritime Organization \r\n(IMO). Russia’s claim that it has responsibility for the \r\nimplementation of International Maritime Organization \r\ninstruments in the maritime areas adjacent to the \r\nCrimean peninsula cannot be regarded as constituting a \r\nbasis for a proper implementation of IMO instruments, \r\nand can have no legal consequences. Furthermore, \r\nRussia’s reckless unilateral actions, such as unlawful \r\npractices regarding the certification of seafarers and \r\nthe registration of ships in occupied Crimea, and its \r\nattempts to assert control over Ukraine’s search-and-\r\nrescue assets in the occupied Crimea, have turned the \r\nnorthern part of the Black Sea into a grey zone for \r\ninternational shipping.\r\nUkraine has provided detailed reports on a \r\nsemi-annual basis since 1 January 2017 on threats to \r\nthe safety and security of navigation in the maritime \r\nareas adjacent to the temporarily occupied Autonomous \r\nRepublic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, \r\nA/73/PV.49 11/12/2018\r\n32/32 18-42609\r\nwhich have been circulated by the IMO Secretariat in \r\naccordance with a decision of the Maritime Safety \r\nCommittee. Given the significant uncertainty of the \r\nsituation and its considerable implications for the safety \r\nand security of navigation, Ukraine strongly urges all \r\nStates to ensure that ships entitled to f ly their f lag \r\ntake those reports into account when operating in the \r\nnorthern part of the Black Sea. Ukraine further calls \r\non all States and international organizations to refrain \r\nfrom any action or dealings that might be interpreted \r\nas recognizing the unilateral actions of the Russian \r\nFederation that have precluded Ukraine from carrying \r\nout its international obligations under applicable \r\ntreaties and conventional instruments.\r\nThe ability of States to maximize the benefits of \r\nthe oceans and seas and develop a sustainable ocean-\r\nbased economy depends on maintaining and enhancing \r\nthe security of maritime spaces. We therefore condemn \r\npiracy and armed robbery at sea, transnational \r\norganized crime and terrorism in the maritime domain, \r\ntrafficking in persons, the smuggling of migrants, \r\nand illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and \r\nother maritime activities that threaten global stability, \r\nsecurity and prosperity. In that regard, we strongly \r\nbelieve that a coordinated and integrated approach \r\nto all ocean-related issues at the global, regional and \r\nnational level is imperative.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to express our \r\ngratitude to the Secretariat and to the Division for \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for their work \r\nand constant support throughout the year.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
