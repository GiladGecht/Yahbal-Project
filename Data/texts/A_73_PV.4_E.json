"United Nations A/73/PV.4\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n4th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 24 September 2018, 9.30 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.35 a.m.\r\nHigh-level plenary meeting, to be known as the \r\nNelson Mandela Peace Summit \r\nAgenda item 66\r\nPeacebuilding and sustaining peace\r\nDraft resolution (A/73/L.1)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): This high-\r\nlevel plenary meeting is held in accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 72/243 of 22 December \r\n2017, and takes place under agenda item 66, entitled \r\n“Peacebuilding and sustaining peace”.\r\nI warmly welcome everyone to this high-level \r\nmeeting, which will focus on global peace in honour of \r\nthe centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela.\r\nThe General Assembly has before it a draft \r\nresolution issued as document A/73/L.1, entitled \r\n“Political declaration adopted at the Nelson Mandela \r\nPeace Summit”. Before proceeding further, I would \r\nlike to inform Members that action on the draft \r\npolitical declaration will be taken at the end of this \r\nopening meeting.\r\nI would now like to make a statement.\r\nIt is an honour for me to be here today to celebrate \r\nthe centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela, one of the \r\ngreatest leaders of our time. He was a leader who taught \r\nus that it is possible to forgive and for reconciliation \r\nand peace to prevail over hate and vengeance. I would \r\nlike to acknowledge the presence at today’s meeting \r\nof Dr. Helena Ndume of Namibia, who was one of the \r\nfirst-ever laureates of the Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela \r\nPrize, along with the former President of Portugal Jorge \r\nSampaio, who, regrettably, could not be here with us \r\ntoday. Their efforts to provide inclusive access to health \r\nand education are an inspiration and honour Nelson \r\nMandela’s legacy in today’s world.\r\nToday the extraordinary legacy of Nelson Mandela \r\nis stronger than ever, five years after his death. Mandela \r\nwas always guided by the founding principles of the \r\nUnited Nations. He exemplified the values of peace, \r\nsolidarity, cooperation and respect for all human beings, \r\nregardless of their colour, political views or religious \r\nbeliefs. Mandela himself once said,\r\n“For to be free is not merely to cast off one’s chains, \r\nbut to live in a way that respects and enhances the \r\nfreedom of others”.\r\nI had the privilege of meeting President Mandela in \r\nJohannesburg in 2002 during the Rio+10 United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development. Madiba’s love \r\nfor South Africa shone in his eyes. His profound respect \r\nfor human dignity permeated his interaction with those \r\naround him. Mandela refused to accept the injustices \r\nof his time, and it is for that reason that his legacy \r\nrepresents a beacon of hope for a world still ravaged by \r\nconflict and suffering.\r\nThe threat of the proliferation of chemical and \r\nbiological weapons still looms large. Tensions between \r\nnuclear-weapon States, territorial disputes, ethnic \r\ndivisions and the oppression of minorities persist. This \r\nbleak outlook poses a serious threat to peace and security \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

We are at a \r\npoint where certain principles and values enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations have been called into \r\nquestion. The very principle of multilateralism is being \r\nchallenged. There are fears about our ability to take \r\ncollective action to address the world’s most pressing \r\nissues, such as poverty and hunger, climate change, \r\nconflict and war. A move away from multilateralism \r\nwould jeopardize the future of humankind and of our \r\nplanet. The world needs a social contract based on \r\nshared responsibility, and the only forum we have for \r\nachieving that global compact is the United Nations. \r\nThat is why this year I am calling for us to recommit \r\nto its founding principles and to multilateralism. And \r\nthe General Assembly is the most representative and \r\nlegitimate forum we have for dialogue and reconciliation \r\naimed at building collective peace and security.\r\nThe draft political declaration (A/73/L.1) we \r\nwill adopt today, thanks to the commitment of States \r\nand the wise leadership of South Africa and Ireland, \r\nis a demonstration of the central role played by the \r\nAssembly in achieving global agreements on peace and \r\nsecurity around the world.\r\nThe Nelson Mandela peace declaration represents a \r\nrelaunching of our commitment to peace and a renewal \r\nof States’ willingness to build a peaceful, prosperous, \r\ninclusive and fair world. It calls on us to reflect on the \r\nthousands of victims of conflicts in the world who need \r\nimmediate help from us, the States. The declaration \r\nreaffirms our commitment to the sovereignty and \r\nsovereign equality, territorial integrity and political \r\nindependence of States.\r\nRespect for the sovereignty and self-determination \r\nof peoples represents a starting point for maintaining \r\npeace and harmony among nations. It is clear that we \r\ncan uphold and respect the self-determination and \r\nsovereignty of our countries while also committing \r\nto collective and coordinated action to build more \r\npeaceful, sustainable and resilient societies. As Madiba \r\nknew, there can be no peace if there are still millions \r\nof people without access to quality education, health \r\ncare or decent work, and if there is still hunger and \r\nsuffering. But that requires strong global leadership, \r\nwhich is so well represented in this Hall this morning.\r\nIt is an honour for me to preside over the General \r\nAssembly as we adopt a declaration that will undoubtedly \r\ngive hope to the world and that further reaffirms that \r\nit is only through multilateralism and its clearest \r\nexpression — the United Nations Organization — that \r\nit will be possible to achieve the peace and security \r\nto which we aspire in order to achieve development \r\nand prosperity.\r\nThere are many challenges we face in achieving \r\npeace, and we must ask ourselves how we are going to \r\naddress them. Whether we do it together, or alone and \r\ndivided, the answer is entirely up to us. Personally, I \r\nbelieve that we should always choose to walk together \r\non the path of peace. There is no other option. In \r\nMandela’s words, “It always seems impossible until it \r\nis done.” As a Latin American poet said, “Some people \r\ntranscend death.” Madiba’s gentle, profound gaze and \r\nserene strength, which transformed violence into peace \r\nand aggression into forgiveness, are more alive today \r\nthan ever.\r\nI warmly welcome everyone to this high-\r\nlevel meeting.\r\nI now give the f loor to the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: Nelson Mandela was one \r\nof humankind’s great leaders. He embodied the highest \r\nvalues of the United Nations. He devoted his life to \r\nserving his community — as a lawyer, a prisoner of \r\nconscience, a peacemaker, a president and a respected \r\nelder. He cherished the ideal of a democratic and free \r\nsociety in which all people live together in equality and \r\nharmony. That was a bedrock cause for which he was \r\nprepared to fight and die. He faced his oppressors in \r\ncourt, knowing they had the power of life and death, \r\nand he refused to back down. As a political prisoner, \r\nhe steadfastly refused to allow his dignity to be \r\nundermined, and he became a rallying point for a global \r\nmovement that led to the dismantling of the apartheid \r\nregime. The role played by the United Nations is a \r\nmilestone in our proud history.\r\nAs President of South Africa, Madiba championed \r\nwomen’s rights and South Africa’s landmark 1996 \r\nConstitution, which remains a beacon for human rights \r\nand equal opportunity. Under his leadership, South \r\nAfrica expanded access to health care, education, \r\nhousing, water, sanitation and electricity. Beyond South \r\nAfrica’s borders, Madiba was a profound influence for \r\npeace and democracy. In Burundi, for example, he \r\nplayed a key role in brokering the Arusha Agreement \r\nfor Peace and Reconciliation, and everywhere he was a \r\nchampion for peace, forgiveness, humility, compassion, \r\ndignity and human rights.\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.4\r\n18-29593 3/10\r\nThis year we mark the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Almost \r\nexactly 20 years ago, Nelson Mandela spoke about \r\nthat landmark document in this Hall (see A/53/PV.7). \r\nHe urged all leaders to have the courage to ensure that \r\neventually we can build a human world consistent with \r\nthe provisions of that historic Declaration. Those were \r\nthe words of Nelson Mandela. Today, with human rights \r\nunder growing pressure around the world, we would \r\nbe well served by reflecting on the example of this \r\noutstanding man. We must face the forces that threaten \r\nus with the wisdom, courage and fortitude that Nelson \r\nMandela embodied. That is the only way to build \r\nthe just, peaceful and prosperous world envisioned \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nMadiba was a global citizen whose legacy must \r\ncontinue to guide us. To honour that legacy, the \r\nGovernment of South Africa has generously donated \r\na statue of Madiba that I was honoured to unveil this \r\nmorning. In 2015, the United Nations also decided to \r\naward the Nelson Mandela Prize every five years to two \r\nindividuals who have made significant contributions \r\nto the service of humankind. The first recipients were \r\nNamibian philanthropic eye surgeon Helena Ndume \r\nand my good friend Jorge Sampaio, former President \r\nof Portugal. Each year, we also observe Nelson \r\nMandela International Day by promoting and engaging \r\nin community service. Today we remember a man of \r\ngreat wisdom, quiet dignity and towering achievement \r\nwho worked tirelessly for peace and human dignity for \r\npeople everywhere. That is our Organization’s purpose \r\nand, as leaders, it is our responsibility. Let us commit to \r\nbuilding on Nelson Mandela’s legacy so that all people \r\neverywhere can enjoy peace, prosperity and inclusive \r\nand sustainable development.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his statement.\r\nIn accordance with General Assembly resolution \r\n72/243, I now give the f loor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African \r\nUnion Commission.\r\nMr. Mahamat (African Union) (spoke in French): \r\nThe life, struggle, work and symbolic significance of \r\nNelson Mandela go beyond our imaginings. His life \r\nwas one of unparalleled riches and will remain the \r\nembodiment of fulfilled abundance. Words will never \r\nbe adequate to describe him. As we all know, he shone \r\nhis light in this Hall and in every corner of our planet \r\nwhere the thirst for peace, freedom and equality drained \r\npeople’s spirits and haunted humankind.\r\nIn January 2014, in remembrance of all that and \r\nmany other things, the Summit of Heads of State of the \r\nAfrican Union decided to declare 2014-2024 the Nelson \r\nMandela Decade in Africa. In that regard, in January 2018 \r\nthe thirtieth Summit of Heads of State and Government \r\nagreed to commemorate the centenary of the birth of \r\nNelson Mandela this year. Subsequently, the July 2018 \r\nSummit supported holding the Nelson Mandela Peace \r\nSummit on the margins of the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. In the same spirit, on 22 December \r\n2017, the General Assembly decided to convene a high-\r\nlevel plenary meeting on peace to commemorate the \r\ncentenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela.\r\nThe United Nations and the African Union have once \r\nagain come together with enthusiasm to commemorate \r\nand honour the centenary of the birth of a giant of the \r\nmodern history of Africa and the world, who matured \r\nthrough suffering, hardship and adversity and who \r\ndedicated his wisdom, his courage, his intelligence, his \r\nthought, his ethics, his humanism and all his faith to the \r\nfreedom and dignity of humankind in all their nobility \r\nand morality, not only for the black man but for man \r\nand his place in relation to history and for history in \r\nrelation to man.\r\nToday we are commemorating the centenary of his \r\nbirth. While we mourn his physical loss, we are also \r\nproud to have had him as a supreme symbol of the \r\nAfrican man and an inexhaustible source of inspiration \r\nfor all generations. The true hallmarks of Madiba are \r\nnot only his tenacity, courage and determination, or his \r\nability to transcend human fragilities as he described \r\nthem — egotism, vengefulness and the inability to \r\nforgive — but above all his dedication and commitment \r\nto humanism and the universal. He has gone down \r\nin history, he made history and he has made African \r\nhistory everlasting. At a time when multilateralism is \r\nsuffering attacks from all sides, through selfishness, \r\nintolerance, withdrawal and rejection of those different \r\nfrom us, the commemoration of Madiba’s centenary \r\nresounds in our lives as an intense call for freedom, \r\nsolidarity and peace among humankind.\r\nWhat would he have said today in the light of all \r\nthe challenges and anxieties we are facing? He would \r\ncertainly have told us not to yield to fatalism or to \r\nA/73/PV.4 24/09/2018\r\n4/10 18-29593\r\nabandon our struggle for life. He would certainly not \r\nhave told us to resolve our conflicts with fire and the \r\nsword, nor with hatred, exclusion, repression or the \r\noppression of others. On the contrary, he would have \r\nurged us to redouble our efforts to dare to fight and \r\nto win.\r\nAt this emotionally charged moment in this high-\r\nlevel meeting of the world’s decision-makers, I would \r\nlike to voice the full commitment of the African \r\nUnion and Africa to the universal values that Madiba \r\nembodied, which are his legacy and for which he \r\ngave the best of himself for eternity. Our tribute to an \r\nimmortal icon also sends a vivid message of our esteem \r\nand respect for all the fighters for freedom everywhere \r\nin the world. In that regard, we are pleased to see that \r\nthe heirs of that great man in the rainbow nation that \r\nhe brought forth, South Africa — and beyond it, in \r\nthe rest of Africa and throughout the world — remain \r\npassionately committed to his universal message and \r\nmore determined than ever to carry on his legacy. May \r\nthe Nelson Mandela Peace Summit represent a decisive \r\nstep in establishing genuine peace in the world.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish) I thank \r\nMr. Mahamat for his statement.\r\nIn accordance with decision 72/564 B, of \r\n13 September 2018, I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa, President \r\nof the Republic of South Africa.\r\nPresident Ramaphosa: On behalf of the Mandela \r\nfamily and the people of South Africa, allow me \r\nto express our humble appreciation to the United \r\nNations for convening this special Summit in honour \r\nof the founding President of our democracy, Nelson \r\nRolihlahla Mandela.\r\nIn 1994, during his inaugural address to the General \r\nAssembly, President Mandela said,\r\n“The great challenge of our age to the United \r\nNations is to answer the question ‘Given the \r\ninterdependence of the nations of the world, what is \r\nit that we can and must do to ensure that democracy, \r\npeace and prosperity prevail everywhere?’” (A/49/\r\nPV.14, pp.8-9)\r\nThe signing of the Charter of the United Nations \r\ntook place more than 70 years ago, in a world different \r\nfrom ours today. It was a world still reeling from the \r\nclash of great Powers in the Second World War that cost \r\nthe lives of close to 5 per cent of the world’s population \r\nat the time. It was from that collective trauma that the \r\nUnited Nations was born. Countries sought to reimagine \r\na world where nations would cooperate rather than \r\nclash, and where friendly relations would lead to social \r\nprogress, peace and development and a better life for \r\nall. For those noble ideas to be realized, however, they \r\nneeded to find expression in the actions of those taking \r\nup the mantle of leadership at the most trying of times.\r\nOne such leader was born in the small village of \r\nMvezo, in the eastern part of South Africa, in 1918. \r\nHe would come to represent the hopes of millions of \r\nSouth Africans who dreamed of a life unshackled from \r\na system that limited their potential and stif led their \r\npossibilities based merely on the colour of their skin. \r\nThe story of South Africa’s transition from apartheid \r\nto democracy, and the role played in it by Nelson \r\nMandela, is well known. It is a story of humankind’s \r\ngreat capacity for goodness, peace and hope. It was \r\nalso that capacity that led to the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations, which served as an important platform \r\nfor the anti-apartheid movement and which continues \r\nto be a platform for other struggles against oppression, \r\nwar and global injustice. Since the formation of the \r\nUnited Nations, the world has faced many crises that \r\nhave tested the limits of diplomacy and the multilateral \r\nsystem. Throughout those crises, the United Nations \r\nhas endured as a force for stability, cooperation and the \r\npeaceful resolution of conflict.\r\nWhile much has been done to ensure that the \r\nworld will never go to war against itself again, the \r\nOrganization has nonetheless continued to face more \r\nintricate and complex challenges. Over the past seven \r\ndecades, millions of people worldwide have been \r\nkilled, some maimed and others displaced, and many \r\nhave starved as a result of war and conflicts. Women \r\nand children continue to bear a disproportionate \r\nburden of those troubles. While we have managed to \r\navoid another world war, we have continued to grapple \r\nwith the haunting spectre of modern atrocities such \r\nas the genocides in Rwanda and Srebrenica. We are \r\nconfronting intra-State armed conflicts in Syria, South \r\nSudan and Yemen, protracted turmoil in a number of \r\nparts of Africa and struggles for self-determination \r\nin Western Sahara and Palestine. They show that the \r\ncurrent threats to international peace and security \r\nare more the result of conflicts within States and the \r\neffects that they have across nations that have become \r\nincreasingly interdependent, rather than of traditional \r\nconflicts between States.\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.4\r\n18-29593 5/10\r\nTerrorism, transnational organized crime, illicit \r\nf lows of finance and growing numbers of refugees pose \r\nsignificant threats to global order and peace. No longer \r\ncan we ignore the troubles of those in distant parts of the \r\nworld, or fail to address the root causes of conflicts that \r\nwe often imagine are foreign to us. To respond to those \r\nthreats, we need a United Nations that is responsive, \r\nadaptable and also able to deal with challenges that its \r\nfounders could not have imagined. It should not rely \r\nmerely on the political interests of a few, as an impasse \r\nbetween the major Powers often impedes the entire \r\nOrganization’s ability to act. Instead, we should draw \r\non the strength of the collective in resolving complex \r\nchallenges. The United Nations can succeed only to \r\nthe degree that we, as global leaders, provide visionary \r\nleadership that transcends our ideological differences \r\nand narrow national interests.\r\nThrough this Peace Summit, the current generation \r\nof global leadership has been given a wonderful \r\nopportunity not only to reflect on peace in the world, \r\nbut also to take the measures necessary to end the \r\nwars that continue to take millions of innocent lives. \r\nWe are called on to act decisively to end the exposure \r\nof women and children to untold suffering, including \r\ndisplacement, torture, rape, mutilation and murder. \r\nWe are called on to ensure that women are afforded a \r\nspecial role in peace negotiations, political transitions \r\nand in ensuring durable security for all. We must \r\nbe unanimous in our support for the work of the \r\nSecretary-General and the Executive Director of UN-\r\nWomen in ensuring that women take centre stage on \r\nissues of peace and security and provide leadership in \r\npeace operations. We welcome efforts to achieve the \r\nequal representation of women in leadership positions \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping missions.\r\nIn our search for peace, we dare not ignore the \r\ncontinued existence of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nwhose capacity for human devastation is too dreadful \r\nto contemplate. Twenty years ago almost to the day, \r\nPresident Mandela addressed the General Assembly for \r\nthe last time. He said,\r\n“We must ask the question, which might sound \r\nnaive to those who have elaborated sophisticated \r\narguments to justify their refusal to eliminate \r\nthese terrible and terrifying weapons of mass \r\ndestruction — why do they need them, anyway?” \r\n(A/53/PV.7, p.14)\r\nTo this day, his question has been met with no satisfactory \r\nanswer. The truth is that there can be no justification \r\nfor the existence of weapons that carry with them the \r\npotential to extinguish life on this planet. We therefore \r\napplaud the adoption by the General Assembly last \r\nyear of the groundbreaking Treaty on the Prohibition \r\nof Nuclear Weapons. South Africa will soon deposit its \r\ninstrument of ratification of that historic Treaty. We \r\ncall on all peace-loving States to ratify the Treaty so \r\nthat it comes into force without any delay.\r\nAs we strive for peace, we cannot escape the reality \r\nthat conflict and hostility have their roots in poverty, \r\nexclusion and marginalization. Unless we confront \r\nthe conditions under which the poor of the world live, \r\nwe will not succeed in building a peaceful and stable \r\nworld. It is for that reason that the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development is also very much an agenda \r\nfor peace. The Sustainable Development Goals entail a \r\nset of interdependent objectives whose fulfilment would \r\nbe the ultimate act of conflict prevention. We must \r\nensure that the United Nations — in its form, operation \r\nand orientation — is able to maintain international \r\npeace and security, protect human rights and achieve \r\nsustainable development for all.\r\nToday we are gathered as world leaders, representing \r\nthe hopes of billions for a peaceful, prosperous world. \r\nIt was the desire for such a world that prompted this \r\nPeace Summit, with a view to taking stock of how the \r\nUnited Nations has performed in the pursuit of peace. \r\nIt provides a moment for us as Heads of State and \r\nGovernment to recommit to achieving the social and \r\neconomic development necessary for the prevention of \r\nconflict. It is an opportunity to pledge to one another \r\nand to our peoples our determination to seek peaceful \r\nsolutions to our political differences and to build peace \r\nin those countries emerging from the destruction of \r\nwar, violence and the perpetuation of hate. It is our \r\ndeepest hope that this Summit, in the name of one of \r\nour greatest exemplars of humankind, Nelson Mandela, \r\ncan serve as a new dawn for the United Nations.\r\nWe hope the Summit will give expression to the \r\nSecretary-General’s call for a surge in diplomacy. We \r\nhope we will rediscover the strength of will to save \r\nsuccessive generations from war and to overcome the \r\nhatred of our past and the narrow interests that blind us \r\nto the vision of a common future that is peaceful and \r\nprosperous. We hope we will prove ourselves worthy as \r\nthe bearers of the legacy of Nelson Mandela.\r\nA/73/PV.4 24/09/2018\r\n6/10 18-29593\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the \r\nPresident of South Africa for his statement.\r\nIn accordance with decision 72/564 B, I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Excellency Mr. Leo Varadkar, Taoiseach \r\nand Minister of Defence of Ireland.\r\nMr. Varadkar (Ireland): It is my great honour \r\nto join the General Assembly today as we adopt the \r\ndraft  Nelson Mandela political declaration (A/73/L.1). \r\nIt reminds us that Mandela’s is a living legacy, \r\nentrusted to us so we can be torchbearers for peace and \r\nreconciliation for this and future generations.\r\nSide by side with our great friends from South \r\nAfrica, Ireland was privileged to co-facilitate the work \r\nthat has led to today’s Political Declaration. Together \r\nwith everyone here today, I reaffirm that Ireland will \r\ncontinue to uphold the ideals and values of the United \r\nNations and work with the international community to \r\nachieve the aims that Mandela himself worked for so \r\ntirelessly during his lifetime. In Mandela’s story we \r\nrecognize the struggles and triumphs of one individual \r\nand the challenges and hope for humankind. His fight \r\nfor freedom and dignity for all — irrespective of race, \r\ngender, sexual orientation, colour or creed — spoke \r\nto our vision of a common humanity and proved \r\nthat the seemingly impossible can indeed become \r\na reality. It was reflected in South Africa’s first \r\ndemocratic Constitution, which is a template for new \r\ndemocracies today.\r\nThis year in Ireland we mark 20 years of the \r\nGood Friday Agreement, which after decades of bitter \r\nviolence brought peace to Britain and Ireland, closer \r\ncooperation between north and south and power-\r\nsharing in Northern Ireland — at least most of the time. \r\nThe Northern Ireland peace process was advanced with \r\nthe wisdom and assistance of friends from around the \r\nworld, including President Ramaphosa, and for that we \r\nwill always be grateful. We have witnessed firsthand \r\nthe profound truths that Nelson Mandela showed \r\nthrough his wisdom and through his actions: that violent \r\nconflict is not inevitable and can be ended; that peace is \r\nmade not with one’s friends but with one’s enemies; that \r\nreconciliation is achieved by moving beyond the hurt \r\nand pain of the past towards truth and forgiveness and, \r\nperhaps most profoundly of all, that through justice and \r\nforgiveness we can free the prisoner and free the jailer \r\nas well.\r\nTwenty-eight years ago, just months after he was \r\nreleased from prison, on an occasion etched in my \r\nmemory as a young boy who watched it on television, \r\nNelson Mandela was accorded the special honour of \r\nbeing invited to speak to the Irish Parliament. There \r\nhe inspired us all with his words as he attacked the \r\narrogance of racism and honoured those who dared to \r\ncry freedom. In our native Irish language, we say of \r\ntruly remarkable individuals: Ni bheidh a leithéid ann \r\narís, which means “We will never see his like again”. I \r\ncan think of no better way to describe the uniqueness of \r\nMandela. I believe that his legacy is truly international \r\nand points to a deeper truth. A voice may be silenced \r\nby death, but its message can never be suppressed. It \r\nis heard for all time and rings through the ages, and it \r\nfinds a home in the hearts, minds and values of those \r\nwho follow after.\r\nInspired by the message of Nelson Mandela again, \r\nwe in this Hall should provide a voice for the oppressed \r\naround the world and find shared solutions guided by \r\nshared values, such as our belief in and commitment to \r\nmultilateralism, to the freedom of the individual, free \r\nenterprise, human rights, democracy and the protection \r\nof our planet. We should look to this declaration as \r\nwe face the challenges of the twenty-first century. \r\nRecognizing all that is being done in the area of gender \r\ndiscrimination, we must renew our efforts to further \r\nadvance gender equality around the world, and we must \r\ngive young people a greater say in the decisions that \r\nwill affect them and the future of our planet.\r\nWar and hatred come in many guises, but peace has \r\nthe same face the world over. It is the image of those \r\nwho open their hearts and minds to make the impossible \r\npossible and build a future worth living for.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nMr. Varadkar for his statement.\r\nIn accordance with resolution 72/243, I now give the \r\nf loor to Ms. Graça Machel, co-founder of The Elders.\r\nMs. Machel (The Elders): It is my singular honour \r\nto address this collective home of the human family. \r\nI would like to thank President Espinosa Garcés and \r\nSecretary-General Guterres for calling this special \r\nmeeting to celebrate Nelson Mandela’s life and his \r\nlegacy of peacemaking. I thank the General Assembly \r\nfor this privilege. I stand here not as a diplomat, but as \r\na human rights advocate and concerned citizen of the \r\nworld, so forgive me in advance for the unrestrained \r\nmanner in which I will share my frank thoughts with \r\nthe Assembly today.\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.4\r\n18-29593 7/10\r\nToday’s celebration of the legacy of Nelson \r\nMandela, or Madiba, as he was affectionately known, \r\nprovides an appropriate opportunity to reflect on the \r\nvery raison d’être of the United Nations. In October \r\n1945, the founding members of the United Nations \r\nmade this pledge, first and foremost, in the Preamble to \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations:\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations \r\ndetermined to save succeeding generations from \r\nthe scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has \r\nbrought untold sorrow to mankind, and to reaffirm \r\nfaith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity \r\nand worth of the human person, in the equal rights \r\nof men and women and of nations large and small”.\r\nIt strikes me with gratifying humility that, at this \r\nmoment of reflection, we associate Nelson Mandela \r\nas a reference point to help guide us in fulfilling that \r\nsupreme mandate. Indeed, Madiba’s legacy as a freedom \r\nfighter, peacemaker and statesman speaks to the core \r\nof our greatest aspirations for the United Nations \r\nand for humankind. The purpose of this celebration \r\nof Madiba’s life and his contributions to the world \r\nis twofold — to take inspiration from the values he \r\nembodies and to emulate his unwavering commitment \r\nto freedom, equality, justice and dignity for all.\r\nLet me pause here and bring to mind the legacy \r\nof Kofi Annan, my dear brother and fellow Elder, \r\nwho also embodied the values that the United Nations \r\nholds dear. His moral fortitude and commitment to \r\njustice should also serve as an inspiration to shape the \r\ninternational community into a more stable, peaceful \r\nand equitable one.\r\nThe United Nations finds itself at a moment when it \r\nwould be well served by revisiting and reconnecting to \r\nthe vision of its founders, as well as by taking direction \r\nfrom Madiba’s servant leadership and courage. His \r\nexample of servant leadership reminds us that no \r\nsacrifice is too great to ensure the respect and protection \r\nof one’s people. He deeply believed that there is nothing \r\nmore sacred than safeguarding the rights of all human \r\nbeings — not the preservation of ego, not partisan \r\npolitics and not geopolitical considerations.\r\nAn expert in brinkmanship and a keen strategist, \r\nMadiba spent nearly three decades of his life as a \r\npolitical prisoner, and many years thereafter negotiating \r\nthe complexities of peacemaking and nation-building. \r\nWe seek inspiration from his successful approach. \r\nWhile staying true to his ultimate goal of freedom and \r\nsocial justice, he took the interests of his adversaries \r\ninto consideration. He silenced his ego and took risks. \r\nHe gave value to the principle of give-and-take and \r\nnegotiated in good faith.\r\nThe United Nations was shaped by our collective \r\ndesire to prevent conflict and ensure that never again \r\nwould war engulf nations the world over. Yet more than \r\n70 years later, today’s newsreels are full of conflict-\r\nridden headlines, signalling significant discord within \r\nour international community. Global security has \r\ndeteriorated markedly over recent decades. The number \r\nof armed conflicts has increased, and the protracted \r\nconflicts that have been ravaging our global family \r\nfor decades are particularly worrisome to me. Our \r\ncollective consciousness must reject the lethargy that \r\nhas accustomed us to death and violence as if wars were \r\nlegitimate and somehow impossible to terminate. There \r\nis no justification for the loss of life and suffering in \r\nplaces such as Syria, Yemen, Palestine, Somalia, South \r\nSudan, the Central African Republic and Myanmar, to \r\nmention just a few. That has been going on far too long.\r\nThousands of our children, just like our own \r\nsons and daughters, have been robbed of the joys of \r\nchildhood. Thousands of women, no different from our \r\nown sisters and mothers, have been brutalized by rape as \r\na weapon of war. Thousands of our brothers and sisters \r\nhave been needlessly maimed or killed. Thousands of \r\nfamilies similar to our own have been ripped apart and \r\nleft destitute. It is time to say “enough is enough”.\r\nI appeal to the members of the General Assembly \r\nnot to let this be just another summit of statements. \r\nBold, unprecedented action must follow. As for me, \r\nthe meaning of celebrating Madiba is to work to end \r\nthis senseless violence as a matter of priority and \r\nurgency. I encourage the Assembly to interrogate and \r\ndismantle what is fuelling these conflicts — ego-\r\ndriven decision-makers, rigid political dogmas, greedy \r\nacquisition of resources and the massive arms industry, \r\nto name just a few. It is time for every leader here to \r\ntake responsibility — those who are directly involved in \r\nthe atrocities plaguing our world, those who take sides \r\nand those who sit in silence. As the leaders of our time, \r\nthey have a moral imperative, and the ability, to bring \r\nto an end the death and destruction we witness on a \r\ndaily basis. Colombia has proved it can be done. Others \r\ncan follow that example. History will judge those here \r\nshould they stagnate too long in inaction. Humankind \r\nwill hold them accountable should they allow suffering \r\nto continue on our watch.\r\nA/73/PV.4 24/09/2018\r\n8/10 18-29593\r\nI am speaking as a woman who has experienced \r\nfirst-hand the pain and misery of war. In 1996, on behalf \r\nof then-Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, I \r\npublished a report (see A/51/306) on the devastating \r\nimpact of armed conflict on children. My colleagues \r\nand I embarked on two years of research that took us \r\nto conflict settings in every corner of the globe. I was \r\njust a mother then, horrified by stories of frightened \r\nchildren and grief-stricken mothers in refugee and \r\ndisplaced-person camps. Today I am a grandmother, \r\nstill haunted by their eyes and still sitting with a heavy \r\nheart, knowing that the fate of children in conflict \r\nsettings has gotten worse. The voice of a Palestinian \r\nchild still whispers to me, asking “When is this is going \r\nto end?” And I know that that boy, now a young person, \r\nis still in a Palestinian refugee camp.\r\nWe cannot rest until we right these wrongs. And \r\nto do so we must work more collaboratively with \r\nthose beyond this Hall. We therefore actively support \r\nSecretary-General António Guterres in putting peace at \r\nthe top of his agenda. Peacemaking requires more than \r\na political response; it also requires the muscle of the \r\nprivate sector, civil-society organizations and citizens \r\nat the grass roots as well. For example, 25 years ago, \r\nthe African institution ACCORD was established to \r\ncontribute to resolving Africa’s conflicts so as to create \r\nthe conditions necessary for human security, economic \r\nprosperity and social cohesion. Today, after working on \r\nalmost all of Africa’s protracted conflicts, we know that \r\nworking for peace alone will not deliver those goals. \r\nPeace, together with governance and development, is \r\nthe only approach that can ensure stability. In July of \r\nthis year, therefore, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South \r\nAfrica and ACCORD launched a new initiative, Global \r\nPeace, to take ACCORD’s experience from Africa and \r\nthe global South and extend our solidarity across the \r\nworld. Global Peace will make a modest contribution \r\nto transforming how nations drive development and \r\nstability. It will promote an ecosystem of innovators, \r\ninfluencers, investors and the implementers to generate \r\ninnovative solutions to the challenges of our time. \r\nThis civil-society initiative will complement the \r\nefforts of Governments and multilateral agencies and \r\nstrengthen multilateralism.\r\nWhen Madiba founded The Elders in 2007, he gave \r\nus a specific mandate: \r\n“To support courage where there is fear; to force \r\nagreement where there is conflict; and to inspire \r\nhope where there is despair”. \r\nWe Elders spent the past year leading up to Madiba’s \r\nhundredth birthday identifying and showcasing 100 \r\ninspirational civil-society organizations of all sizes \r\nand from every part of the world. Each of those 100 \r\norganizations represents one of 100 ideas for a freer, \r\nfairer world. They work with a commitment to finding \r\nwhat unites their communities, and through collective \r\nefforts they are achieving peace, justice, health and \r\nequality in their communities. On behalf of The Elders, \r\nI have the honour to present to the General Assembly \r\nan inspiring publication featuring these “Sparks of \r\nHope”, which I will hand to President Espinosa Garcés \r\nand Secretary-General Guterres when I conclude \r\nmy remarks. This compendium highlights the moral \r\ncourage and leadership of change agents across the \r\nworld, and I hope members will take inspiration from \r\ntheir work to accelerate social transformation.\r\nIn conclusion, I challenge the Assembly with \r\nMadiba’s words: “It is in your hands to make a better \r\nworld for all who live in it”. It is therefore incumbent \r\non us to live up to the cherished Charter of the United \r\nNations, which asks us to\r\n“save succeeding generations from the scourge of \r\nwar and untold sorrow to mankind and to reaffirm \r\nfaith in fundamental human rights and the dignity \r\nand worth of the human person, in the equal rights \r\nof men and women and of nations large and small”. \r\nAnd I quote Madiba again: “It is in your hands”.\r\nThe President: I thank Ms. Machel for her \r\nstatement and for the 100 “Sparks of Hope”.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nIn accordance with General Assembly resolution \r\n72/243, I now give the f loor to Mr. Kumi Naidoo, \r\nSecretary General of Amnesty International.\r\nMr. Naidoo (Amnesty International): We welcome \r\nthe broad sentiments in the draft political declaration \r\nthat Governments have agreed on for the Mandela \r\nPeace Summit. But the truth is that we have heard \r\nthem before. These are the words that get repeated \r\ntime and time again without the political will, urgency, \r\ndetermination or courage needed to make them a reality \r\nand to make them really count. But we must make them \r\ncount — not tomorrow, but right now, because we are \r\nfacing multiple crises around the world with people \r\nsuffering on an unimaginable scale. Without action, \r\nwithout strong and principal leadership, I fear for them \r\nand for all of us.\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.4\r\n18-29593 9/10\r\nLet us remember that Madiba spent the vast \r\nmajority of his life as a civil-society activist. Yet \r\nas we gather here to honour him today, thousands of \r\nactivists and human rights defenders around the world \r\nare imprisoned or have been tortured or killed. They \r\ninclude trade unionists, people from non-governmental \r\norganizations, social movements and religious \r\ncommunities, journalists and those from the field of the \r\narts and culture. In far too many countries, the civic \r\nspace has been shut down and people deprived of their \r\nright to participate actively and freely in public life.\r\nThe Preamble to the founding Charter of the United \r\nNations opens with the words “We the peoples”, not “we \r\nMember States”. That is why we, the people, should \r\nnever allow ourselves to accept injustice. As Martin \r\nLuther King once said,\r\n“I never intend to adjust myself to racial segregation \r\nand discrimination. I never intend to adjust myself \r\nto religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself \r\nto economic conditions that will take necessities \r\nfrom the many to give luxuries to the few when \r\nmillions of God’s children are smothering in an \r\nairtight cage of poverty in aff luent societies.”\r\nI appeal to the General Assembly today, with the \r\nspirit of Madiba surrounding us all, not to adjust to \r\nthe inhumane way that we have been treating millions \r\nof refugees around the world, not to adjust to the \r\nRohingya population living in an open-air prison under \r\na system of apartheid, not to adjust to the Palestinians \r\nin Gaza living under a relentless military blockade that \r\nkeeps them in poverty and misery, not to adjust to the \r\ncenturies-old subjugation of indigenous peoples, not to \r\nadjust to leaders who espouse xenophobic and fascist \r\nnarratives or demean or undermine women. \r\nNeither should we adjust to the bloodbaths we \r\nhave seen in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, South \r\nSudan and elsewhere, especially when most of the \r\npeople shedding the blood are civilians and a large \r\nproportion of them are women and children. We \r\nshould not adjust to the systematic exclusion of people \r\nliving with disabilities or to the continuing struggle \r\nand marginalization of children and young people \r\neverywhere, for humankind must not judge itself by \r\nthe progress of the most powerful but by the welfare \r\nof the most vulnerable. Indeed, we must take care not \r\nonly of the present generation but those of the future as \r\nwell. We should not adjust to the dismal failure of the \r\npowerful to protect civilians in conflicts. In particular, \r\nwe must not adjust to the deadlock that continues to \r\nhaunt the Security Council, whose five permanent \r\nmembers too often use their powers not to prevent \r\nand stop suffering, but to shield themselves and others \r\ncommitting the worst crimes.\r\nWe should not adjust to the disgraceful levels \r\nof impunity we see, and we should insist on full \r\naccountability for gross violations of human rights \r\nand crimes against humanity. On this, the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights and the twentieth anniversary of the Rome \r\nStatute, which gave birth to the International Criminal \r\nCourt, we urge a renewed respect for the painstakingly \r\ndeveloped conventions and norms of the United Nations. \r\nWe call on nations that have not yet done so to join \r\nthe International Criminal Court, particularly three \r\npermanent members of the Security Council — the \r\nUnited States, China and Russia.\r\nWe should not adjust to the continued inaction on \r\naverting catastrophic climate change while thousands \r\nare regularly devastated by extreme weather events from \r\nthe Philippines to Puerto Rico, where we saw more than \r\n3,000 lives lost, making it the biggest natural disaster \r\nin United States history. Neither, for that matter, should \r\nwe adjust to the imminent reality facing small island \r\nStates, whose very existence is under threat. To the one \r\nleader who still denies climate change, we insist that he \r\nstart putting himself on the right side of history.\r\nTo my brothers and sisters I say, the time for bold \r\nand courageous action is now. I know what my fellow \r\nactivists and advocates are facing, but I implore them \r\nnot to give up. Let the words of Madiba inspire and \r\nguide us: “The brave man is not he who does not feel \r\nafraid, but he who conquers that fear”. And to all our \r\npolitical leaders, I want to say that we honour Madiba \r\nby picking up the mantle, honestly and with integrity, \r\nof all the struggles he waged. The draft political \r\ndeclaration (A/73/L.1) to be adopted here today is an \r\nopportunity for renewed commitment in these troubled \r\ntimes. I say, let us think of the most powerless people in \r\nthe world, those who will live or die as a consequence \r\nof our choices — and let us not disappoint them.\r\nThe President: I thank Mr. Naidoo for his statement.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nWe have heard the last speaker for the opening \r\nmeeting of the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit.\r\nA/73/PV.4 24/09/2018\r\n10/10 18-29593\r\nThe Assembly will now turn to draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.1, entitled “Political declaration adopted at the \r\nNelson Mandela Peace Summit”. In the light of the \r\ntime constraints and in order to ensure the expeditious \r\nconduct of proceedings, delegations wishing to make \r\nexplanations of position are kindly encouraged to do \r\nso in their statements to be delivered in the debate and/\r\nor to submit them for circulation as official documents.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.1, entitled “Political declaration \r\nadopted at the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit”. May \r\nI take it that the assembly decides to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.1 was adopted (resolution \r\n73/1).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I would like to \r\nexpress my sincere thanks to His Excellency Mr. Jerry \r\nMatjila, Permanent Representative of South Africa to \r\nthe United Nations, and Her Excellency Ms. Geraldine \r\nByrne Nason, Permanent Representative of Ireland to \r\nthe United Nations, who ably and patiently conducted \r\nthe discussions and complex negotiations in the \r\ninformal consultations on the resolution 73/1. I am sure \r\nthe members of the Assembly join me in expressing our \r\nsincere appreciation to them.\r\nThe meeting rose at 10.40 a.m.\r\n"
