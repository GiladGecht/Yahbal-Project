"United Nations A/73/PV.51\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n51st plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 12 December 2018, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Ten-Pow \r\n(Guyana), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 15\r\nCulture of peace\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/73/391)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/73/L.43, A/73/L.48, \r\nA/73/L.52 and A/73/L.55)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Bangladesh to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.43.\r\nMr. Islam (Bangladesh): I have the honour to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/73/L.43, entitled “Follow-\r\nup to the Declaration and Programme of Action on a \r\nCulture of Peace”.\r\nA culture of peace is an aspiration of all humankind. \r\nPromoting and inculcating a mindset of a culture \r\nof peace is at the core of the creative management \r\nof differences and divisions. A culture of peace can \r\nbecome a credible pathway to sustaining peace.\r\nOver the years, Bangladesh has remained \r\ncommitted to the values and principles enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and worked alongside \r\nthe international community to promote and protect \r\npeace. The Government of Prime Minister Sheikh \r\nHasina remains committed to the issue and underscores \r\nthe importance of a whole-of-society approach in \r\nour national context to promoting a culture of peace. \r\nBeginning in 1999, Bangladesh has facilitated this \r\nseminal resolution for 19 years in a row. Once again, \r\nwe thank delegations for their active participation in the \r\ninformal consultations on the draft resolution this year.\r\nWe take note of the growing interest in addressing \r\na range of pertinent issues through resolutions under \r\nthis agenda item. The recurrent reference to the \r\noriginal resolution in the subsequent resolutions further \r\nconsolidates the commitment of Member States to the \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of \r\nPeace. This year, the draft resolution has the following \r\nsalient additions.\r\nFirst, the draft resolution acknowledges the high-\r\nlevel event of the President of the General Assembly \r\nheld on 5 September on the theme “The culture of \r\npeace: a credible pathway to sustaining peace”. The \r\nevent provided an opportunity for Member States \r\nto deliberate on the interplay and complementarity \r\nbetween those two seminal notions at the United \r\nNations. The President’s summary of the event has been \r\nduly noted, and we believe it can be useful reference \r\nmaterial for our collective work towards a surge in \r\npeace diplomacy.\r\nSecondly, in the spirit of the President’s high-\r\nlevel event, the draft resolution recognizes that efforts \r\ntowards peacebuilding and sustaining peace should \r\ntake into account the promotion of a culture of peace, \r\nand vice versa. It further acknowledges the potential \r\ncontribution of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture to promoting a culture of peace, pursuant \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n18-43387 (E)\r\n*1843387*\r\n \r\nA/73/PV.51 12/12/2018\r\n2/24 18-43387\r\nto resolution 72/276, entitled “Follow-up to the report \r\nof the Secretary-General on peacebuilding and \r\nsustaining peace”. We believe there is scope for further \r\nexploring and streamlining that issue through informed \r\nconsultations in all relevant forums.\r\nThirdly, in further recognition of the contribution \r\nof a culture of peace towards a comprehensive and \r\nbalanced approach to combating terrorism, the draft \r\nresolution contains a reference to resolution 70/254 \r\nof 12 February 2016, on the Secretary-General’s Plan \r\nof Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. It is worth \r\nrecalling that resolution 72/284 on the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Review reaffirms the \r\nenduring relevance of the Declaration and Programme \r\nof Action on a Culture of Peace.\r\nFourthly, the draft resolution encourages Member \r\nStates, United Nations entities, regional and subregional \r\norganizations and relevant actors to consider instituting \r\nmechanisms to involve young people in the promotion \r\nof a culture of peace, tolerance and intercultural \r\nand interreligious dialogue, among other issues. \r\nThat provides an opportunity to further explore the \r\npromotion of a culture of peace in the context of the \r\nongoing discussion on youth, peace and security \r\npursuant to Security Council resolution 2250 (2015).\r\nFifthly, while recognizing the important \r\ncontribution of the relevant United Nations entities in \r\npromoting a culture of peace, the draft resolution makes \r\nparticular reference to the recent work of the United \r\nNations Alliance of Civilizations and its Group of \r\nFriends. This reflects the continued support of Member \r\nStates for the Alliance’s contribution to promoting \r\na culture of peace through the entire spectrum of \r\nits activities.\r\nOn 13 September 2019, we will celebrate the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace. To \r\nthat end, the draft resolution requests the President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-third session to \r\ngive special attention to its appropriate and befitting \r\nobservance by holding the High-level Forum on that \r\ndate next year, which will be an opportunity to renew \r\nour shared commitment to further strengthening the \r\nglobal movement for the culture of peace. We look \r\nforward to working with the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly to make the event a success.\r\nWe sincerely thank those delegations that have \r\nalready sponsored the draft resolution and encourage \r\nothers to follow suit prior to its upcoming adoption \r\nby consensus.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/73/L.48.\r\nMr. Moncada (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the 120 Member States \r\nthat make up the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries \r\n(NAM), the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has the \r\nhonour to introduce draft resolution A/73/L.48, entitled \r\n“International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy \r\nfor Peace”.\r\nMany delegations have brought up the need to \r\ndefend multilateralism at this session of the General \r\nAssembly — during the general debate, in the various \r\ncommittees, at the high-level dialogue in October on the \r\ntheme of “Renewing commitment to multilateralism: \r\nhigh-level dialogue between the Presidents of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council \r\nand the Security Council”, and in the November Security \r\nCouncil debate on strengthening multilateralism and \r\nthe role of the United Nations (see S/PV.8395).\r\nFor its part, NAM has always insisted on the need \r\nto promote, defend and strengthen multilateralism, \r\nespecially given the current international situation. \r\nWe also heed the Secretary-General’s calls to make the \r\nUnited Nations an instrument for increased diplomacy \r\nfor peace, which would help our efforts to make our \r\nOrganization relevant to all. That is why in September \r\nministers discussed the need to defend the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and the purposes and principles of \r\nNAM, and unanimously adopted a political declaration \r\nto initiate consultations with a view to establishing this \r\nimportant international day.\r\nThe Movement thanks all delegations that have \r\nconstructively and actively participated in the process \r\nof negotiating the draft resolution that is before the \r\nAssembly today. The consensus text is the result of \r\ninclusive and transparent informal consultations among \r\nthe States Members of the United Nations, following a \r\nprocess of mutual engagement that took into account the \r\npositions, concerns and aspirations of all delegations.\r\nWe thank all Member States that have decided to \r\nsponsor this important and timely draft resolution. \r\nWe also recognize the Group of African States, the \r\nGroup of Arab States, the Group of Asian and Pacific \r\nStates, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \r\n12/12/2018 A/73/PV.51\r\n18-43387 3/24\r\nthe Caribbean Community, the Group of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation and other friendly delegations \r\nthat expressed their support for this initiative from \r\nits inception.\r\nAs a reaffirmation of its principles and commitment \r\nto strengthening its role as an anti-war and peace-loving \r\nentity, the Movement has decided to submit this draft \r\nresolution under agenda item 15, “Culture of peace”, in \r\nthe belief that it will contribute to our joint efforts for \r\npeace, security, stability, sustainable development and \r\nthe promotion of human rights.\r\nWe, the States members of NAM, are also \r\nconvinced that an approach based on multilateralism \r\nand diplomacy reinforces the three pillars of the \r\nUnited Nations and that the proposed international \r\nday constitutes a means to promote the values of our \r\nOrganization, to strengthen the faith of our peoples \r\nin the principles of our founding Charter, to reaffirm \r\nthe validity of international law and to advance our \r\ncommon goal of achieving lasting peace.\r\nWe affirm our commitment, once the draft \r\nresolution is adopted, to promoting every 24 April — a \r\nhistoric day for our Movement — as the International \r\nDay of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace through \r\neducational activities and raising public awareness. \r\nWe support the Office of the President of the General \r\nAssembly in its preparations for the high-level meeting \r\nto be held on 24 April 2019, with the participation of \r\nthe Secretary-General, to inaugurate the proposed \r\ninternational day. We also take this opportunity to \r\nrespectfully urge all Member States to participate in \r\nthis event at the highest possible level.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to convey the wish of \r\nthe 120 member States of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nand all the sponsors of draft resolution A/73/L.48 that \r\nit be adopted by consensus, taking into account the \r\nimportance that the States Members of the United \r\nNations attach to multilateralism and diplomacy for \r\npeace. In that way we can share our message of unity \r\nand cohesion with the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nthe representative of Uzbekistan to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.52.\r\nMr. Ibragimov (Uzbekistan): Today I have the \r\nhonour to present draft resolution A/73/L.52, entitled \r\n“Enlightenment and religious tolerance.”\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations for their active and \r\nconstructive engagement, and for their valuable \r\ninput during the informal consultations on this \r\ndraft resolution.\r\nLast year, during the general debate of the \r\nAssembly’s seventy-second session, the President \r\nof Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, proposed the \r\nadoption of a draft resolution on education and religious \r\ntolerance (see A/72/PV.5), given the current challenges \r\nin ensuring tolerance among followers of different \r\nfaiths in various parts of the globe.\r\nHis initiative was based on our country’s centuries-\r\nold tradition and positive experience of ensuring the \r\npeaceful coexistence of representatives of various \r\nreligions. In proposing that draft resolution, Uzbekistan \r\nsought to do its part for advancing interconfessional \r\ntolerance and harmony. The draft resolution is fully \r\nin line with the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration \r\non the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of \r\nDiscrimination Based on Religion or Belief and the \r\nrelevant provisions of Assembly resolutions, including \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As \r\nPresident Mirziyoyev has outlined, the main goal of the \r\ndraft resolution is\r\n“to promote universal access to education and \r\neradicate illiteracy and ignorance. It would be \r\ndesigned to promote tolerance and mutual respect, \r\nensure religious freedom, protect the rights of \r\nbelievers and prevent discrimination against them” \r\n(A/72/PV.5, p. 16).\r\nFrom Uzbekistan’s perspective, the draft resolution \r\nis conducive to encouraging States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations and its relevant agencies to continue \r\nexpanding activities in the field of public education, \r\nmaking efforts to improve curricula and focusing on \r\npromoting religious tolerance. The importance of \r\nadopting the draft resolution is also underpinned by \r\nthe need to promote friendly relations and cooperation \r\namong States and to confront radicalism and extremism, \r\nissues of special relevance in today’s world. In \r\nparticular, the dynamic processes of globalization and \r\nthe current profound transformation of the system of \r\ninternational relations challenge the global community \r\nin new ways.\r\nGiven that complex situation, strengthening \r\nmutual respect for cultural diversity and advancing \r\nA/73/PV.51 12/12/2018\r\n4/24 18-43387\r\ntolerance among people and representatives of different \r\nconfessions are of vital importance and have an enormous \r\neffect on Member States. The draft resolution therefore \r\nseeks to protect freedom of thought, conscience and \r\nreligion by teaching mutual understanding, tolerance, \r\nnon-discrimination and respect in all matters relating \r\nto freedom of religion by promoting, in society at large, \r\na broader understanding of the diversity of religions \r\nand beliefs and of the history, traditions, languages and \r\ncultures of the various religious groups.\r\nIt should be noted that the draft resolution \r\nspecifically calls for promoting education while taking \r\ninto account two important circumstances. First, the \r\nlack of access to quality education in today’s world \r\noften leads to the radicalization of certain segments \r\nof society, especially among young people. Only by \r\nfostering education and encouraging the desire for \r\nknowledge and self-improvement among young people \r\ncan we ensure prosperity and tolerance in our society. \r\nIn that regard, the draft resolution underlines the \r\nkey role of UNESCO in contributing to world peace \r\nby promoting collaboration among nations through \r\neducation, science and culture.\r\nSecondly, in the contemporary world, a \r\nlarge-scale public awareness campaign for rejecting all \r\nmanifestations of religious extremism acquires special \r\nsignificance. The draft resolution therefore highlights \r\nthe valuable role of the United Nations Alliance of \r\nCivilizations in contributing to a more peaceful, socially \r\ninclusive world by promoting greater understanding \r\nand respect among civilizations, cultures, religions \r\nand beliefs.\r\nIn conclusion, given the importance of ensuring \r\ninterreligious tolerance and education for all, it is my \r\ncountry’s sincere hope that the draft resolution will \r\nenjoy the unanimous support of all States Members of \r\nthe United Nations, which I also encourage to become \r\nits sponsors. Uzbekistan, for its part, stands ready \r\nto cooperate closely with all Member States in the \r\npractical implementation of the draft resolution, which \r\nwill contribute to ensuring interreligious harmony and \r\nadvancing education, as well as reaching the targets of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.55.\r\nMr. Munir (Pakistan): I have the honour to present \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.55, entitled “Promotion of \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding \r\nand cooperation for peace”.\r\nSince 2004, Pakistan, together with the Philippines, \r\nhas been a proud facilitator of this annual resolution. \r\nAdopted by consensus by the General Assembly, it \r\nhas evolved over the years into a significant document \r\nfor promoting genuine and constructive dialogue \r\nacross the cultural and religious divide. Introduced \r\nunder the item “Culture of peace”, in many ways it \r\nsymbolizes the timeless aspirations behind the creation \r\nof the United Nations itself. While all of us, through \r\nour interactions and exchanges in the Organization, \r\nwork as ambassadors of cross-cultural and religious \r\ndialogue, such resolutions are crucial reminders of the \r\nsignificance of endeavours that bring the peoples of the \r\nworld together.\r\nThe world is at a crossroads. Questions that \r\nwere considered settled decades ago have started \r\nresurfacing. The very need for collaborating and \r\ncooperating with one another as equal partners in \r\nthis interconnected and interdependent world is being \r\nchallenged. Multilateralism is facing an unprecedented \r\nassault from a new kind of populist nationalism based \r\non a myopic world view. Xenophobia and Islamophobia \r\nare on the rise and diversity is increasingly considered \r\na threat. Fear is being deployed openly as a tactic to \r\nsway public opinion. Suspicion and ignorance among \r\nvarious civilizations and religions are being exploited \r\nby demagogues, extremists and terrorists to further \r\ntheir interests and fuel discord and hatred.\r\nIt is therefore all the more important to reinforce \r\nour collective commitment to the ideals of peaceful \r\ncoexistence and to strengthen it by encouraging \r\npeacemakers and bridge-builders in their work. We \r\nmust also support efforts that promote healthy and \r\nproductive dialogue and understanding among all \r\nreligions and civilizations with a view to finding \r\ncommon ground and convergence of opinion. As they \r\nare based on eternal values that benefit humankind, \r\nreligions and cultures have more in common than what \r\ndivides them. We must build on those shared values. \r\nOur diversity remains our biggest asset. It enables us to \r\nappreciate that there is an intrinsic value and advantage \r\nin interacting with those who appear different or follow \r\nother religions or cultural traditions. But for that to \r\nhappen, we all have to come together and join hands to \r\neliminate prejudices, stereotypes and biases and engage \r\nin constructive dialogue. We also have to rethink our \r\n12/12/2018 A/73/PV.51\r\n18-43387 5/24\r\nperspectives in order to pursue our goals in a structured \r\nand all-inclusive manner.\r\nThis draft resolution does exactly that. It promotes \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue and encourages \r\nthose working for peace, harmony, moderation, better \r\nunderstanding among people and a global cultural for \r\npeace. In that context, we also recognize the important \r\nwork of UNESCO and the invaluable contribution of \r\nthe United Nations Alliance for Civilization — they \r\nboth do a remarkable job in promoting interreligious \r\nand intercultural dialogue at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels.\r\nOn behalf of the delegations of Pakistan and the \r\nPhilippines, I would like to thank all Member States for \r\ntaking an active part in the negotiations this year and \r\nenriching the text further with their invaluable input. \r\nWe also appreciate those who have been able to join \r\nus as sponsors and hope that more will be able to do so \r\nnow. By adopting this draft resolution, we hope that the \r\nGeneral Assembly will send a strong message to those \r\nwho attempt to take advantage of our differences.\r\nMs. Md Jaini (Brunei Darussalam): I have the \r\nhonour to deliver this statement on behalf of the 10 \r\nStates members of the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN).\r\nAt the outset, we would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his insightful report (A/73/391) and for \r\nUNESCO’s valuable input. As the report aptly captures, \r\nwe have a pressing need not only for peace but also for \r\nthe collective commitment and action required to meet \r\nour shared global responsibility, particularly against \r\nthe current global backdrop.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to thank Bangladesh, \r\nPakistan and the Philippines for their efforts in \r\nfacilitating the draft resolutions proposed under this \r\nitem. In addition, we congratulate the representatives \r\nof Venezuela, who spoke on behalf of the Movement of \r\nNon-Aligned Countries, and Uzbekistan on presenting \r\ntheir respective initiatives. ASEAN is pleased to \r\nparticipate once again in this year’s debate and share \r\nwith the international community what it is doing to \r\nadvance this noble endeavour.\r\nHome to more than 600 million people, South-East \r\nAsia is blessed with a multitude of ethnicities, religions, \r\nlanguages and cultures. Indeed, promoting a culture of \r\npeace has been an intrinsic value of our Association \r\nsince its establishment more than 50 years ago. ASEAN \r\ncontinues to strongly uphold that notion through the \r\nimplementation of the its Community Vision 2025, \r\nwhich encompasses our shared aspiration for a rules-\r\nbased, inclusive, people-oriented, people-centred and \r\nresilient ASEAN community.\r\nASEAN is also committed to maintaining and \r\npromoting enduring peace, security and stability in \r\nthe region, as well as to the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes without resorting to the threat or use of force, \r\nin accordance with the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, the ASEAN Charter, the \r\nTreaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia and \r\nuniversally recognized principles of international law.\r\nIn line with the shifting global focus on prevention, \r\nin 2017 ASEAN adopted the Declaration on a Culture of \r\nPrevention for a Peaceful, Inclusive, Resilient, Healthy \r\nand Harmonious Society. The Declaration represents a \r\nparadigm shift in our mindset that will better enable \r\nus to comprehensively respond to challenges that \r\nhamper sustainable human and social development \r\nin the region. Among other things, it recognizes the \r\nneed to support a culture of prevention across the \r\nthree pillars of ASEAN and encapsulates six driving \r\nprinciples — first, promoting a culture of peace and \r\nintercultural understanding; secondly, promoting a \r\nculture of respect for all; thirdly, promoting a culture \r\nof good governance at all levels; fourthly, promoting \r\na culture of resilience and care for the environment; \r\nfifthly, promoting a culture of leading a healthy \r\nlifestyle; and sixthly, promoting a culture of supporting \r\nthe values of moderation.\r\nWe believe that ASEAN’s initiative to promote \r\na culture of prevention complements the culture \r\nof sustainable peace and the prevention agenda at \r\nthe United Nations, and we look forward to closer \r\ncooperation with the Organization in jointly developing \r\nproject initiatives to promote a culture of prevention.\r\nASEAN also places great emphasis on quality \r\neducation and inculcating the values of togetherness, \r\nharmony and tolerance from a very young age. We \r\nhave several initiatives in that regard, such as the \r\nASEAN Youth Volunteer Programme, a dedicated \r\nvolunteer platform for young people that supports the \r\nexchange of learning experiences, seeks to develop \r\ncapacities and enhance cross-cultural understanding \r\nand good neighbourliness and fosters a sense of \r\nshared responsibility.\r\nA/73/PV.51 12/12/2018\r\n6/24 18-43387\r\nFurthermore, we were happy to participate in the \r\nconvening of the second ASEAN Youth Interfaith \r\nCamp in Indonesia last month, which brought together \r\na religiously and culturally diverse group of young \r\npeople from the region to participate in dialogue, \r\ndiscussions and seminars. There is certainly much \r\ninterest in making that a recurring project, and we \r\nencourage the international community, in particular \r\nour dialogue partners, to collaborate with ASEAN in \r\nsupporting that initiative.\r\nASEAN commends the work of various regional \r\nand international organizations, notably the United \r\nNations, for promoting a culture of peace and stressing \r\nthe importance of intercultural and interreligious \r\ndialogue. Given that next year marks the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace, the \r\nconvening in September of the High-level Forum on the \r\nCulture of Peace was timely and afforded participants \r\nthe opportunity to exchange views on ways to further \r\npromote a culture of peace.\r\nWe welcome the invaluable role of the United Nations \r\nAlliance of Civilizations in promoting intercultural \r\ndialogue, greater understanding and respect among \r\ncivilizations, cultures, religions and beliefs. ASEAN \r\nappreciates the role played by Turkey and Spain, as the \r\nsponsors of the Alliance, at its eighth Global Forum, \r\nheld recently in New York. The Secretary-General’s \r\nstrong support of that initiative is also much appreciated. \r\nFinally, we want to acknowledge the dedicated service \r\nand outstanding contribution made to the Alliance by \r\nthe outgoing High Representative.\r\nASEAN continues to support efforts by UNESCO, \r\nincluding through its action plan for the International \r\nDecade for the Rapprochement of Cultures (2013-2022). \r\nWe are pleased to note the emphasis on harnessing the \r\npotential of the media to foster mutual understanding \r\nand respect, tolerance and cooperation, as well as \r\nthe involvement of youth and women in cultivating a \r\nculture of peace.\r\nIn conclusion, ASEAN remains steadfast in \r\nits commitment to upholding a culture of peace, as \r\nenshrined in our founding principles and Charter, and \r\nwill continue to play an active role in that endeavour. \r\nWe stand ready to work alongside all regional and \r\ninternational partners and complement the work of the \r\nUnited Nations to that end.\r\nMr. Elmajerbi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation has taken note of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/73/391) on the promotion of a culture of \r\npeace and interreligious and intercultural dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace, which \r\nreviews progress in the reporting period on preventing \r\nconflict and maintaining peace, as well as the measures \r\ntaken at the level of the United Nations system.\r\nThe concept of a culture of peace has been closely \r\nlinked to the United Nations Organization since its \r\ninception in 1945. The Preamble to the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations states:\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations \r\ndetermined to save succeeding generations from \r\nthe scourge of war… and to reaffirm faith in \r\nfundamental human rights”.\r\nUNESCO has also played a crucial role in the \r\ninclusion of issues related to peace and a culture of \r\npeace in all its programmes and regular activities, in \r\nline with its Constitution, which states that “since wars \r\nbegin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that \r\nthe defences of peace must be constructed”. In addition, \r\nin its resolution 53/243 of 6 October 1999, on a culture \r\nof peace, the General Assembly provided guidelines \r\nfor Governments, international organizations and \r\ncivil society that can be used to support and foster a \r\nculture of peace. The link between culture and peace \r\nhas therefore become established as a new concept \r\nin peacebuilding.\r\nWe all know that peace involves reconciliation \r\nbetween two parties in the presence of harmony \r\nand the absence of hatred. In that regard, peace is a \r\nstate of harmony, security and stability in the family, \r\nsociety and the whole world, since it contributes to \r\nprosperity for all. We must work to realize the three \r\nconcepts of peace: peacemaking — helping the \r\nparties to a conflict to reach a negotiated agreement; \r\npeacekeeping — preventing parties from relapsing into \r\nconflict; and peacebuilding — creating the necessary \r\nconditions for societies to live in peace. That involves \r\nwork on many levels, such as educating people about \r\nhuman rights, achieving economic development, \r\nincreasing aid and realizing social solidarity.\r\nFostering a culture of peace requires that we work \r\ntogether, shoulder to shoulder, to combat intellectual \r\nextremism in all of its forms and manifestations, such \r\nas the exclusion of others and incitement to violence. \r\nIt requires educating our young people and nurturing \r\n12/12/2018 A/73/PV.51\r\n18-43387 7/24\r\nour educational institutions. The role of the media and \r\nmodern technical means must also be revitalized.\r\nThe concept of peace does not mean merely putting \r\nan end to war. As I have said before, it is an ongoing \r\nprocess that must be based on a set of values and \r\nprinciples for the creation of a culture of peace that \r\nbrings stability to human societies and constitutes a \r\nsource of power and prosperity.\r\nWe all know that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment is a commitment to strengthening \r\npeaceful and inclusive societies. It stresses that \r\nsustainable development cannot be achieved without \r\npeace and security, which is why we must work together \r\nto achieve Sustainable Development Goal 16 and \r\nensure that inclusive and participatory decisions are \r\nmade at all levels with a view to achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We emphasize that Governments, the \r\ninternational community and local communities should \r\nwork together to implement lasting solutions to end \r\nviolence, achieve justice and guarantee the participation \r\nof all.\r\nThe promotion of a culture of peace and \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding \r\nand cooperation for peace does not mean fusing \r\nreligions and faiths or even cultures. Rather, a culture \r\nof peace is the sphere within which people’s religions \r\nand cultures coexist. The aim of dialogue among \r\ncivilizations is to study and address the root causes \r\nof their differences and to humbly learn the ethics of \r\ntolerating those differences.\r\nAdvancing a culture of peace is a process that \r\nrequires belief and freedom of thought and expression, \r\nas well as the eradication of poverty and unemployment \r\nand fostering public awareness about the peacemaking \r\nprocess. It is impossible to instil a culture of peace and \r\nnon-violence in people who are deprived of their most \r\nbasic right to a decent life. My country calls from this \r\nrostrum for the Assembly to respect and apply such \r\nrights in order to create a better world that will include \r\nall of us, a world that enjoys friendliness, tolerance \r\nand peace.\r\nIn conclusion, I thank all Member States that \r\nsubmitted draft resolutions calling for the promotion of \r\na culture of peace and interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace, \r\nwhich will foster the principles of tolerance and respect \r\nfor cultural diversity as a means to prevent the outbreak \r\nof conflicts.\r\nMr. Mohammad (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAt the outset, my delegation would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/73/391), which \r\ncontains information on topics and actions undertaken \r\nby key United Nations entities in order to promote a \r\nculture of peace and interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace. My \r\ncountry also commends all the efforts, good offices \r\nand pivotal role of UNESCO in strengthening and \r\nconsolidating a culture of peace, culminating in the \r\nimplementation of the Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction on a Culture of Peace and the Action Plan for \r\nthe International Decade for the Rapprochement of \r\nCultures (2013-2022).\r\nMore than ever before, the world today is facing \r\nincreasingly complex threats and challenges at all \r\nlevels — State, societal and even individual — including \r\nchallenges and threats that undermine and threaten \r\nthe spread of a culture of peace. Regrettably, disputes \r\nand conflicts are sometimes fuelled by intolerance, \r\nextremism, violence and religious and ethnic tensions, \r\nowing to, among other things, the rejection of others, \r\nintolerance, exclusion and a lack of awareness of \r\nthe need to coexist. Some have been using violent \r\nextremism as a means of expression. Such acts prompt \r\nus to make concerted efforts at the local, regional and \r\ninternational levels to achieve the goal to which we \r\nall aspire, namely, to transform the culture of hatred, \r\nintolerance and war into one of dialogue, coexistence \r\nand peace. In that context, Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 16 represents a compass and a road map for all \r\ncountries and societies to achieve that goal, which calls \r\nfor establishing inclusive and peaceful societies for all. \r\nAs peace and development are interrelated, promoting \r\na culture of peace and dialogue among societies and \r\nreligions is crucial to achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General highlights \r\nimportant tools and means for contributing to the \r\nachievement of peace, such as preventive diplomacy, \r\nconflict prevention, mediation and dialogue. In that \r\nregard, we call on Member States and international \r\nand regional organizations to redouble their efforts \r\nto operationalize such preventive tools and measures, \r\nwhich aim to prevent conflicts by tackling them as \r\nsoon as they emerge and determining their root causes. \r\nPreventive diplomacy, mediation and the resolution of \r\nconflicts by peaceful means are fundamental pillars of \r\nKuwaiti foreign policy. Applying those tools has been \r\nA/73/PV.51 12/12/2018\r\n8/24 18-43387\r\na priority for the State of Kuwait during its current \r\nmembership on the Security Council.\r\nA culture of peace is deeply entrenched in my \r\ncountry. One of the articles of the Kuwaiti Constitution \r\nexplicitly states that peace is the goal of the State. In \r\nthe State of Kuwait, we have fostered freedom and \r\na culture of tolerance and coexistence as a means of \r\ndeveloping our society. The Constitution of the State \r\nof Kuwait enshrines those values and concepts in its \r\narticles, which set forth the rights and duties of every \r\ncitizen, irrespective of their ethnicity, origin, language \r\nor religion. The Constitution also stresses that justice, \r\nfreedom and equality are the pillars of our society and \r\nthat cooperation and compassion forge a strong bond \r\namong citizens.\r\nThe State of Kuwait is ranked highest among \r\nMiddle East and North African countries on the 2018 \r\nGlobal Peace Index, reflecting my country’s faith in a \r\nculture of peace, which was deeply rooted in Kuwaiti \r\nsociety even before the emergence of our modern State. \r\nThat culture includes tolerance, the acceptance of others \r\nand dialogue among different cultures and religions. \r\nOur history shows many examples of rapprochement \r\nwith and openness towards different peoples and \r\ncivilizations. In our modern era, those values have \r\nbeen translated into our Constitution, which guarantees \r\nthe right to freedom of speech, freedom of belief and \r\nfreedom of practicing religious rituals, in complete \r\nliberty and safety.\r\nThe State of Kuwait is considered an amalgam of \r\ndifferent peoples, embracing people of many different \r\nnationalities, religions and cultures who enjoy security, \r\nstability, mutual respect and a dignified life.\r\nIn conclusion, my country’s delegation stresses \r\nthe importance of intensifying our efforts to promote \r\na culture of peace, reinvigorate the dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, disseminate the values of moderation, \r\ntolerance and mutual respect and renounce extremism, \r\nhatred and violence in all its forms and manifestations. \r\nThat is a responsibility that must be shouldered by all \r\nMember States and that requires us to work together \r\nthrough our multilateral system.\r\nMs. Al Daah (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): A culture of peace is not a new concept for \r\nus. Our shared values call for tolerance, respect and \r\nappreciation for individuals, irrespective of their \r\nethnicity, religion, culture or ideology. That is a \r\nfundamental principle of the Muslim, Christian and \r\nJewish faiths and others. The United Nations is working \r\nto enhance a culture of peace. It represents a forum \r\nin which we celebrate the differences that enrich our \r\nhuman civilizations and the multiplicity of our cultures. \r\nUnited Nations principles are based on strengthening \r\nfriendly inter-State relations while promoting dialogue \r\nand understanding among peoples and nations in \r\norder to unite international efforts to achieve peace \r\nthroughout the world.\r\nDespite the progress that has been made in this \r\narea, the world is now in dire need of intensified \r\ninternational efforts to disseminate a culture of \r\npeace and dialogue among religions and civilizations, \r\nbecause we are facing the dangerous threat posed by \r\nextremist and terrorist groups that seek to achieve \r\ntheir destructive goals through hatred and sectarianism \r\namong individuals. Those groups try to destroy human \r\nand civilized values and cultural heritage in order to \r\nestablish a culture based on violence and extremism.\r\nSince its founding, my country has realized that \r\nbuilding strong and coherent societies and stable and \r\nsecure States requires strengthening the values of \r\ntolerance, respect and the acceptance of other people. \r\nWe recall the late Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, \r\nleader and founder of the United Arab Emirates, \r\nwhose 100th birthday we are celebrating this year, \r\nwho fostered human and compassionate values and \r\nwhose just principles and wise leadership left a great \r\nlegacy for successive Emirati generations, which they \r\nhave emulated in our country’s domestic and foreign \r\nrelations. There are representatives of more than 200 \r\nnationalities living in my country today in peace \r\nand harmony.\r\nBased on that, the United Arab Emirates has \r\nbecome a centre of tolerance and rapprochement among \r\nreligions and global civilizations. We have embraced \r\nmosques, churches and many other houses of worship \r\nso as to enable all to practice their religions. In order \r\nto entrench a culture of tolerance among religions, \r\nmy country gave the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed \r\nMosque in Abu Dhabi the name Mary the Mother of \r\nJesus Mosque. We held the first World Tolerance \r\nSummit in November, chaired by the State Minister for \r\nTolerance, which was attended by 1,500 representatives \r\nfrom Governments, media, cultural and academic \r\norganizations, as well as peace experts and religious \r\nleaders from around the world. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to announce that Pope Francis, a world \r\nsymbol of peace and tolerance, will visit Abu Dhabi in \r\n12/12/2018 A/73/PV.51\r\n18-43387 9/24\r\nFebruary to participate in an international interreligious \r\ndialogue entitled “Human brotherhood”.\r\nMy country is a sponsor of the draft resolutions \r\n(A/73/L.43, A/73/L.48, A/73/L.52 and A/73/L.55) to be \r\nadopted under today’s agenda item, based on our belief \r\nin their importance in spreading a culture of peace. In \r\nthat regard, we would like to recommend taking the \r\nfollowing fundamental steps to promote a culture of \r\npeace, in line with respect for the principles established \r\nby the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nFirst, national, regional and international strategies \r\nmust be put in place to promote peace and tolerance \r\namong peoples. We stress that those strategies must \r\nbe inclusive, in order to address the root causes of \r\nextremism, while ensuring that every sector of society, \r\nespecially minorities, can enjoy protection from \r\ncrimes such as those committed against the Yazidi and \r\nRohingya peoples.\r\nSecondly, specialized agencies must be established \r\nto implement those strategies. For example, my country \r\nhosted the Council of Muslim Sages and the Forum for \r\nPromoting Peace in Muslim Societies in order to engage \r\nreligious leaders in promoting a culture of peace. The \r\nSawab Centre in Abu Dhabi is intended to combat \r\nextremist thought and foster a culture of peace and \r\ntolerance. And the International Institute for Tolerance \r\nsupports those values in the Arab world.\r\nThirdly, relevant legislation must be adopted, such as \r\nthe United Arab Emirates law to combat discrimination \r\nand hatred, which criminalizes discrimination against \r\nindividuals or groups of people based on religion, \r\nsect, ethnicity, colour or origin, while fighting the \r\nexploitation of religion through takfir.\r\nLastly, there must be innovative initiatives to \r\npromote a culture of peace and openness among all \r\ngenerations of young people. In that regard, we should \r\nfocus on curriculums and school programmes that \r\nplay a crucial role in instilling awareness in future \r\ngenerations so that they can confront extremism. \r\nMy country has initiated the Mohammed Bin Rashid \r\nTolerance Award with the aim of producing young Arab \r\nleaders in tolerance-related areas to support cultural \r\nand media initiatives designed to entrench tolerance as \r\na value in the Arab world.\r\nIn conclusion, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed \r\nBin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime \r\nMinister of the United Arab Emirates, said at the \r\ninauguration of the Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi:\r\n“Welcome to a dome of enlightenment in a region \r\nwhere people of dark thoughts are attempting to \r\nbring back the eras of backwardness and ignorance”.\r\nMrs. Rodríguez Camejo (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): As we approach the twentieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of resolution 53/243, Cuba reiterates the \r\nvalidity of the Declaration and Programme of Action \r\non a Culture of Peace, as well as our commitment to \r\nthat agenda and multilateralism. First and foremost, the \r\ninternational community’s efforts to achieve peace must \r\nfocus on full respect for the principles of the sovereignty, \r\nterritorial integrity and political independence of States \r\nand non-interference in matters strictly under their \r\ndomestic jurisdiction, in accordance with the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and international law. The root \r\ncauses of conflicts, including extreme poverty, hunger, \r\ninequality, exclusion and a lack of access to quality \r\nhealth and education services, must be eliminated \r\nimmediately. Understanding, tolerance, solidarity and \r\nrespect for the cultures, histories, religions and the \r\nspecificities of every nation must be promoted.\r\nDespite the continued international call to achieve \r\nand strengthen a culture of peace, problems hindering \r\nand undermining the real possibilities of achieving such \r\na noble goal persist. They include the covert promotion \r\nof regime change in developing countries; certain \r\nStates’ violation of principles of international law; the \r\nuse or threat of use of force, which runs contrary to \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations; the development of \r\nnew, more lethal and extremely sophisticated weapons, \r\nincluding the continued existence of large nuclear \r\narsenals; unilateral coercive measures; and intolerance \r\nand discrimination based on ethnic, religious or racial \r\ngrounds. All of that must end. A culture of peace \r\nalso requires the unwavering condemnation of all \r\nacts, methods and practices of terrorism, as well as \r\nconcrete action to combat that scourge, regardless of \r\nthe form it takes and who perpetrates it, including \r\nterrorism perpetrated by States. Nor do manipulative \r\npolicies and double standards on issues such as human \r\nrights, aimed at singling out developing countries and \r\ndiscrediting their legitimate Governments, contribute \r\nto the ideal of a culture of peace. The Proclamation of \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace, \r\nadopted in 2014 in Havana during the second Summit \r\nof Heads of State and Government of the Community \r\nof Latin American and Caribbean States, demonstrated \r\nA/73/PV.51 12/12/2018\r\n10/24 18-43387\r\nour region’s commitment to strengthening peace and \r\nnegotiated solutions to conflicts and differences, as \r\nwell as representing a contribution to the culture of \r\npeace at the international level. We therefore reaffirm \r\nits full force and effect.\r\nWe take this opportunity to express Cuba’s gratitude \r\nand support for the draft resolutions (A/73/L.43, \r\nA/73/L.48, A/73/L.52 and A/73/L.55) presented under \r\nthis agenda item. They are all very relevant. We \r\nnote in particular draft resolution A/73/L.48, on an \r\ninternational day of multilateralism and diplomacy for \r\npeace, introduced by the representative of Venezuela \r\non behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. \r\nThat initiative demonstrates the firm commitment of the \r\nMovement’s members and observers to fostering peace, \r\nunderstanding and mutual respect among nations. We \r\ncount on everyone’s support for its adoption.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Maldives): The natural form \r\nof human culture is peace, not war. For every one \r\nof us to live a normal life, we have to communicate \r\nwith other human beings with love and compassion. \r\nGovernments, individuals, civil-society organizations \r\nand international organizations, including the United \r\nNations system, can work individually and collectively \r\nto restore that natural human relationship, cultivate the \r\nvalues of respect, promote mutual understanding and \r\ncherish our shared human identity.\r\nYet those ideals and the principles that underpin the \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of \r\nPeace, adopted by the General Assembly in 1999, are \r\nunder threat. Innocent women and men, girls and boys \r\nare attacked because of their ethnicity or religion. The \r\nDeclaration rightly puts enormous faith in the power \r\nof education, propelled by an extraordinary level of \r\npolitical commitment to overcoming such challenges. \r\nWe are quite encouraged to observe, based on the report \r\nof the Secretary-General (A/73/391), the progress that \r\nUNESCO has made, especially in incorporating the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the targets of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals in its programme \r\nof work to promote a culture of peace. We encourage \r\nUNESCO to work more closely with Governments and \r\neducation providers in various countries to ensure that \r\nthe knowledge that is being transferred to students \r\nis founded on the values of inclusivity, tolerance and \r\nrespect. It is important to ensure that the creative minds \r\nof children and young people are taught to recognize \r\nand appreciate the mutual dependence whereby we \r\nnaturally rely on one another rather than the factors that \r\ndivide us.\r\nMaldives believes that we must work to overcome the \r\nchallenges that countries face in maintaining a continued \r\nfocus on the Declaration on a Culture of Peace. Among \r\nthe most important relevant challenges, especially for \r\nsmall island developing States such as Maldives, is \r\nclimate-induced threats. Vulnerable populations and \r\ntheir cultural heritage, which make up a significant \r\npart of the global tapestry of diversity, require security. \r\nThe changing climate, which the disasters we have \r\nexperienced in recent years have made apparent, puts \r\nthe sustainability of a culture of peace at risk.\r\nThe media, especially social media, represent an \r\nimportant platform for disseminating information. \r\nAt the same time, we have a collective responsibility \r\nto ensure that advances in technology are used to \r\nincrease awareness and educate, not incite hatred and \r\nintolerance. The Maldives condemns all attempts to \r\npromote violent extremism and terrorist activities. \r\nTerrorism is the antithesis of a culture of peace, and \r\ntherefore we must take a stand against terrorism in all \r\nits forms and manifestations with full conviction.\r\nThe newly elected President of Maldives, \r\nMr. Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, believes that cultivating \r\na culture of peace requires a policy shift towards \r\ntolerance, respect, acceptance and unity. That includes \r\nrespect for democratic values and principles that can \r\nfoster a culture of peace while eliminating all forms \r\nof prejudices, discrimination and marginalization. \r\nAt the international level, it involves ending coercive \r\nmeasures to resolve conflict and overcoming issues \r\nthrough negotiations and dialogue. My Government \r\nhopes that today’s discussions and the draft resolutions \r\n(A/73/L.43, A/73/L.48, A/73/L.52 and A/73/L.55) that \r\nwe are about to adopt will help strengthen our faith and \r\nefforts in promoting the values and principles in the \r\nDeclaration on a Culture of Peace so that we can create \r\na more tolerant global society for a more harmonious \r\nand peaceful world for generations to come.\r\nMr. Elnour (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I would first \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his report before \r\nus (A/73/391). I also thank the Permanent Mission of \r\nBangladesh for facilitating the negotiations on draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.43, to be adopted today.\r\nWe also want to express our thanks and \r\nappreciation to UNESCO for its leading role in \r\nconsolidating a culture of peace and coordinating \r\n12/12/2018 A/73/PV.51\r\n18-43387 11/24\r\nefforts by United Nations agencies, programmes and \r\nall other international partners in this vital domain. \r\nThis is an increasingly important area, given the \r\ngrowing problems of xenophobia, targeting migrants \r\nand refugees, Islamophobia and populist rhetoric in \r\nmany parts of the world. If we do not take measures to \r\naddress them as soon as possible, they will damage the \r\nfuture of peace and security throughout the world.\r\nWe also want to note the importance of providing \r\nthe necessary support to developing countries so that \r\nthey can build their national capabilities in areas \r\ndirectly related to a culture of peace, strengthening \r\nnational unity and implementing the eight action \r\nareas of the Declaration and Programme of Action \r\non a Culture of Peace, with a view to leaving no one \r\nbehind in implementing the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. It is important to note that developing nations \r\nare the countries most affected by armed conflict, and \r\nsome face great challenges in managing diversity. It is \r\ntherefore important to implement intensive programmes \r\non a culture of peace, with the aim of strengthening \r\nthe values of tolerance, respect for others and peaceful \r\ncoexistence as a firm foundation for sustainable peace \r\nin the future. We must also work together in order to \r\nenable those States to benefit from the tremendous \r\ncommunication and information technology revolution \r\nand the great opportunities for enhancing a culture of \r\npeace and tolerance, as opposed to using such modern \r\ntechnology to promote xenophobia, reject the other and \r\nadvance stereotypes.\r\nThe Sudan firmly believes that preventing wars \r\nand silencing guns are a first step necessary to promote \r\na culture of peace, especially in countries dealing with \r\ninternal conflicts. My country has made tireless efforts \r\nto achieve peace and security in neighbouring countries. \r\nMediation undertaken by the Intergovernmental \r\nAuthority on Development and led by my country \r\nculminated on 12 September in the signing of the \r\nRevitalized Peace Agreement on the Resolution of the \r\nConflict in the Republic of South Sudan. My country \r\nis also making tireless efforts within the framework \r\nof the African Union (AU) to achieve peace and \r\nreconciliation in the Central African Republic. In that \r\nregard, my delegation would like to express its hope for \r\nsupport from all the relevant parties and the AU. On \r\n29 November, my country hosted a meeting of Foreign \r\nMinisters of Libya’s neighbours to advance the peace \r\nprocess in that brother country, and that was on top \r\nof efforts that we undertook with Chad, Libya and the \r\nNiger with a view to securing Libya’s southern border. \r\nWe hope those efforts will be successful in terms of \r\nachieving peace and stability in our sister State of Libya.\r\nWith respect to completing the peace process in \r\nthe Sudan, my Government is continuing its tireless \r\nand intensive efforts to resume negotiations with the \r\narmed movements in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue \r\nNile states. We hope that African mediation efforts and \r\nthose of all our other partners will come to fruition and \r\nhelp to promote a culture of peace. We are also making \r\nefforts to extend the ceasefire in order to ensure an \r\nenvironment conducive to holding political negotiations \r\nand facilitating humanitarian work.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to stress \r\nthat a culture of peace at the international level can be \r\nestablished and strengthened only in a world where there \r\nis strict commitment to the principles of international \r\nlaw and respect for the Charter of the United Nations, \r\none where conflicts are resolved through peaceful \r\nmeans and preventive diplomacy, while avoiding double \r\nstandards in international politics, respecting human \r\nrights and eschewing political manipulation.\r\nMr. Al Shuaibi (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/73/391) on the \r\nactivities of United Nations entities to promote a culture \r\nof peace and interreligious and intercultural dialogue \r\nstresses the importance of preventive diplomacy and \r\nadapting the concepts of peacebuilding and sustaining \r\npeace. The efforts of UNESCO and other organizations \r\nnoted in the report faced significant challenges from \r\nissues such  increased migration, growing populations \r\nand technological advances, highlighting the fact that \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue are more \r\nimportant than ever.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman has a diverse heritage of \r\nculture and civilization. Historically, the people of Oman \r\nhave communicated with peoples all over the world and \r\nhave promoted peace through their dealings and ethical \r\nbehaviour, especially maritime voyages, which imbued \r\nour people with diverse cultural experiences and \r\nconfidence in their values, enabling Oman to establish \r\nstrong partnerships with countries around the world. \r\nWe have also benefited from our unique geographic \r\nlocation, which has helped us strengthen our foreign \r\nrelations and support regional and international peace.\r\nBased on our firm positions, as established by \r\nSultan Qaboos Bin Said, the State of Oman has been \r\nable to build the right foundations for tolerance and \r\nA/73/PV.51 12/12/2018\r\n12/24 18-43387\r\ncoexistence within Omani society, promoting them \r\nthrough an inclusive development policy in all areas \r\nof society, while consolidating legal, educational and \r\nmedia values and giving human values sustainability \r\nand depth at the individual and societal levels. Omani \r\npeople have therefore been encouraged to be open and \r\nrespectful of other peoples while maintaining their \r\npersonal Omani culture, of which they are proud.\r\nWith regard to the concept of intercultural dialogue, \r\nthe Sultanate of Oman has adopted several measures \r\nto make its successful experience known abroad. That \r\nincludes, for example, a series of exhibitions entitled \r\n“The Message of Islam from Oman”. Many scientific \r\nchairs and fellowships have also been established in \r\nnumerous world-renowned universities. There are now \r\n16 Sultan Qaboos Scientific Chairs so far, teaching \r\nabout Arab and Islamic cultures and their relationship \r\nto other cultures and religions.\r\nRegarding other Government actions, the National \r\nOmani Commission for Education, Culture and \r\nScience is launching an international initiative to \r\nfoster  communication between cultures designed to \r\nenable young people from around the world to meet in \r\nour country and conduct a cultural dialogue aimed at \r\npromoting the concepts of tolerance and acceptance of \r\nothers. The Sultanate of Oman also annually invites a \r\nnumber of students from other countries to teach them \r\nArabic, part of a policy of introducing young people to \r\nother cultures and languages.\r\nWith regard to international relations, our firm \r\npolicies are based on the concepts of mutual respect, \r\ngood-neighbourliness and the promotion of justice and \r\ninternational legitimacy and non-interference in the \r\naffairs of other countries so as to foster international \r\npeace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, we thank all the countries that have \r\nsubmitted draft resolutions on a culture of peace, all of \r\nwhich we emphatically support.\r\nMr. Escalante Hasbún (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My delegation welcomes the adoption of \r\nthe annual draft resolution contained in document \r\nA/73/L.43, on the follow-up to the Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace, which \r\nhighlights the important inclusion of the promotion of \r\na culture of peace in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. As always, we thank the Permanent \r\nMission of Bangladesh for its efforts to facilitate the \r\ndraft resolution.\r\nEl Salvador believes that safeguarding and \r\npromoting historical memory and a culture of peace \r\nis a decisive element in building a tolerant society \r\ncapable of harmonious coexistence. It also offers a \r\nwide range of possibilities and capacities for promoting \r\na comprehensive transformation aimed at achieving an \r\ninclusive society, especially where historically excluded \r\npopulation groups are concerned.\r\nThe draft resolution highlights the contribution \r\nof early-childhood development to the development \r\nof more peaceful societies. In that regard, one of my \r\nGovernment’s objectives is to ensure not only that girls \r\nand boys complete primary and secondary education, \r\nbut also that they emerge with relevant and effective \r\nacademic results, including an appreciation for \r\ncoexistence and a culture of peace.\r\nOur country highlights the important role played \r\nby women and young people in contributing to \r\nprevention and conflict resolution in peacebuilding, as \r\nevident in our national promotion of Security Council \r\nresolutions 1325 (2000) and 2250 (2015), on the role \r\nof women and youth in peace and security, on which \r\nmy country has made progress in establishing national \r\nplans and committees.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the call in the draft resolution \r\nthat we are about to adopt for ensuring that the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture continues to promote \r\npost-conflict consolidation activities and achieving \r\nsustainable peace. At the national level, El Salvador, \r\nboth as a member of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nand of the General Assembly, actively participated in \r\nthis year’s negotiations on the peace and security pillar \r\nreforms proposed by the Secretary-General.\r\nThis draft resolution is becoming a frame of \r\nreference for the implementation of actions and \r\ndecision-making in countries such as mine that have \r\nmoved from conflict towards peace. In El Salvador we \r\nreached a predominantly political  peace agreement that \r\nenabled us to end our conflict, but today, 26 years after \r\nthat feat, we realize that a political agreement is not \r\nenough, and that a national socioeconomic agreement \r\nthat includes all sectors of the population is essential.\r\nMy Government recognizes the importance of \r\nbuilding a culture of peace in the process of implementing \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its \r\n17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With regard \r\nto SDG 16, El Salvador has already joined a global \r\nworking alliance through which, between 2015 and \r\n12/12/2018 A/73/PV.51\r\n18-43387 13/24\r\nOctober of this year, we reduced the homicide rate in \r\nour country by 27 per cent. We did that by implementing \r\npolicies, plans and institutions for safety and security \r\nand peaceful coexistence among our citizens, while \r\ngiving women a leading role, deepening alliances with \r\nnon-State actors and increasing statistical capacities.\r\nAs part of creating an inclusive and participative \r\nsociety, we believe it is important to develop and \r\nestablish strong institutions aimed at disseminating \r\nand promoting a culture of access to information and \r\nGovernment accountability. We have established a \r\nsecretariat for active transparency in order to promote \r\ninitiatives to reduce all forms of corruption and bribery.\r\nWe would obviously like to highlight UNESCO’s \r\nwork in mobilizing actors and synergies in support of a \r\nculture of peace, and we consider it important to ensure \r\nthat all Member States support UNESCO in playing \r\nan active role in implementing a culture of peace and \r\nits linkages with the various targets and Goals of the \r\n2030 Agenda, as well as in the related events taking \r\nplace here in New York. In that regard, we also want to \r\nhighlight paragraph 16 of draft resolution A/73/L.43, \r\nand to reiterate to the President of the Assembly our \r\nrecommendation that we convene a high-level forum \r\ndedicated to the implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction in September 2019, as part of its follow-up and \r\nties to the sustainable development frameworks in force \r\nsince 2015.\r\nMr. Suan (Myanmar): My delegation thanks \r\nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive report \r\n(A/73/391), and UNESCO for its valuable input.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Brunei Darussalam on behalf \r\nof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\r\nWe would also like to express our appreciation to \r\nall delegations that have taken the initiative to present \r\ndraft resolutions under this agenda item.\r\nBuilding peace and national reconciliation are \r\nthe most important tasks that the Government and the \r\npeople of Myanmar are undertaking today to ensure the \r\nrule of law, stability, democracy and development in \r\nour country. A series of 21st Century Panglong Peace \r\nConferences is being held to forge lasting peace. The \r\nConferences seek to put an end to the armed strife that \r\nhas ravaged Myanmar since it became an independent \r\nnation in 1948, and to build a democratic federal union \r\nfounded on lasting unity created out of diversity. Our \r\nnational experience has taught us that the road to peace \r\nhas never been an easy path to tread, but that it is the \r\nonly way that will lead to our long-held aspiration of a \r\npeaceful and prosperous nation. We believe in a culture \r\nof dialogue for reconciling differences, building \r\ntrust and confidence and pursuing lasting peace and \r\nsustainable development for all.\r\nMyanmar is one of the most ethnically diverse \r\ncountries in the world. It is home to 135 officially \r\nrecognized ethnic groups, each with its own distinctive \r\nculture and adherence to different faiths. As a \r\nmultireligious country, where faithful followers of \r\nall four major religions live in peace and harmony, \r\nfreedom of religion and the right to preserve one’s \r\ncultural identity and heritage are guaranteed by the \r\nConstitution. The promotion of interfaith dialogue plays \r\na vital role in creating a culture of tolerance, mutual \r\nrespect and understanding among people from diverse \r\nreligions and cultures. We have established interfaith \r\nfriendship groups at the national level, with more than \r\n100 subgroups across the country. Interfaith dialogues, \r\nawareness talks and combined prayer services for peace \r\nand national reconciliation have been held all over the \r\ncountry.\r\nRecently, on 1 November, we held a Religions for \r\nPeace Advisory Forum on National Reconciliation and \r\nPeace in Myanmar at the highest national level in order \r\nto promote peace among religions. At the meeting, \r\nState Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi highlighted \r\ninterfaith dialogue as a vital path to peace, saying \r\nthat we must promote interfaith dialogue and that \r\nrespect and understanding for religious and cultural \r\ndiversity contribute to lasting peace and security. She \r\nwent on to emphasize that for interfaith dialogue to \r\nbe truly effective, it should not be limited to religious \r\nleaders but should extend to all, so that it results in a \r\nmeeting of hearts and minds. She also emphasized the \r\nimportance of addressing education, which is essential \r\nin overcoming prejudices, stereotyping, mistrust and \r\ndiscrimination. Through education we can promote a \r\nculture of peace that ensures mutual respect.\r\nWe see today how in many parts of the world \r\nreligion is being misused by extremists to justify \r\nviolence and acts of terrorism. Intolerance and religious \r\nextremism are extremely damaging to sustaining peace \r\nand harmony in a diverse society. We must address \r\nthe root causes of violent extremism. The terrorist \r\nattacks committed by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation \r\nArmy, which began in October 2016 and recurred \r\nA/73/PV.51 12/12/2018\r\n14/24 18-43387\r\non 25 August 2017 in northern Rakhine state, have \r\ntriggered an immense humanitarian problem that has \r\naffected innocent people of all religions. Today peace \r\nand reconciliation are urgently needed in Rakhine \r\nstate. In fact, for my Government the rule of law and \r\ndevelopment in Rakhine are among its highest priorities \r\nin addressing long-neglected, fundamental issues of \r\nfear, anger, frustration and poverty in the region. We \r\nbelieve in finding constructive and sustainable ways to \r\nbuild harmony and trust among all communities and \r\nbring about peace and prosperity for all in Rakhine.\r\nSustainable peace is not simply the absence of \r\nconflict. The presence of values and beliefs in our \r\nhearts will strengthen peace and reconciliation. In this \r\nincreasingly interconnected and interdependent world, \r\nwe must all work together in partnership for peace and \r\ndevelopment through dialogue on a basis of equality \r\nand mutual respect.\r\nSustainable peace is essential for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Peace and development are two sides of \r\nthe same coin. Only by promoting a culture of peace \r\nwill it be possible to create peace and harmony among \r\ndiverse communities and societies, thereby creating a \r\nconducive environment and favourable conditions for \r\nsustainable development. I am confident that through \r\ndialogue and by fostering closer cooperation among \r\ndifferent faiths, we will be able to build a global culture \r\nof peace that will ensure that our world is a better place, \r\nwith a better future for succeeding generations.\r\nMr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): The efforts of the \r\ninternational community to promote a culture of peace \r\nhave gained strong impetus from the relevant annual \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly, which have \r\nproclaimed fundamental principles and commitments \r\nand defined a set of actions at the national, regional and \r\nglobal levels.\r\nAzerbaijan supports draft resolutions A/73/L.43, \r\nA/73/L.48, A/73/L.52 and A/73/L.55, and looks \r\nforward to their adoption by consensus. We thank the \r\ndelegations of Bangladesh, the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and the Philippines \r\nfor their skilful efforts and leadership in facilitating \r\nthe negotiations on the draft resolutions and for their \r\nstrong commitment to promoting interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nacknowledges the world’s natural and cultural diversity \r\nand recognizes that all cultures and civilizations can \r\ncontribute to sustainable development and are crucial \r\nto enabling it. The promotion of a culture of peace is \r\nalso important in the context of addressing conflicts. \r\nAzerbaijan fully supports the Secretary-General’s \r\nefforts aimed at preventing conflicts, responding early \r\nand effectively to crisis situations, assisting Member \r\nStates in their endeavours to sustain peace and build \r\nresilient and prosperous societies and making the \r\nUnited Nations more coherent, integrated, effective \r\nand efficient.\r\nWe note the leading role of UNESCO and the \r\nwork of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations in \r\npromoting intercultural dialogue, and we commend the \r\ncooperation in that area between the United Nations and \r\nregional and other organizations. Azerbaijan considers \r\nthe promotion of intercultural and interreligious \r\ndialogue at the national and international levels to be \r\nof major importance. In recent years, my country has \r\nhosted a number of results-oriented international events \r\nand put forward important initiatives to encourage \r\ndialogue and mutual understanding.\r\nAmong them is the Baku Process, successfully \r\nimplemented under the leadership of Azerbaijan, \r\nwhich provides a large-scale platform for the exchange \r\nof knowledge on interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue. In the Secretary-General’s report on the \r\ntopic submitted to the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session (A/72/488), he specifically mentioned \r\nthe important role of the Baku Process in advocating \r\nfor dialogue among cultures. The Process marks its \r\ntenth anniversary this year, with the high-level sixth \r\nBaku International Humanitarian Forum held earlier \r\nthis year with the participation of Governments, \r\ninternational organizations, scholars, young people and \r\ncivil society.\r\nAn integral part of the Baku Process is the World \r\nForum on Intercultural Dialogue, organized biennially \r\nby Azerbaijan in cooperation with several international \r\norganizations. We welcome the reference to the \r\nWorld Forum as a key global platform for promoting \r\nintercultural dialogue made in resolution 72/136, \r\nentitled “Promotion of interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace”, \r\nand in draft resolution A/73/L.55, to be adopted today.\r\nIn the Secretary-General’s report on the promotion \r\nof a culture of peace and interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace \r\n(A/73/391), submitted to the General Assembly at its \r\n12/12/2018 A/73/PV.51\r\n18-43387 15/24\r\nseventy-third session, he also noted the contribution \r\nof the Government of Azerbaijan to the development \r\nby UNESCO of its e-platform aimed at serving \r\nas an international hub to facilitate networking \r\namong different stakeholders working in the field of \r\nintercultural dialogue.\r\nContinued support from the United Nations and \r\nthe broader international community for successful \r\ninitiatives on intercultural dialogue, a culture of peace \r\nand multiculturalism is essential to building peaceful \r\nand inclusive societies, overcoming stereotypes \r\nand misconceptions and implementing development \r\nframeworks and policies. The Republic of Azerbaijan is \r\nkeen to continue its efforts towards promoting mutual \r\nunderstanding, respect for diversity and enhanced \r\ncooperation to that end.\r\nMr. Arrocha Ruíz (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation would like to make a general statement \r\non agenda item 15, entitled “Culture of peace”, and in \r\nthat regard, I want to begin by welcoming the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General (A/73/391) entitled “Promotion \r\nof a culture of peace and interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace”.\r\nAs we continue the International Decade for the \r\nRapprochement of Cultures (2013-2022), whose efforts \r\nare led by UNESCO, it is worth reflecting on our \r\ncurrent global context. Although the United Nations \r\nhas promoted a series of measures aimed at promoting \r\na culture of peace, the complex reality of conflicts in \r\nvarious parts of the world that threaten international \r\npeace and security demonstrates the importance of \r\nfocusing on adjusting our approach. Consequently, \r\nas we commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Declaration and Programme of Action \r\non a Culture of Peace, the international community \r\nmust work actively to renew its global commitment \r\nundertaken in 1999, in order to entrench a culture of \r\nsustainable peace built on a set of values, attitudes, \r\ntraditions, behaviours and lifestyles based on respect, \r\nnon-violence, the promotion of human rights, the \r\npeaceful settlement of conflicts, the protection of the \r\nenvironment, development, gender equity and freedom \r\nof expression and information, among other things.\r\nAs we have noted before, a culture of peace \r\nrepresents the very essence of our Organization and \r\ncuts across the three pillars that guide the work of the \r\nUnited Nations — sustainable development, peace \r\nand security and human rights. We therefore agree \r\nthat collective efforts for peacebuilding, through a \r\npreventive approach, are fundamental to promoting the \r\ninclusion of all actors in our society and ensuring that \r\nmultilateralism attains its full significance.\r\nToday’s threats to peace are not minor. Our \r\ncomplex global reality is also challenged by climate \r\nchange, migration and terrorism, among other issues of \r\nconcern to the international community, because they \r\nthreaten our peoples’ lives. For that reason, addressing \r\nthe causes of conflicts and putting into practice the \r\nprinciples of non-violence are objectives that have now \r\nbecome ever more important.\r\nPanama welcomes the draft resolutions (A/73/L.43, \r\nA/73/L.48, A/73/L.52 and A/73/L.55) to be adopted \r\ntoday in the context of the debate under the item \r\n“Culture of peace”, as they essentially promote \r\nknowledge of, and respect for, cultural diversity in \r\nall its forms — tolerance, solidarity, equality and \r\nnon-discrimination. In that regard, and in line with \r\nthe Secretary-General’s approach outlined in his \r\nreport, my country recognizes the role that women and \r\nyoung people can play in peace negotiations, conflict \r\nprevention and especially in the consolidation of post-\r\nconflict processes.\r\nAs a multi-ethnic and multicultural country, \r\nPanama has unwavering respect for cultural and \r\nreligious diversity, as well as for intercultural and \r\ninterreligious dialogue, and it is with that vision that in \r\nJanuary next year we are honoured to be hosting World \r\nYouth Day, to be attended by Pope Francis. Panama will \r\nopen its doors to receive young people from all over the \r\nworld in the quest to achieve our shared and paramount \r\nobjective of a culture of peace, thereby overcoming \r\nreligious and cultural barriers.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate Panama’s \r\ncommitment to observing human rights, the security \r\nand freedom of the individual, the promotion of conflict \r\nprevention, peace and security and engagement in \r\ndialogue and consensus-building as true catalysts for \r\nthe promotion of a culture of tolerance and peace.\r\nMr. Mamdouhi (Islamic Republic of Iran): I would \r\nfirst like to commend the President and her predecessors \r\nfor effectively pursuing the implementation of \r\nthis important mandate, with which she has been \r\nentrusted by General Assembly resolutions, to further \r\nfollowing up on realizing a culture of peace, promoting \r\nmultilateralism and contributing to establishing a world \r\nagainst violence and violent extremism.\r\nA/73/PV.51 12/12/2018\r\n16/24 18-43387\r\nThis kind of meeting undoubtedly provides us \r\nwith an unparalleled opportunity to consider urgent \r\nchallenges and highlight emerging trends that have an \r\nimpact on the realization of a culture of peace, enable \r\nstakeholders to exchange views on how to further \r\npromote and sustain peace through multilateralism and \r\nfind further sound and decent solutions to the existing \r\nchallenges in that regard.\r\nWe align ourselves with the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of Venezuela on behalf of \r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries (NAM), \r\nespecially NAM’s proposal to designate an international \r\nday of multilateralism and diplomacy for peace. I \r\nwould like to briefly highlight a number of issues of \r\nparticular importance.\r\nWe are witnessing how the current global scenario \r\npresents great challenges in the areas of peace and \r\nsecurity. Existing, new and emerging threats and \r\nchallenges at the international and regional levels \r\ncontinue to impede efforts by States to promote peace \r\nand security. Undoubtedly, one of those major threats is \r\na growing resort to unilateralism.\r\nToday, as the Secretary-General has rightly said, \r\nthe world order is increasingly chaotic, democratic \r\nprinciples are under siege, the rule of law is being \r\nundermined and multilateralism is under fire, precisely \r\nwhen we need it most. In fact, unilaterally imposed \r\nmeasures, the use or threat of use of force and unilateral \r\ncoercive sanctions as a means to achieve national policy \r\nobjectives have emerged in the wake of obvious failings \r\nin the multilateral system and equitable world order.\r\nMoreover, the launching of unilateral military \r\ninvasions, a willingness to ignore historical facts on the \r\nground and the rising threats of terrorism and violent \r\nextremism, which are the root causes of every crisis in \r\nthe Middle East, are the sum effects of unilateralism. It \r\ncannot be ignored that withdrawing from international \r\norganizations, especially UNESCO and the Human \r\nRights Council, as well as from international \r\nagreements such as the Paris Climate Change \r\nAgreement and the Iran nuclear deal, are among other \r\ntypical instances of a me-first, self-centred policy that \r\nf lows from unilateralism.\r\nThreatening States’ sovereignty, independence and \r\nfreedom of trade and investment and preventing them \r\nfrom exercising their right to decide their own political, \r\neconomic and social systems by their own free will are \r\npolicies that do not work anymore. A me-first policy \r\nmight work at first but in the end is doomed to failure. \r\nIn that respect, challenges to peace must be directly \r\naddressed at their root causes. We must therefore shift \r\nto a new, democratic and balanced approach.\r\nIf we are to handle the serious current challenges at \r\nthe global level effectively, multilateralism is not just an \r\noption, it is the only option, and of course it is a viable \r\nand realistic one. It is the only realistic and practical \r\noption for addressing global challenges collectively and \r\npursuing common international goals cooperatively. \r\nThe reason is simple. Certain transnational challenges \r\nand threats, such as terrorism, know no boundaries. It is \r\ntherefore not possible for a single country or countries, \r\nhowever powerful, to address them.\r\nWe must promote true, effective and strong \r\nmultilateralism. We must ensure that it is founded on \r\ninclusion rather than exclusion, cooperation rather \r\nthan confrontation, equality rather than inequality, \r\nthe rule of law rather than the rule of power. We must \r\nsolve differences peacefully and justly, not violently \r\nand unfairly. We must also pursue the common good \r\nof all States, not the goals of one State or group of \r\nStates. Nor should we forget that in order to promote \r\nmultilateralism, we must build on the important \r\nmilestones we have achieved, and prevent our past \r\ndisastrous mistakes and tragedies from ever recurring.\r\nWe should not allow self-centred unilateral policies \r\nto be pursued at the price of weakening multilateralism. \r\nWe cannot and should not allow that highly alarming \r\ntrend to continue unabated if we want our world to be \r\ngoverned by law and not the rule of power, and if we \r\nwant to remain a true United Nations — nations united \r\nfor peace and for saving succeeding generations from \r\nthe scourge of war. We should therefore address the \r\nchronic and emerging challenges to multilateralism \r\ncomprehensively and seriously and create a reformed, \r\nstrong, effective and reinvigorated multilateral \r\nsystem founded on the rule of law, justice, equality \r\nand accountability.\r\nGiven that the United Nations, as the world’s most \r\nrepresentative international organization, represents \r\nthe highest expression of multilateralism, our efforts \r\nto achieve a strengthened multilateral system should \r\nstart from this Organization. That is how we can make \r\nthe United Nations relevant to all people, which is the \r\ntheme of the General Assembly at its seventy-third \r\nsession, during which many world leaders have called \r\nfor support to multilateralism and for strengthening the \r\n12/12/2018 A/73/PV.51\r\n18-43387 17/24\r\nrole of the United Nations. That is what we need today \r\nin our highly interconnected and interdependent global \r\nvillage, where the nature, gravity, complexity and \r\nscope of challenges are unprecedented. That is what we \r\nneed to do together, resolutely and responsibly. It is our \r\ncommon responsibility.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to take this opportunity \r\nto emphasize that the Islamic Republic of Iran, as \r\ninitiator of the concept of a world against violence and \r\nextremism, stands ready to cooperate in fulfilling that \r\nresponsibility. We are fully prepared to play an active \r\npart in promoting multilateralism as the appropriate \r\nframework for providing sustainable methods to resolve \r\nexisting challenges.\r\nMs. Lahmiri (Morocco) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation is pleased to be participating in the debate \r\non a culture of peace, a universal value that my country \r\nis fully committed to. We note with satisfaction the \r\nannual report of the Secretary-General (A/73/391) on \r\nthe issue, and we thank the various facilitators for \r\nthe draft resolutions on it that we will be adopting \r\nthis morning.\r\nBecause we live in a world that is constantly \r\nchanging, we must adapt to it through appropriate \r\ncommon responses. The growing number of ideological \r\nconflicts and increasing intolerance, cultural \r\nisolationism, violence and extremism challenge us all \r\nand must push us to take effective collective action. \r\nMorocco considers diversity a source of wealth and is \r\ndetermined to implement innovative methods to ensure \r\nrespect for cultural and faith-based pluralism. In that \r\nregard, we have undertaken tangible action at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels. For example, \r\nat the national level we have undertaken religious \r\nreform, including of our religious education system, and \r\na review of the religious content of school textbooks.\r\nWe believe firmly that education is a key tool in \r\nensuring that the culture of peace can grow in the \r\nminds of men and women. We promote an enlightened, \r\nmoderate religious education based on the value of \r\ntolerance. with a view to preventing radicalism, we \r\nprovide an education that promotes peace. In that \r\nframework, Morocco is training imams, murshidins and \r\nmurshidats who are called on to exercise their duties \r\nin Morocco and abroad, both in Africa and Europe. \r\nThat commitment was translated into reality by the \r\nestablishment in 2015 of the Mohammed VI Institute \r\nfor the Training of Imams, Murshidins and Murshidats. \r\nI should point out in that regard that the commitment \r\nof young people and women is essential to fighting \r\nradicalization, violence and extremism, as well as to \r\npromoting tolerance and respect for others.\r\nThe second point that we want to focus on concerns \r\ndialogue, which can be local, national, regional or \r\nglobal. A culture of dialogue is essential to coexistence, \r\nand vice versa. We commend the tireless efforts \r\nundertaken by the various stakeholders, especially \r\nthose of UNESCO and the Alliance of Civilizations.\r\nMorocco is pleased to have hosted the second \r\niteration of the International Conference on Intercultural \r\nand Interfaith Dialogue, held from 10 to 12 September \r\nin Fez, on the theme of otherness. It provided an \r\nopportunity to take stock of actions undertaken to \r\nimplement the call made in Fez underlining the urgent \r\nneed there is for bringing about new ways to ensure \r\ninteraction and understanding among civilizations. \r\nDuring the Conference, King Mohammed VI called \r\nfor the implementation of a new global order for \r\npeace structured around the principles of coexistence, \r\nacceptance, plurality and difference. In the wake of the \r\nhistoric adoption in Marrakech of the global compact \r\nfor safe, orderly and regular migration, we think it \r\nimportant to stress the connection between the values \r\nof peace, tolerance and coexistence and the issue of \r\nmigration. On that issue, the Kingdom of Morocco \r\ntakes a proactive and humanistic approach based on \r\nfull respect for the rights of migrants.\r\nBefore concluding, we want to reiterate that the \r\ninternational community should redouble its efforts \r\nand continue to work for the preservation of peace and \r\nprosperity and to ensure good-neighbourly relations.\r\nFinally, on 13 September 2019 we will celebrate \r\nthe twentieth anniversary of the Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace, and we \r\nhope that occasion will enable us to have a frank \r\ndiscussion, present our tangible commitments and \r\nreflect constructively together on how we can work to \r\nadvance peace, dialogue and mutual respect.\r\nThe Acting President: We shall now proceed \r\nto consider draft resolutions A/73/L.43, A/73/L.48, \r\nA/73/L.52 and A/73/L.55. Before giving the f loor for \r\nexplanations of vote before the voting, I would like to \r\nremind speakers that explanations of vote are limited \r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nA/73/PV.51 12/12/2018\r\n18/24 18-43387\r\nMr. Bagwell (United States of America): As a \r\nmulti-ethnic, multicultural and multi-faith nation, the \r\nUnited States recognizes the importance of dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and cooperation among individuals of \r\ndifferent religious and cultural backgrounds. The United \r\nStates strongly believes in the value of programmes, \r\nincluding those of the United Nations system, that \r\nencourage a culture of peace and promote justice, \r\ndemocracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nWe welcome initiatives, including the upcoming \r\nhigh-level forum, that concretely address the root causes \r\nof conflict by promoting efforts to counter terrorism, \r\nreject violence and highlight the positive contribution \r\nof young people. We also welcome the updating of \r\nthe draft resolutions to reflect the importance for a \r\nculture of peace of preventing violent extremism. The \r\nSecretary-General’s plan of action to prevent violent \r\nextremism lays out key recommendations for concerted \r\npreventive action by the international community in \r\norder to address the underlying conditions that drive \r\nindividuals to radicalize to violence. Young people play \r\nan important role in efforts to prevent violent extremism, \r\nas well as in the promotion of peace and security, and \r\nwe welcome efforts to enhance their involvement in \r\npreventing violent extremism and promoting a culture \r\nof peace.\r\nHowever, with regard to an international day of \r\nmultilateralism and diplomacy for peace, we have stated \r\non many occasions that we worry that a proliferation \r\nof international days tends to dilute whatever value \r\nthere is in highlighting or commemorating legitimate \r\ninternational developments or urgent issues of \r\ninternational concern. We do not see that such an \r\ninternational day will have any tangible impact on the \r\nfurtherance of multilateral objectives or the cause of \r\npeace and security. Certainly it is an irony not lost on \r\nus that draft resolution A/73/L.48 is being proposed by \r\nVenezuela, which is led by a brutal regime that f lagrantly \r\nf louts its international human rights obligations and \r\ncommitments. For those reasons, we are calling for \r\na vote, and we will vote against the draft resolution \r\nentitled “International Day of Multilateralism and \r\nDiplomacy for Peace”.\r\nThe United States has always been a strong supporter \r\nof effective multilateral institutions. However, many \r\nmultilateral organizations and agreements are failing \r\nthe very Member States that they were created to serve \r\neffectively, and multilateralism should not be viewed as \r\nan end unto itself.\r\nAs United States Secretary of State Pompeo recently \r\nunderscored in Brussels, we are supporting institutions \r\nthat we believe can be improved and that work in \r\nAmerican interests and in those of all Member States, \r\nin the service of our shared values. We will continue to \r\nwork with our friends and allies towards realizing the \r\npromise of effective multilateral institutions that serve \r\nour citizens and our values. To quote George Marshall’s \r\naddress to the General Assembly in Paris in 1948:\r\n“International organizations cannot take the place \r\nof national and personal effort, or of local and \r\nindividual imagination. International action cannot \r\nreplace self-help”.\r\nMr. Grigoryan (Armenia): I would like to present the \r\nposition of the delegation of Armenia on draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.55, entitled “Promotion of interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace”. At the outset, my delegation would like to \r\nexpress its appreciation to the co-facilitators for their \r\nefforts in bringing the draft resolution to a successful \r\noutcome, as well as for their constructive approach in \r\naccommodating some of Armenia’s proposals during \r\nthe negotiations.\r\nAs a staunch advocate of the continuing promotion \r\nof interreligious and intercultural dialogue, we agree \r\nwith the purposes of the draft resolution. Our objection \r\nto the draft resolution’s twenty-fifth preambular \r\nparagraph, which refers to an event named the World \r\nForum on Intercultural Dialogue as a key global \r\nplatform for promoting intercultural dialogue, is \r\nbased on the fact that a particular Member State has \r\ndeveloped a tradition of abusing various international \r\nforums, especially those organized in its country, \r\nthereby distorting the principles of international law \r\nand the basic elements of peaceful conflict resolution \r\nwhile disseminating hate speech at the State level.\r\nIn that regard, we regret that the event referred to \r\nin the draft resolution, which was aimed at promoting \r\nmultilateralism and intercultural dialogue, was \r\nmisused by the country that hosted it to manipulate an \r\ninternational gathering aand turn it into an instrument \r\nof propaganda. We firmly believe that in organizing \r\ninternational events on multilateralism, intercultural \r\ndialogue and the promotion of peace, due regard should \r\nalso be given to the record of the host country in \r\nterms of adherence to human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law, as well as to the protection of cultural \r\nheritage of historical and religious significance.\r\n12/12/2018

A/73/L.55, entitled \r\n“Promotion of interreligious and intercultural dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace ”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to \r\nannounce that, since the submission of the document, \r\nthe following countries have become sponsors of \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.55: Austria, Bangladesh, \r\nBenin, Brunei Darussalam, Burkina Faso, Burundi, \r\nCambodia, Cameroon, Chad, Djibouti, Ecuador, \r\nEritrea, Guinea,

\r\nSuriname, Timor-Leste, Togo, Turkey, Uzbekistan and \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly wishes to adopt draft resolution A/73/L.55?\r\nDraft resolution A/73/L.55 was adopted \r\n(resolution 73/129).\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor to \r\nthose wishing to speak in explanation of vote or position \r\non the resolutions just adopted, I would like to remind \r\ndelegations that explanations are limited to 10 minutes \r\nand should be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Charwath (Austria): I have the honour of \r\nspeaking on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\ncandidate countries the former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania, the country \r\nof the Stabilization and Association Process and \r\npotential candidate Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well \r\nas the Republic of Moldova, align themselves with \r\nthis statement.\r\nI would first like to explain our vote on resolution \r\n73/127, on the International Day of Multilateralism and \r\nDiplomacy for Peace. At a time when the rules-based \r\ninternational order is being increasingly challenged, \r\nwe attach great importance to reiterating our collective \r\nsupport for multilateralism, building on the strong call \r\nto promote the multilateral system made by our leaders \r\nat the general debate in September.\r\nEurope’s commitment to multilateralism, with the \r\nUnited Nations at its core, is based on our values and \r\nbeliefs, but it is also an act of realism. Today’s complex \r\nthreats require complex, articulated responses. \r\nOnly together can we have a real impact in ensuring \r\nsustainable development, peace and security and the \r\nuniversal promotion and protection of human rights. \r\nOnly together can we achieve education for all, gender \r\nequality and our commitment to leaving no one behind.\r\nThe European Union is a staunch supporter of \r\ndialogue and cooperation. That is why we will continue \r\nto defend multilateral diplomacy and its achievements, \r\nfrom the Iran nuclear deal to the Paris Agreement on \r\n12/12/2018 A/73/PV.51\r\n18-43387 21/24\r\nClimate Change, and to support the essential work \r\nof all United Nations programmes and agencies. \r\nWe welcome the efforts of the facilitators to try to \r\naccommodate the EU’s concerns during negotiations \r\non the draft resolution, during which the EU expressed \r\nits view that as a general principle it is not in favour \r\nof the multiplication of international days. The most \r\neffective way to promote multilateralism lies in our \r\ncommitments and actions.\r\nIn addition, we continue to believe that the singling \r\nout of one international grouping in a resolution goes \r\nagainst the principle of multilateralism. We note that the \r\npolitical declaration of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries, as referred to in the resolution, also contains \r\nelements that are not conducive to multilateralism. \r\nHowever, in the spirit of dialogue and cooperation to \r\nwhich we just referred, and taking into account the \r\noverarching theme of the resolution, we decided to vote \r\nin favour of it. We remain ready to engage constructively \r\nwith all partners in pursuing a consensus approach in \r\nsupport of multilateralism.\r\nI would now like to turn to resolution 73/128, on \r\nenlightenment and religious tolerance. The European \r\nUnion was founded on the values of non-discrimination, \r\ntolerance and respect for human rights, including \r\nfreedom of expression and freedom of thought, \r\nconscience and religion or belief. Furthermore, \r\npromoting and protecting freedom of religion or \r\nbelief as a universal human right, and eliminating \r\ndiscrimination on the basis of religion or belief, are \r\nkey priorities of the European Union’s human rights \r\npolicy. For those reasons, the EU has for a number of \r\nyears been the main sponsor of the annual resolution on \r\nfreedom of religion or belief.\r\nThe EU has always acknowledged the great value \r\nand crucial role of education in promoting mutual \r\nunderstanding, tolerance, non-discrimination and \r\nrespect in all matters relating to freedom of religion \r\nor belief, which is highlighted both in this year’s draft \r\nresolution on freedom of religion or belief (A/73/589/\r\nAdd.2) and in our guidelines on the promotion and \r\nprotection of freedom of religion or belief.\r\nIn that regard, we welcome the focus of resolution \r\n73/128 on education as a tool for promoting religious \r\ntolerance, and we continue to support efforts by States \r\nto encourage a wider knowledge in society at large of \r\nthe diversity of religions and beliefs and of the history, \r\ntraditions, languages and cultures of the various \r\nreligious minorities existing within their jurisdiction. \r\nWe also appreciated the open and collaborative \r\nnegotiation process on the draft text, which we believe \r\nis positively reflected in resolution 73/128, and we \r\nwould like to thank the delegation of Uzbekistan for its \r\nopen and constructive approach. However, the EU does \r\nnot support the proliferation of resolutions as a general \r\nprinciple and was not therefore in a position to sponsor \r\nthe resolution, whose theme is already covered at \r\nlength in existing resolutions. Nevertheless, we remain \r\nstrongly committed to promoting efforts to combat \r\nreligious intolerance, and for that reason the States \r\nmembers of the European Union joined the consensus \r\non resolution 73/128.\r\nMr. Bagwell (United States of America): With \r\nregard to the adoption of resolution 73/129, on \r\nthe promotion of interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace, \r\nand resolution 73/128, on enlightenment and religious \r\ntolerance, the United States firmly supports efforts to \r\npromote interreligious and intercultural dialogue and \r\ncooperation. However, while we joined the consensus \r\non those resolutions, we would like to take this \r\nopportunity to clarify some important points.\r\nThe United States strongly supports freedom \r\nof expression and freedom of religion or belief. We \r\noppose any attempts to unduly limit the exercise of \r\nthose fundamental freedoms, and therefore dissociate \r\nourselves from the new text negotiated in this year’s \r\nresolutions that suggests that the protections for \r\nfreedom of expression and freedom of religion or \r\nbelief are at odds with each other. We strongly believe \r\nthat protecting freedom of religion and freedom of \r\nexpression promotes mutual respect and pluralism and \r\nis essential to human dignity and a robust civil society. \r\nWe firmly believe that all people should be free to choose \r\nand practice their faith, based on the persuasion of the \r\nmind and heart. Freedom of religion plays an important \r\nsocietal role and is crucial to the creation of tolerant \r\nand respectful societies in which negative stereotypes \r\ncarry little meaning. Rather than seeking restrictions \r\non self-expression in order to deal with intolerance, the \r\nUnited States advocates robust protections for speech, \r\nas well as the enforcement of appropriate legal regimes \r\ndealing with discriminatory acts and hate crimes.\r\nThe United States strongly believes in working \r\ntogether to build a more secure and peaceful world \r\nthrough the promotion of justice, democracy, human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. With regard to calls \r\nA/73/PV.51 12/12/2018\r\n22/24 18-43387\r\nfor moderation, we are concerned about the possibility \r\nthat the implementation of moderation-focused \r\nprogrammes and policies could be subject to abuse. \r\nWe are particularly concerned that such programmes \r\nand policies could undermine people’s enjoyment of \r\nfreedom of expression and thought, conscience and \r\nreligion or belief.\r\nWith regard to the references in resolution 73/128 to \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we have \r\naddressed our concerns regarding such references in a \r\ngeneral explanation of position delivered in the Second \r\nCommittee on 8 November and in an explanation of \r\nposition in the General Assembly (see A/73/PV.44) \r\nregarding resolution 73/24, entitled “Sport as an enabler \r\nof sustainable development”, which was adopted on \r\n3 December under agenda item 12.\r\nMr. Margaryan (Armenia): I would like to \r\npresent our position on resolution 73/127, entitled \r\n“International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy \r\nfor Peace”. Armenia would like to reiterate its support \r\nand commitment to multilateralism as an effective \r\ninstrument for addressing the complex issues relating \r\nto the challenges that the world is facing today. We \r\nrecognize the importance of multilateralism and \r\ndiplomacy in advancing sustainable development, \r\npeace and security and human rights. Restoring our \r\nhumanity, sustaining peace and respecting human \r\ndignity are important priorities that can be achieved only \r\nthrough concerted efforts and a coordinated response. \r\nWe should all collectively do more to help mitigate \r\nsituations involving crises in which basic human rights, \r\nincluding the right to life, are increasingly challenged, \r\nand that require a stronger emphasis on the capacity of \r\nmultilateral institutions to deliver an adequate response.\r\nThe date of 24 April, designated by the Movement \r\nof Non-Aligned Countries to mark the International \r\nDay of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, has \r\ncrucial significance for Armenia and the Armenian \r\npeople, as it holds important meaning and touches on \r\nspecial sensitivities for all Armenians. It is the day \r\nwhen the Armenian people and their friends around \r\nthe world pay tribute to the memory of the victims \r\nof the Armenian genocide. The Armenian genocide \r\nis a stark case in point in the argument for promoting \r\nand fostering prevention and upholding collective \r\nfaith in the fundamental human rights and the dignity \r\nand the worth of the human person. It is a reminder \r\nthat impunity fosters the recurrence of crime. It \r\nalso illustrates what happened 100 years ago in the \r\nabsence of effective multilateral institutions, when the \r\ninternational community failed to provide any adequate \r\nresponse or international protection.\r\nToday, as a State, Armenia has a duty to work within \r\nmultilateral cooperative frameworks to prevent future \r\natrocities. Armenia is resolved to continue to contribute \r\nto multilateral efforts to advance prevention, including \r\nthe prevention of identity-based discrimination, mass \r\natrocities and the crime of genocide, as an important \r\nfunction of the United Nations. The adoption in 2015 \r\nof resolution 69/323, designating 9 December as the \r\nInternational Day of Commemoration and Dignity \r\nof the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the \r\nPrevention of This Crime, was a powerful manifestation \r\nof responsible multilateralism. And this year marks the \r\nseventieth anniversary of Convention on the Prevention \r\nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, which is yet \r\nanother milestone in our reaffirmation of our collective \r\ndetermination to fight impunity and prevent any \r\nrecurrence of human suffering.\r\nWe hope that the designation of the International \r\nDay of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace will \r\nbecome an important contribution to enhancing global \r\ncooperation for peace, development and human rights \r\nat the national and global levels.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote or position.\r\nThe representative of Azerbaijan has asked to \r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply. I would like to \r\nremind members that statements in exercise of the right \r\nof reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first statement \r\nand to five minutes for the second, and should be made \r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): There is nothing \r\nsurprising in the inadequate and irrelevant comments \r\nmade by the delegation of Armenia at today’s \r\nplenary meeting. The fact is that the objectives of a \r\nculture of peace are alien to Armenia. Otherwise, \r\nit would not have become a uniquely mono-ethnic \r\nState as a result of its consistent policies of exclusion, \r\ndiscrimination and incompatibility on ethnic and \r\nreligious grounds.\r\nIn obstructing efforts aimed at the promotion \r\nof intercultural and interreligious dialogue and \r\nchallenging the various global initiatives to that \r\nend, solely because of its relations with Azerbaijan, \r\n12/12/2018 A/73/PV.51\r\n18-43387 23/24\r\nArmenia has demonstrated that the prospects of its \r\ngood-faith engagement in ongoing efforts to resolve our \r\nconflict as soon as possible are elusive. The Armenian \r\nrepresentative’s comments on human rights and so-\r\ncalled hate propaganda are beneath criticism. The \r\nrelevant United Nations bodies and other international \r\norganizations have more than once expressed serious \r\nconcern about the spirit of intolerance prevailing \r\nin Armenia. I am confident that the international \r\ncommunity would be more interested in hearing from \r\nthe delegation of Armenia about the real problems that \r\nthe country and its people are facing in the political, \r\neconomic, social and humanitarian spheres than its \r\ncomments on human rights and democracy elsewhere.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded its consideration of agenda item 15.\r\nAgenda item 116 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and \r\nother elections\r\n(a) Election of members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/73/608)\r\nThe Acting President: Pursuant to General \r\nAssembly decision 42/450, of 17 December 1987, and \r\nupon their nomination by the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, the Assembly elects the members of the \r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination.\r\nThe Assembly has before it document A/73/608, \r\nwhich contains the nominations by the Economic and \r\nSocial Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee \r\nthat will occur as a result of the expiration, on \r\n31 December 2018, of the terms of office of Argentina, \r\nFrance, Peru, the Russian Federation, the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe.\r\nThose States are eligible for immediate re-election. \r\nI should like to remind members that after 1 January \r\n2019, the following States will remain members of the \r\nCommittee: Bangladesh, Belarus, Botswana, Brazil, \r\nBulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Chile, China, \r\nCuba, Egypt, Eritrea, Germany, Haiti, India, the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, Italy, Japan, Pakistan, Portugal, the \r\nRepublic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, Senegal, \r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland and the United States of America. Those 26 \r\nStates will therefore not be eligible in this election.\r\nI should now like to inform members that the \r\nfollowing States have been nominated by the Economic \r\nand Social Council: Angola and Ethiopia for the two \r\nseats for the African States; the Russian Federation for \r\nthe one seat for the Eastern European States; Argentina \r\nfor one of the two seats for the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States; and France for one of the two seats \r\nfor the Western European and other States.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, \r\nall elections should be held by secret ballot. However, \r\nI should like to recall paragraph 16 of decision 34/401, \r\nwhereby the practice of dispensing with the secret ballot \r\nfor elections to subsidiary organs when the number of \r\ncandidates corresponds to the number of seats to be \r\nfilled should become standard, unless a delegation \r\nspecifically requests a vote on a given election.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that \r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on the \r\nbasis of dispensing with the secret ballot?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The number of States \r\nnominated from among the African States, the Eastern \r\nEuropean States, the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates and the Western European and other States is \r\nequal to or lower than the number of seats to be filled \r\nin each of those groups.\r\nMay I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes to \r\ndeclare those States nominated by the Economic and \r\nSocial Council — Angola, Argentina, Ethiopia, France \r\nand the Russian Federation — elected as members of \r\nthe Committee for Programme and Coordination for a \r\nthree-year term beginning on 1 January 2019?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I congratulate the States that \r\nhave just been elected members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination. Members are reminded \r\nthat two vacancies remain for a term beginning on the \r\ndate of election by the General Assembly: one member \r\nfrom the Western European and other States for a term \r\nexpiring on 31 December 2018, and one member from \r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean States for a term \r\nexpiring on 31 December 2020.\r\nMembers are also reminded that the Economic \r\nand Social Council postponed the nominations of one \r\nmember from the Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nand one member from the Western European and other \r\nA/73/PV.51 12/12/2018\r\n24/24 18-43387\r\nStates for a three-year term beginning on 1 January \r\n2019 and expiring on 31 December 2021, respectively. \r\nThe General Assembly will be in a position to act on \r\nthose vacancies upon nomination by the Economic and \r\nSocial Council.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our \r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 116.\r\nAgenda item 117 (continued)\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs \r\nand other appointments\r\n(e) Appointment of members of the Committee on \r\nConferences\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/73/107)\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nbefore it a note by the Secretary-General, contained in \r\ndocument A/73/107. As indicated in that document, as \r\nthe terms of office of the representatives of Ecuador, \r\nGermany, Ghana, Guyana, Hungary, the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran and Liberia will expire on 31 December \r\n2018, it will be necessary for the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to appoint seven members to fill \r\nthe resulting vacancies. Those members will serve for \r\na period of three years, beginning on 1 January 2019. \r\nConsequently, after consultations with the Chairs of \r\nthe Groups of the African States, the Eastern European \r\nStates, the Latin American and Caribbean States and \r\nthe Western European and other States, the President \r\nof the General Assembly has appointed Ecuador, \r\nGermany, Ghana, Guyana, Senegal and Ukraine for a \r\nperiod of three years, beginning on 1 January 2019.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of \r\nthese appointments?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to remind \r\nmembers that one seat from the Asia-Pacific States for \r\na period of three years, beginning on 1 January 2019, \r\nstill remains to be filled. I urge the Group to submit \r\ntheir candidate as soon as possible.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of sub-item (e) of agenda \r\nitem 117.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m.\r\n"
