"United Nations A/73/PV.53\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n53rd plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 14 December 2018, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Korneliou \r\n(Cyprus), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 75\r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian \r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations, \r\nincluding special economic assistance\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/73/392, \r\nA/73/392/Corr.1 and A/73/392/Corr.2)\r\n(a) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/73/78, \r\nA/73/170 and A/73/343)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/73/L.18/Rev.1, A/73/L.51, \r\nA/73/L.53 and A/73/L.61)\r\nDraft amendments (A/73/L.64 and A/73/L.65)\r\n(b) Assistance to the Palestinian people\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/73/84 and \r\nA/73/84/Corr.1)\r\n(c) Special economic assistance to individual \r\ncountries or regions\r\nThe Acting President: I will now make a statement \r\non behalf of the President of the General Assembly, \r\nMs. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés.\r\n“Twenty-seven years ago, the General \r\nAssembly adopted resolution 46/182, on the \r\nstrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian \r\nemergency assistance of the United Nations. Since \r\nthen, we have met in this Hall every year to discuss \r\nhow to strengthen the coordination of humanitarian \r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations. \r\nAnd every year when we meet we are forced to note \r\nthat more and more people are affected by conflict, \r\nviolence or natural disasters and therefore require \r\nhumanitarian assistance. This time is no exception. \r\nAt the end of 2017, another record was reached in \r\nterms of humanitarian needs, with 135.7 million \r\npeople in need of humanitarian assistance.\r\n“We are all responsible for ensuring that \r\npeople affected by conflicts, violence and natural \r\ndisasters are assisted and protected. In 2017, the \r\nfunding needed to provide humanitarian assistance \r\nto the 135.7 million people affected by conflicts \r\nor natural disasters reached a record $23.5 billion. \r\nWe are all responsible for ensuring that funding \r\nis made available to the United Nations agencies \r\nand other humanitarian organizations that deliver \r\nlife-saving support.\r\n“At the end of 2017, 68.5 million people \r\nwere forcibly displaced worldwide as a result of \r\npersecution, conflict or generalized violence. \r\nWhile it may appear to be common sense that \r\npeople affected by conflict require humanitarian \r\nassistance — whether they are obliged to f lee their \r\nhomes, are trapped under siege, are wounded or \r\nsimply happen to fall sick when a conflict is taking \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n18-43824 (E)\r\n*1843824*\r\n \r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n2/29 18-43824\r\nplace — unfortunately that is not the case, as we \r\nall well know. Civilians continue to be targeted, \r\nin clear violation of international humanitarian \r\nlaw. Hospitals continue to be bombed and \r\nhumanitarian assistance continues to be hindered. \r\nThat is unacceptable. Not only is it unacceptable, \r\nbut targeting medical facilities and humanitarian \r\npersonnel and hindering the delivery of life-saving \r\nhumanitarian assistance are also violations \r\nof international humanitarian law. And we as \r\nMember States are all responsible for ensuring that \r\ninternational humanitarian law is respected.\r\n“If providing humanitarian assistance to \r\npopulations affected by conflict, violence or natural \r\ndisasters is necessary, our role does not end there. \r\nWe also have to work together to prevent conflict, \r\nenhance the mediation of ongoing conflicts and \r\nprevent the catastrophic consequences of natural \r\ndisasters by enhancing disaster preparedness. We \r\nalso have to work on tackling the root causes of \r\nboth conflicts and natural disasters. We must \r\naddress the root causes of poverty and ensure \r\nrespect for human rights and good governance. \r\nWe must prevent the effects that climate change \r\nhas both on conflicts and on natural disasters. We \r\ncannot assume that all is well when the evidence \r\nbegs to differ. The international multilateral system \r\nrequires that we act together.\r\n“We are not here to reinvent the wheel. What \r\nI have said is neither original nor new. Previous \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly have made \r\nsimilar remarks, and I fear that future ones will have \r\nto do the same. Looking for long-term solutions is \r\nclearly key, and I strongly believe that the General \r\nAssembly, the parliament of humankind, can \r\nindeed change the pattern. We can provide disaster \r\nrelief faster and more efficiently; we can strengthen \r\nconflict mediation skills in regions that are at risk; \r\nand we can do more to ensure that people affected \r\nby armed conflict and violence are assisted and \r\nprotected and that those providing humanitarian \r\nassistance can do their job without obstacles. We \r\nmust assist and protect people when they are at \r\ntheir most vulnerable.\r\n“We have had this same conversation far too \r\nmany times. Let us change it.”\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Egypt \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/73/L.18/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Edrees (Egypt): On behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China, I have the honour to introduce to the General \r\nAssembly the draft resolution entitled “International \r\ncooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field \r\nof natural disasters, from relief to development”, as \r\ncontained in document A/73/L.18/Rev.1.\r\nAs we present this draft resolution this year, the \r\nGroup of 77 and China continues to reaffirm the \r\nimportance of international cooperation in providing \r\nassistance to countries and peoples affected by natural \r\ndisasters, in accordance with resolution 46/182, \r\nas well of the guiding principles for strengthening \r\nthe coordination of United Nations emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance, while also recognizing that the \r\nStates that are affected have the primary responsibility \r\nfor the initiation, organization, coordination and \r\nimplementation of humanitarian assistance within \r\ntheir territories.\r\nThe draft resolution continues to recognize the \r\nclear relationship between emergency response, \r\nrehabilitation and development, and reaffirms that \r\nin order to ensure a smooth transition from relief to \r\nrehabilitation and development, emergency assistance \r\nmust be provided in ways that will be supportive of \r\nshort- and medium-term recovery, leading to long-term \r\ndevelopment. It further responds to the growing scale \r\nand scope of natural disasters, stressing our need to \r\nredouble our efforts in order to build the capacities \r\nand capabilities of our communities and enhance \r\ntheir resilience and engagement in order to respond to \r\nnatural disasters.\r\nThroughout, the draft resolution underlines the \r\nimportance of taking early action with a view to \r\nminimizing and mitigating the consequences that \r\nmight result from natural disasters. It encourages \r\nthe increased efforts and engagement of the private \r\nsector in disaster risk-management activities and \r\nhumanitarian assistance. It also encourages us to step \r\nup our efforts to mobilize predictable and multi-year \r\nsupport to work collectively towards common results in \r\norder to reduce needs, risk and vulnerability, as well as \r\nto mobilize additional resources through anticipatory \r\napproaches to financing. It attaches great importance \r\nto addressing the full spectrum of natural disasters, \r\nfrom early action to reconstruction efforts, with the \r\ngoal of better rebuilding our communities and leading \r\nto the achievement of sustainable development.\r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 3/29\r\nFinally, the Group would like to thank the \r\ndelegation of Morocco for coordinating the negotiations \r\nof this draft resolution on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China. We also appreciate the constructive spirit \r\nand invaluable support shown by all Member States \r\nin arriving at a final text. It is our hope that the draft \r\nresolution will be adopted by consensus once again at \r\nthis seventy-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Austria to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.51.\r\nMr. Kickert (Austria): On behalf of the European \r\nUnion and its member States, I have the honour to \r\npresent a draft resolution entitled “Safety and security \r\nof humanitarian personnel and protection of United \r\nNations personnel”, contained in document A/73/L.51.\r\nThe number and magnitude of humanitarian crises \r\nhave grown exponentially in recent years. The Global \r\nHumanitarian Overview 2019 estimates that nearly \r\n132 million people worldwide need humanitarian \r\nassistance and protection. At the same time, aid \r\nworkers have increasingly come under attack. The high \r\npurpose of their actions no longer protects them. Last \r\nyear, at least 139 aid workers were killed in the line of \r\nduty. But humanitarian work depends on those who do \r\nit. Without humanitarian workers, no aid is possible. \r\nThe equation is simple, yet that simplicity conceals the \r\nmost complex and difficult task facing humanitarian \r\norganizations today, that of reaching people in \r\nneed while guaranteeing the safety of humanitarian \r\npersonnel. The international community has an \r\nobligation to those who put their lives at risk to make \r\na difference on the ground. Our speeches would be \r\nhollow were it not for the courageous and valiant people \r\nin the field who put strategies into action. We have a \r\ncollective responsibility to protect United Nations and \r\nhumanitarian personnel and to hold accountable those \r\nwho put their security at risk.\r\nIn this year’s draft resolution, we continue to \r\nrecognize the diverse and multifaceted threats and \r\ndifferent exposure that female and male humanitarian \r\npersonnel, including workers in non-governmental \r\norganizations, medical personnel and United \r\nNations and associated personnel, face in a generally \r\ndeteriorating global security environment. We \r\nfurther encourage and support all efforts to build and \r\nstrengthen partnerships, information-sharing and risk \r\nassessment among the United Nations, its humanitarian \r\nagencies and other humanitarian organizations. Strong \r\ncooperation between actors working under the same \r\nprinciples has the potential to spur strong collective \r\naction towards the prevention and mitigation of security \r\nissues in crisis situations.\r\nThis year’s text further articulates the vulnerability \r\nof locally recruited personnel with regard to their \r\nworking environment and welcomes the approval of a \r\nsystem-wide policy on the security of locally recruited \r\npersonnel. It also expresses concern about the increase \r\nin the number of sexual assaults against both men and \r\nwomen and recalls the crucial role of investigations in \r\nthe prevention of acts against the safety and security of \r\nhumanitarian personnel.\r\nLast but not least, through this draft resolution \r\nwe encourage and express appreciation for the \r\ncontinued improvements of the United Nations \r\nsecurity management system, such as the adoption of \r\na registry for victims of violence. The protection of \r\n180,000 United Nations personnel across the planet is \r\nan extremely daunting task. We must all commend the \r\nwork of the Department of Safety and Security (DSS), \r\nunder the guidance of Under-Secretary-General Peter \r\nDrennan, on the protection of United Nations personnel \r\nand associated personnel. We have to remember that \r\nno effective action is possible unless humanitarian \r\npersonnel are allowed to go about their work and their \r\nsafety is actively ensured. The draft resolution reiterates \r\nthe strong mandate and additional guidance from the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the essential work performed \r\nby DSS and the United Nations security management \r\nsystem more broadly.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nfirmly believe that it is our duty to acknowledge the \r\ncommitment of humanitarians and of United Nations \r\nand associated personnel, as well as to support their \r\nwork and do everything in our power to further enhance \r\ntheir safety and security. I want to warmly thank the \r\nmany delegations that took part in these consultations, \r\nparticularly those sponsoring the draft resolution, for \r\ntheir constructive engagement in agreeing on a text \r\nthat demonstrates our shared concern for the safety \r\nand security of humanitarian and United Nations \r\npersonnel. I would also like to thank the Department \r\nof Safety and Security and the United Nations Office \r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for their \r\nvaluable support, which informed our discussions.\r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n4/29 18-43824\r\nThis draft resolution has been and should remain \r\ngenuinely consensual, as a testimony to our shared \r\nhumanity. We owe it to the people who risk their own \r\nlives on a daily basis in order to save the lives of others. \r\nThey need the collective, unequivocal and unqualified \r\nsupport of the entire General Assembly.\r\nAdditionally, I want to inform the Assembly that \r\nwe have also submitted the annual draft resolution \r\nentitled “Assistance to the Palestinian people”, under \r\nsub-item (b) of agenda item 75. It has been uploaded to \r\nthe e-deleGATE portal and is open for sponsorship, and \r\nwe expect action to be taken on it next week.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nthe representative of Argentina to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.53.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I have the honour to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.53, entitled “White Helmets Commission: \r\nparticipation of volunteers in the activities of the United \r\nNations in the field of humanitarian relief, rehabilitation \r\nand technical cooperation for development”.\r\nSince the creation of the White Helmets Commission \r\nin 1994, approximately 300 humanitarian assistance \r\nmissions have been carried out in 71 countries across \r\nevery continent in response to requests from States in \r\nneed or to international humanitarian appeals, and they \r\nare always guided by the principles of independence, \r\nneutrality, humanitarianism and impartiality.\r\nThe White Helmets Commission is made up \r\nentirely of civilians and relies on a body of national and \r\ninternational volunteers who develop their activities \r\non the basis of cooperation, solidarity and community \r\nparticipation. It is based on a bilateral and multilateral \r\ncooperative network, through which it coordinates \r\nimmediate responses to disaster situations and complex \r\nemergencies and contributes to disaster risk reduction \r\nand response and recovery efforts. The White Helmets \r\nCommission maintains perspectives on gender and \r\non the needs of girls, young people, the elderly and \r\npeople with disabilities, promoting the provision of \r\nhumanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations \r\nand cooperation in building communities that are \r\nmore resilient in the face of disasters, including those \r\ngenerated or aggravated by climate change.\r\nThis draft resolution includes a number of \r\ninnovations by comparison to the previous version, \r\nadopted by the Assembly at its seventieth session \r\n(resolution 70/105), including with regard to multilateral \r\ninternational agreements such as the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the Sendai Framework for \r\nDisaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. It also recognizes \r\nthe importance of ensuring that the public and private \r\nsectors and civil-society organizations, as well as the \r\nacademic world and scientific and research institutions, \r\ncollaborate more closely in disaster risk management.\r\nIn 2019 it will be 25 years since the General \r\nAssembly recognized and endorsed the White Helmets \r\nthrough its adoption of resolution 49/139 B. Argentina’s \r\ncontinued commitment to humanitarian assistance is \r\nhighlighted by its convening of the regional meeting \r\non humanitarian assistance mechanisms, to be held in \r\nBuenos Aires next June. For Argentina, it is important \r\nto emphasize the special significance of the General \r\nAssembly’s approval for the renewal of support to \r\nthe White Helmets Commission, given that along \r\nwith the protection and promotion of human rights, \r\nhumanitarian management is a priority element of our \r\npolitical commitments at the international level.\r\nFinally, I would like to thank the more than 80 \r\ncountries that have sponsored the draft resolution in \r\na sign of international support for the White Helmets \r\nCommission initiative.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Sweden to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.61.\r\nMs. Schoulgin Nyoni (Sweden): On behalf of its \r\nmore than 100 sponsors, it is my great privilege to \r\nintroduce to the General Assembly this year’s draft \r\nresolution on the strengthening of the coordination \r\nof emergency humanitarian assistance of the United \r\nNations (A/73/L.61), the so-called humanitarian \r\nomnibus resolution.\r\nThis year marks the twenty-seventh anniversary of \r\nthe landmark resolution 46/182, introduced and adopted \r\nin December 1991, which created the very foundations \r\nof today’s United Nations humanitarian system. Sweden \r\nhas facilitated the negotiations on the resolution ever \r\nsince. Humanitarian needs have grown exponentially \r\nin recent years because of war, protracted conflicts, \r\nnatural disasters and the effects of climate change. But \r\nthe goal of our collective efforts remains the same as it \r\nwas set out on that day in December 1991, to effectively \r\ncome to the aid of our fellow women and men affected \r\nby crises. That is why we are here today. Thanks to \r\nthe constructive engagement of all delegations, this \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 5/29\r\nyear’s negotiations have resulted in several important \r\nimprovements, reinforcements and adaptations. Today \r\nI will give just three examples.\r\nFirst, we have strengthened the language on \r\ninternational humanitarian law, and not least on the \r\nsafety and security of medical personnel and medical \r\ncare in armed conflict, which are key priority issues for \r\nSweden and many other countries.\r\nSecondly, we have reinforced the provisions \r\non sexual and gender-based violence and on sexual \r\nexploitation and abuse. The draft resolution now firmly \r\nputs victims and survivors of such violence at the core \r\nof response efforts and makes clear that the perpetrators \r\nmust be held accountable.\r\nFinally, we have taken a major step forward with \r\nregard to the fight against food insecurity and the risk \r\nof famine. Echoing Security Council resolution 2417 \r\n(2018), of 24 May 2018, for which Sweden was one \r\nof the penholders, the draft resolution now explicitly \r\nand strongly condemns the use of the starvation of \r\ncivilians as a method of warfare, a practice prohibited \r\nby international humanitarian law. This year’s draft \r\nalso stresses the interdependency and importance of \r\npartnerships between different forms of humanitarian \r\nassistance and the importance of the nexus between \r\nshorter-term humanitarian efforts, longer-term \r\ninvestments in sustainable development and our \r\ncommon responsibility to build, keep and sustain peace.\r\nThe draft resolution that I am proud to present \r\nhere today is the result of the dedicated work of many \r\nMember States, large and small, including countries \r\nproviding humanitarian assistance and those receiving \r\nit; countries prone to natural disasters and those \r\nwith lessons on how to avoid them or mitigate their \r\nimpact; and countries that have suffered violence and \r\narmed conflict, forcing people to f lee, and countries \r\ngenerously hosting those in need of protection. I am \r\nextremely pleased to once again report a very large \r\nnumber of sponsors for the omnibus resolution — I \r\nbelieve that there are about 101 now — with strong cross-\r\nregional support. This broad and diverse ownership \r\ndemonstrates the truly global nature of humanitarian \r\nsolidarity. It is through our collective action and \r\nsupport that we will succeed in improving the global \r\nhumanitarian system and ultimately provide relief to \r\nthose who need it the most.\r\nFinally, I would like to underline that the General \r\nAssembly’s adoption by consensus of the humanitarian \r\nomnibus draft resolution, as well as the draft \r\nresolutions on natural disasters, safety and security and \r\nthe White Helmets Commission, sends an important \r\nmessage to the United Nations system and the wider \r\nworld about our collective commitment to an effective \r\nhumanitarian response system. It is important that we \r\nsend this message and that we do so together, as the \r\nUnited Nations, and I call on all Member States to \r\ncontinue to support this draft resolution and our 27-\r\nyear tradition of consensus.\r\nMs. Tang (Singapore): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the 10 States members of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). We thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive reports \r\non current efforts and the progress made towards \r\nstrengthening the coordination of humanitarian \r\nassistance, as well as the trends and challenges in the \r\nglobal humanitarian landscape. We note in particular \r\nthe continued challenges that the United Nations \r\nhumanitarian system faces in ensuring the effective \r\nand efficient delivery of humanitarian assistance with \r\noverstretched capacities and resources.\r\nASEAN would like to take this opportunity to join \r\nothers in commending the work of the United Nations \r\nsystem, in particular the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs, in coordinating and providing \r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief assistance, often in \r\nthe most difficult situations. In that connection, we \r\nencourage the United Nations system to strengthen \r\npartnerships with regional organizations in order to \r\neffectively provide humanitarian assistance while \r\nadhering to the principles of neutrality, humanity, \r\nimpartiality and independence.\r\nThe ASEAN region is experiencing a rise in \r\ncomplex emergencies and human-induced disasters \r\nand is also highly vulnerable to the adverse effects \r\nof climate change. The effects of those disasters risk \r\nreversing the gains made towards the realization of \r\nASEAN’s Community Vision 2025 and the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. Building an ASEAN \r\ncommunity that is safer and more resilient in the face \r\nof disaster is therefore a key priority for our region. \r\nOur strategy and vision for that goal are anchored in the \r\nASEAN Vision 2025 on disaster management and the \r\nASEAN Declaration on One ASEAN, One Response, \r\nwhereby ASEAN works to respond to disasters as one \r\nin the region and outside.\r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n6/29 18-43824\r\nAt the core of those efforts is the ASEAN \r\nCoordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on \r\nDisaster Management, the AHA Centre, which serves as \r\nthe primary coordinating body on disaster management \r\nand emergency response. Over the past seven years, the \r\nAHA Centre has played a critical role in facilitating \r\nASEAN’s collective response to 30 emergencies. Most \r\nrecently, it has responded to multiple natural disasters \r\nin the region and provided assistance to communities \r\naffected by Tropical Storm Son-Tinh and f looding in \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Myanmar, \r\nTyphoon Mangkhut in the northern Philippines, the \r\nLombok earthquake in Indonesia and the earthquake \r\nand tsunami in Indonesia’s Central Sulawesi province. \r\nASEAN member States have also coordinated and \r\ncontributed humanitarian assistance through the \r\nAHA Centre to other emergencies in the region. The \r\nAHA Centre mobilizes the regional stockpile under \r\nASEAN’s disaster emergency logistics system and \r\ncoordinates with various partners and stakeholders to \r\nprovide additional support to communities affected by \r\ndisasters, such as through the rapid deployment of the \r\nASEAN’s emergency response and assessment team to \r\nsupport rapid assessments on the ground and facilitate \r\nASEAN’s response and international assistance to \r\naffected areas.\r\nBeyond ASEAN, we are also working very closely \r\nwith our dialogue partners in the Asia-Pacific region \r\nthrough several processes, including the ASEAN \r\nDefence Ministers’ Meeting-Plus Humanitarian \r\nAssistance and Disaster Relief and Military Medicine \r\nExercise and the ASEAN Regional Forum Disaster \r\nRelief Exercise, which bring together the largest \r\nnumber of civilian-military personnel and assets in \r\nthe region.\r\nDisaster risk reduction and management also \r\nfeature prominently in ASEAN’s comprehensive \r\npartnership with the United Nations. We look forward to \r\nenhancing our collaboration in responding to complex \r\ndisaster situations through the implementation of the \r\nASEAN-United Nations Joint Strategic Plan of Action \r\non Disaster Management and increased interoperability \r\nbetween the ASEAN Secretary-General, as the ASEAN \r\nHumanitarian Assistance Coordinator, and the United \r\nNations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian \r\nAffairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.\r\nASEAN is seeking to position itself as a global \r\nleader in disaster management by 2025, as encapsulated \r\nin the ASEAN 2025 Vision on disaster management. \r\nIt is also the fervent hope of ASEAN and its member \r\nStates that national and regional efforts will continue \r\nto complement and contribute positively to the work \r\nof the United Nations system. We stand ready to share \r\nthe lessons learned and experiences gained with other \r\nMember States and regional and global partners with \r\na view to effectively and swiftly responding to future \r\nhumanitarian and disaster relief needs.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Eling (European Union): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and its \r\nmember States.\r\nThe candidate countries Turkey, Montenegro, \r\nSerbia and Albania; the country of the Stabilization \r\nand Association Process and potential candidate \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina; the European Free Trade \r\nAssociation country and member of the European \r\nEconomic Area Liechtenstein; as well as Ukraine, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova and Georgia, align themselves \r\nwith this statement.\r\nTwenty-seven years ago, on 19 December 1991, \r\nthe General Assembly adopted resolution 46/182. That \r\npivotal resolution marked the collective commitment of \r\nthe international community to helping alleviate human \r\nsuffering and help the world’s most vulnerable people \r\nin their greatest moments of need. Since then, hundreds \r\nof millions of people who have experienced the horrors \r\nof violent conflict and natural disasters have received \r\nlife-saving assistance.\r\nNevertheless, needs are on the rise while resources \r\nare overstretched and the humanitarian space \r\nincreasingly challenged. Those are the operational \r\nrealities that emerge every year as we negotiate and \r\nadopt the annual package of humanitarian resolutions. \r\nIt is therefore essential that we engage in a collective \r\nref lection on how we can best step up our joint efforts \r\nand address the humanitarian challenges on the \r\nground. It is in our common interest to ensure that \r\nhumanitarian workers have the necessary support and \r\ntools to operate in today’s humanitarian landscape. The \r\ntasks facing the humanitarian community have never \r\nbeen more daunting. It is not only the sheer volume \r\nof humanitarian needs but, most importantly, the very \r\nnature of current humanitarian challenges. The number \r\nand magnitude of humanitarian crises have grown \r\nexponentially. The Global Humanitarian Overview \r\n2019 paints a sobering picture. Nearly 132 million \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 7/29\r\npeople around the world will need humanitarian \r\nassistance in 2019. Almost $22 billion will be required \r\nto meet the needs of 93.6 million people.\r\nAt the same time, many humanitarian crises have \r\nbecome so protracted that they now seem permanent. \r\nThe average humanitarian crisis now lasts more than \r\nnine years. Such crises also take up the bulk of the \r\nresources and funding available. In 2018, four crises \r\nalone accounted for 55 per cent of all funding requested \r\nand received. More importantly, the increase in needs \r\ncontinues to outpace the increase in funding, even \r\nwhen funding is on the rise. As of the end of November, \r\ndonors had provided more than $14 billion, a record \r\nlevel of funding, to humanitarian response plans, \r\nwhich enabled humanitarian agencies to reach more \r\npeople in need than ever before, saving millions of \r\nlives. Nonetheless, even such generosity and increased \r\nengagement remain insufficient, and the funding gap \r\nfor humanitarian action is currently estimated at about \r\n$10.5 billion. Statistics do not do justice to the task at \r\nhand. The underlying factors that fuel humanitarian \r\nneeds are neither disappearing nor abating. Whole \r\ncountries and even regions across the globe remain \r\nsusceptible to fragility, stretching the humanitarian \r\nsystem to address the wider ramifications of refugee \r\ncrises, protracted displacement and the vulnerabilities \r\nof internally displaced persons (IDPs), further amplified \r\nby conflicts, food insecurity and climate change.\r\nIf the international community is genuinely \r\ninterested in preventing and addressing humanitarian \r\nemergencies, we have no choice but to acknowledge that \r\nthe majority of today’s crises are man-made. In 2019, \r\nconflicts are projected to remain the main drivers of \r\nhumanitarian needs. Protracted violence will continue \r\nto negatively affect human development indicators, \r\nincluding levels of poverty, malnutrition, access to \r\nessential services and social rights. In addition to the \r\ntragic human costs of violence, conflicts lead to people \r\nf leeing their homes. The number of persons displaced \r\nby conflict has continually increased in recent years, \r\nwith more than 68.5 million people forcibly displaced \r\nby 2018. While many f lee violence or persecution across \r\nborders, in the majority of cases forcible displacements \r\noccur internally. With forced displacements lasting \r\non average several years, IDPs are often particularly \r\nvulnerable where meeting their most basic needs is \r\nconcerned. Furthermore, conflicts are increasingly a \r\nleading cause of hunger. Conflict situations undermine \r\nfood security in multiple ways and create severe access \r\nproblems for humanitarian actors, who often struggle \r\nto reach those most in need. If starvation is used as \r\na method of warfare, it constitutes a grave violation \r\nof international humanitarian law, which the EU \r\ncondemns in the strongest terms.\r\nFinally, we continue to witness how international \r\nhumanitarian law is disregarded by parties to conflicts \r\non an almost daily basis, with disastrous consequences. \r\nHospitals are attacked and patients, doctors, nurses \r\nand humanitarian workers are targeted and often \r\nkilled. Civilians are trapped in deadly sieges. Parties to \r\nconflicts routinely fail in their legal obligation to protect \r\ncivilian populations. The consequences of conflicts are \r\ntherefore beyond devastating. The already vulnerable \r\nare hit first and hit the hardest, and they remain at the \r\nmercy of warring parties for a longer time.\r\nThis is the reality that we need to address today. The \r\nEuropean Union and its member States are committed \r\nto assuming our part of the shared responsibility to save \r\nlives, alleviate suffering and preserve human dignity. \r\nProtecting civilians, ensuring respect for international \r\nhumanitarian law and providing principled, needs-\r\nbased assistance will remain the cornerstones of our \r\ncontinued commitment to remaining at the forefront of \r\nthe international humanitarian response.\r\nWe will stay the course in 2019 and continue to \r\ndevote substantial resources and attention to engaging \r\ninside Europe and in Europe’s neighbourhood, as well \r\nas to responding to emergencies across the globe. \r\nBut rather than merely reacting to the humanitarian \r\nconsequences of disaster and crises, we will also \r\naddress looming humanitarian needs in an anticipatory \r\nmanner. Whenever possible, we want to provide \r\nhumanitarian assistance before a disaster strikes or \r\nviolence escalates. We must therefore further advance \r\nour financing to support anticipatory humanitarian \r\nassistance that enables early humanitarian action \r\nbefore crisis strikes.\r\nPrincipled humanitarian action will remain \r\nat the core of our response, whether in the case of \r\nnatural disasters or man-made crises. We remain \r\nfundamentally convinced of the indispensable nature \r\nof the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, \r\nimpartiality and independence. We will persevere \r\nin our efforts to ensure that respect for international \r\nhumanitarian law, refugee law and international \r\nhuman rights law — including safeguarding safe, \r\nrapid, unhindered and sustained humanitarian \r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n8/29 18-43824\r\naccess — remains at the top of the international agenda. \r\nWhere violations of international humanitarian law \r\noccur, we will insist on the importance of accountability. \r\nFull, prompt, impartial and effective investigations \r\nare indispensable, including through the use of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court as a court of last resort.\r\nIn the light of the global security environment, \r\nthe protection of aid workers is one of the EU’s main \r\npriorities. Regardless of whether they are internationally \r\nor locally recruited, or whether they are from the United \r\nNations, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement \r\nor non-governmental organizations, humanitarian \r\nworkers deserve our utmost respect and concern, and \r\nthat includes protection from sexual harassment in \r\nthe workplace.\r\nThe EU and its member States reiterate their \r\ncontinued commitment to putting people at the centre of \r\ntheir humanitarian action. Women, children, the elderly \r\nand people with disabilities are disproportionately \r\nvulnerable to the effects of disasters and conflicts. \r\nHumanitarian operations must take into account \r\ntheir specific needs and capacities and involve them \r\nthroughout the response cycle. The EU therefore also \r\nwholeheartedly supports ongoing efforts related to the \r\nprevention of sexual abuse and exploitation.\r\nWe must learn the lessons of past crises and pave the \r\nway for more sustainable responses. The humanitarian \r\nlandscape, increasingly shaped by protracted crises and \r\nforced displacement, is shifting. We therefore need to \r\nadapt our response. Operationalizing the humanitarian-\r\ndevelopment nexus, while taking into account the peace \r\ndimension, with full regard for the different mandates \r\nof different actors, can help alleviate vulnerabilities \r\nand reduce needs in the longer term. Humanitarian aid \r\ncan never ultimately be the solution to a conflict. We \r\nurge the international community to work on political \r\nsolutions to put an end to ongoing conflicts, which is \r\nthe only way to put an end to the human suffering that \r\nfollows in their wake.\r\nThe challenges facing the humanitarian community \r\ntoday are therefore enormous. As the General \r\nAssembly, we must contribute to its work through \r\nthe draft resolutions that we are adopting today. We \r\ndo so by further strengthening the agreed framework \r\nfor humanitarian action in draft resolution A/73/L.61, \r\nthe successor to resolution 46/182, which has been \r\nintroduced and very skilfully facilitated by an EU \r\nmember State, Sweden. We do so by recalling strongly \r\nthe importance of ensuring the safety and security of \r\nhumanitarians and United Nations personnel through \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.51, introduced on behalf of \r\nall of the 28 States members of the European Union. \r\nAnd we do so by better addressing the consequences \r\nof natural disasters through draft resolution A/73/L.18/\r\nRev.1, introduced by the representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and very ably \r\nfacilitated by Morocco. We thank the facilitators for \r\ntheir remarkable work.\r\nThe European Union and its member States remain \r\ncollectively the world’s largest humanitarian donor. \r\nThe objective of our humanitarian aid is to save lives \r\nand alleviate suffering, wherever it is found. We shall \r\ncontinue doing our part in a principled manner. We \r\ncount on the rest of the international community to \r\njoin us.\r\nMr. Lal (India): It is my privilege to deliver this \r\nstatement on behalf of India and Sweden on this \r\nimportant issue.\r\nIndia and Sweden share a strong commitment to \r\nstrengthening the United Nations system to respond to \r\nthe complex and diverse humanitarian emergencies of \r\nour time. We are deeply concerned about the fact that \r\nhumanitarian emergencies, primarily driven by natural \r\ndisasters and armed conflicts, reached a new high \r\nlast year, with more than 131 million people needing \r\nhumanitarian assistance. According to the Global \r\nHumanitarian Overview 2019, the humanitarian \r\nfunding requirement for 2019 is nearly $22 billion.\r\nThe increasing number of people who have \r\nbeen forcibly displaced as a result of humanitarian \r\nemergencies remains an area of concern. The global \r\ncompact on refugees and the global compact for safe, \r\norderly and regular migration, both soon to be formally \r\nadopted, as well as the Sendai Framework for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction 2015-2030, provide the frameworks \r\nfor enhanced international cooperation in mitigating \r\ndisplacement and reducing the human suffering \r\nit causes.\r\nWhile the United Nations agencies and other \r\npartners have made a commendable response to several \r\ncomplex emergencies, attempting to address different \r\nkinds of humanitarian emergencies with a coherent \r\nand comprehensive approach remains a significant \r\nchallenge. Greater coordination and complementarity \r\nin the efforts of the various humanitarian actors are \r\nneeded if they are to undertake effective responses \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 9/29\r\nthat are context-based and help to increase local \r\nactors’ participation. We must adopt a victim-centred \r\napproach to humanitarian responses, with respect for \r\nhuman dignity, and we must provide the f lexibility \r\nthat people need to make choices about the goods and \r\nservices they need the most. We should also continue \r\nour efforts to develop multisectoral needs assessments \r\nand build strong databases to enhance the effectiveness, \r\naccountability and transparency of humanitarian \r\naction. While the need for enhanced complementarity \r\nbetween humanitarian action and development \r\ncooperation is well understood, especially in the \r\ncontext of today’s multidimensional crisis situations, \r\ndevelopment action by national Governments and the \r\ninternational community must focus on reducing risk \r\nand vulnerability, which will help to build resilience \r\nand capacity and prevent conflict. Humanitarian action \r\nmust focus on addressing more immediate and acute \r\nchallenges while contributing to collective outcomes.\r\nThe persistent gaps in humanitarian funding \r\nfor the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), \r\nto which both India and Sweden are long-standing \r\ndonors, remain an area of concern. We call on Member \r\nStates to consider increasing their contributions to \r\nthe United Nations humanitarian assistance system, \r\nincluding CERF and the country-based pooled funds. \r\nMore non-earmarked f lexible funding is required so \r\nthat humanitarian agencies can use it as effectively as \r\npossible, thereby catering to people’s specific needs.\r\nWe are also concerned about issues relating to \r\naccess for humanitarian workers and to their protection, \r\nespecially in situations of armed conflict. This \r\nrequires special and serious attention. We welcome \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.51, on the safety and security \r\nof humanitarian personnel and protection of United \r\nNations personnel, which we will adopt here today. \r\nRepeated violations of international humanitarian law \r\nand international human rights law remain one of the \r\nmost persistent challenges in this area. The parties to \r\narmed conflicts, including non-State actors, continue \r\nto f lout international humanitarian law and perpetrate \r\negregious abuses of human rights with impunity. \r\nWomen and children remain the most vulnerable and \r\nneed special measures for their protection. We must \r\nstrengthen the framework for international cooperation \r\nin this area in order to bring perpetrators to justice. \r\nAll humanitarian actors must adhere strictly to the \r\npolicy of zero tolerance on sexual exploitation and \r\nabuse and ensure that the victims are afforded adequate \r\nprotection. We appreciate the Secretary-General’s deep \r\ncommitment in that regard.\r\nAs we work to strengthen the coordination \r\nof humanitarian and disaster relief assistance, we \r\nremain committed to preserving the principles of \r\nhumanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence in \r\nresponding to all humanitarian situations. The primary \r\nresponsibility for providing protection and assistance in \r\nhumanitarian crises lies with the countries concerned. \r\nIn addressing the specific needs of the affected people, \r\ninternational humanitarian assistance must be provided \r\nimpartially, in accordance with the guiding principles \r\nof resolution 46/182.\r\nSweden is one of the single largest donors of core \r\nfunding to the United Nations humanitarian agencies \r\nand provides significant support in tackling the world’s \r\nmajor humanitarian crises. Its overall humanitarian \r\nbudget has increased over the past five years in line \r\nwith growing global humanitarian needs. In 2018, \r\nSweden made a decision to provide the World Food \r\nProgramme, the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees and CERF with multi-year core funding for \r\nthe period from 2018 to 2021.\r\nSweden’s humanitarian assistance is adapted to the \r\nworld’s growing needs and to the financial resources \r\navailable, and it is committed to the Grand Bargain \r\non humanitarian financing. The Grand Bargain’s \r\nconcrete targets provide a vehicle for effective and \r\nefficient reform of the humanitarian system. Flexible \r\nhumanitarian funding has continued to be a top priority \r\nfor Sweden, as it enables more principled support and \r\nincreased effectiveness. Flexible funding such as \r\ncore and pooled funding enables timely, independent, \r\neffective and efficient humanitarian action.\r\nIndia continues to assist its friends and partners \r\nin relief efforts, particularly in dealing with natural \r\ndisasters such as tsunamis, earthquakes and cyclones. \r\nOur efforts have ranged from the immediate supply of \r\nrelief materials to the emergency evacuation of large \r\nnumbers of people of various nationalities from danger \r\nzones. In the past four years, India has rescued 90,000 \r\npeople, including nationals of 50 other countries, who \r\nhave been caught up in natural disasters or strife.\r\nLast year India provided $200,000 in emergency aid \r\nand $2 million for rehabilitation projects to Caribbean \r\nCommunity countries affected by Hurricanes Irma \r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n10/29 18-43824\r\nand Maria, as well as $1 million to cyclone-affected \r\nTonga, through the India-United Nations Development \r\nPartnership Fund. We have increased our annual \r\nfinancial contribution to the core budget of the United \r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East from $1 million in 2016 to \r\n$5 million in 2018. India also plays an active part in \r\nregional disaster management through forums such as \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Bay \r\nof Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and \r\nEconomic Cooperation.\r\nThe United Nations should continue to play a \r\ncentral role in providing leadership and coordination \r\nfor the efforts of the international community in order \r\nto support the strengthening of humanitarian response \r\ncapacity in a timely and cost-effective manner. In \r\nconclusion, let us not overlook the core of what we are \r\ntalking about, which is human beings. The essence \r\nof humanitarian response is to save people’s lives, \r\nalleviate their suffering and maintain their dignity in \r\nthe face of situations of natural disasters and violence. \r\nWe call on all States to respect and honour international \r\nhumanitarian law and humanitarian principles. India \r\nand Sweden remain committed to working with all \r\nparties to address the world’s humanitarian challenges \r\nin an effective and comprehensive manner.\r\nMs. Chuchottaworn (Thailand): At the outset, the \r\nKingdom of Thailand aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Singapore on behalf \r\nof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\r\nThailand would like to express its appreciation to \r\nthe Secretary-General for his reports under this agenda \r\nitem, as well as their important recommendations. \r\nWe also want to take this opportunity to express our \r\nsincere gratitude to all humanitarian personnel, within \r\nand outside the United Nations system, who have been \r\nworking tirelessly to provide the humanitarian and \r\ndisaster relief assistance the world needs. Thailand is \r\nof the view that one of our important priorities must \r\nbe ensuring the safety and security of our medical \r\npersonnel, humanitarian personnel and peacekeeping \r\nmissions around the world. We also thank the relevant \r\nagencies, particularly the United Nations Office for \r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, for playing \r\na commendable role in coordinating humanitarian \r\ndisaster relief assistance operations.\r\nHumanitarian crises remain one of the biggest \r\nand most pressing challenges of our time. As the \r\nSecretary-General’s reports make clear, the year \r\n2017 was punctuated by humanitarian emergencies \r\nfuelled by conflicts and natural disasters, which \r\ndrove humanitarian needs to a new high. It was also \r\nthe second-most economically costly year on record \r\nin terms of losses caused by devastating disasters, \r\nparticularly hurricanes, monsoon f loods and \r\nsevere droughts. In many of the affected areas, the \r\nunprecedented devastation required a more rapid and \r\neffective response than ever before. Thailand therefore \r\nattaches great importance to extending humanitarian \r\nassistance to all, particularly the most vulnerable, \r\nincluding women, persons with disabilities, the elderly, \r\nchildren and young people. We are also committed to \r\nproviding humanitarian services and disaster relief \r\nunder the guiding principles of humanity, neutrality, \r\nimpartiality and independence.\r\nThe gap between global humanitarian needs and \r\navailable funding continued in 2017, and in that regard, \r\nThailand reaffirms its efforts to help address that \r\nchallenge. We have been a consistent contributor to the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund, providing an annual \r\ndonation of $20,000 since 2012. We have also allocated \r\na humanitarian assistance budget of approximately \r\n$1 million each year, to be disbursed as needed, and \r\nwe have set up a coordinating committee to provide \r\nassistance to countries facing emergency situations due \r\nto natural disasters, through the donation of supplies \r\nand funds, the dispatch of search-and-rescue teams and \r\nthe provision of medical personnel.\r\nThailand also recognizes the importance of \r\ndisaster risk reduction in reducing human and \r\neconomic losses, and in that regard we have worked \r\nto strengthen national and local preparedness and \r\nresponse capacities. At the regional level, we work \r\nclosely with the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for \r\nHumanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management, in \r\naccordance with our commitments under the Sendai \r\nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and \r\nthe Bangkok Principles for the implementation of the \r\nhealth aspects of the Sendai Framework. We aim to \r\nensure a more comprehensive approach to addressing \r\nhumanitarian situations.\r\nThe importance of international cooperation in \r\naiding peoples and countries affected by humanitarian \r\ndisasters cannot be stressed enough. Thailand would \r\nlike to reaffirm its commitment to strengthening \r\ncooperation with all stakeholders and partners, \r\nincluding the United Nations, in order to provide \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 11/29\r\nhumanitarian assistance around the world, especially \r\nto the most vulnerable.\r\nMr. Alfassam (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): It is my \r\nhonour and pride today to deliver the statement of the \r\nState of Kuwait under agenda item 75, “Strengthening \r\nof the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief \r\nassistance of the United Nations, including special \r\neconomic assistance”.\r\nThe State of Kuwait, under the direction of the \r\nAmir of the State of Kuwait, His Highness Sheikh \r\nSabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the leader of \r\nour humanitarian work, accords special importance \r\nto humanitarian and disaster relief assistance, as \r\ndemonstrated by our commitment to helping those \r\naffected and in need around the world, in keeping \r\nwith our country’s foreign policy and what may be \r\ncharacterized as its humanitarian diplomacy. Kuwait is \r\naware of the worsening humanitarian crises, conflicts \r\nand major f lows of refugees and migrants that have \r\nled to immense human suffering, which increases \r\nthe burden on the United Nations and its partners in \r\ntheir efforts to address humanitarian and development \r\nchallenges and coordinate humanitarian work.\r\nIn support of the relevant resolutions and reports of \r\nthe General Assembly on the provision of humanitarian \r\nassistance, the State of Kuwait reiterates the importance \r\nof strengthening and coordinating the humanitarian \r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations \r\nas soon as possible in conflict situations and crisis-\r\naffected areas in order to save the lives of the people \r\nthey threaten. In that regard, I would like to express \r\nour deep appreciation and gratitude to the President \r\nof the General Assembly for her continued support \r\nin the areas of humanitarian assistance, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, human rights and peace and security.\r\nKuwait discharges its regional and international \r\nresponsibilities as a centre for humanitarian work \r\nby providing continued support in tackling various \r\nglobal humanitarian issues and monitoring crisis \r\nand conflict situations. The level of my country’s \r\nofficial development assistance is twice the \r\ninternationally agreed percentage, strengthening \r\nour humanitarian and development approach at both \r\nthe public and governmental levels. We work to \r\nfulfil a noble humanitarian mission that ref lects the \r\ngenuine principles and values of the Kuwaiti people. \r\nFurthermore, since 2008 we have directed 10 per cent \r\nof our total humanitarian assistance to crisis-affected \r\nStates through United Nations organizations and \r\nagencies. My delegation notes with concern the report \r\nof the Secretary-General (A/73/78) on this issue, which \r\ndocuments unprecedented levels of food insecurity \r\nand record levels of forced displacement, with millions \r\nof people displaced as a result of conflict, violence \r\nand persecution around the world. Syria, Yemen and \r\nMyanmar are current examples of the impact of such \r\nconflicts, crises and violence.\r\nTo demonstrate our full cooperation with efforts \r\nto develop humanitarian links between all States in \r\nproviding relief assistance following natural disasters, \r\na few days ago the State of Kuwait announced a \r\nvoluntary financial contribution of $1 million to the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund for 2019. We have \r\nalso pledged a voluntary contribution for next year of \r\n$1 million to the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees and $2 million to the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA). I would like \r\nto note in that regard that Kuwait has responded to \r\nUNRWA’s recent pleas by providing nearly $50 million \r\nto mitigate the funding crisis that the Agency is facing, \r\nwhich is another factor in the worsening conditions \r\nbeing suffered by Palestinians.\r\nIn conclusion, we express our appreciation for \r\nthe pioneering role being played by the various \r\nUnited Nations bodies and organizations and their \r\npartners in supporting and coordinating humanitarian \r\nand disaster relief assistance around the world. \r\nKuwait wholeheartedly believes that the capacity for \r\nhumanitarian action and good deeds is inherent in every \r\nperson on our planet. The staff of the United Nations \r\nand all humanitarian personnel are the foot soldiers \r\nwho give their all in performing their humanitarian \r\nactivities, and we extend to them our thanks and \r\ndeep appreciation.\r\nMs. Fisher-Tsin (Israel): Today more than \r\n134 million people around the world are in urgent need \r\nof humanitarian assistance. The scale of the problem \r\nand the depth of human suffering are staggering. Israel \r\ncommends the efforts and actions of the United Nations \r\nhumanitarian response system, working under difficult \r\nand often unpredictable circumstances. The massive \r\nneed for humanitarian aid has many causes, including \r\nnatural disasters, epidemics and conflicts, with natural \r\ndisasters alone claiming nearly 70,000 lives a year. It \r\nis crucial that Member States, civil society, the private \r\nsector, the relevant agencies and other humanitarian \r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n12/29 18-43824\r\nactors strengthen the coordination of their humanitarian \r\nresponse in order to better deliver for people around \r\nthe globe.\r\nIn 1958, not long after its founding, Israel adopted \r\nan official humanitarian aid agenda that has guided \r\nthe country’s international cooperation efforts for \r\nthe past 60 years. Israel is committed to extending \r\nhumanitarian aid at any time and anywhere it is needed. \r\nOver the years, Israel has sent humanitarian relief and \r\nassistance to more than 140 countries, saving many \r\nthousands of lives. Israel is often among the first on \r\nthe scene in the wake of earthquakes, f loods, famines \r\nand other natural disasters. MASHAV, Israel’s agency \r\nfor international development cooperation, leads our \r\nefforts in assistance and development aid. It has the \r\ncapacity to rapidly organize and dispatch urgently \r\nneeded supplies and medical assistance, wherever \r\nand whenever disaster strikes. Immediately after the \r\ndevastating eruptions of Volcán de Fuego in Guatemala \r\nin June, MASHAV organized and delivered immediate \r\nhumanitarian assistance. Following this year’s \r\nearthquake in Papua New Guinea, Israel delivered and \r\ninstalled 40 generators to communities with damaged \r\ninfrastructure. After a recent cholera outbreak in \r\nCameroon, MASHAV delivered 10 water-purification \r\nunits to help contain the epidemic. Each of those units, \r\nwhich operate without electricity, supplies the daily \r\nneeds of 500 people. MASHAV has delivered the same \r\nunits to many other countries.\r\nIsrael also built state-of-the-art trauma units \r\nin Guinea and Togo earlier this year and, just as \r\nimportantly, sent medical personnel to train local \r\nhealth-care providers in emergency medical techniques. \r\nBuilding local capacity has been MASHAV’s aim \r\nsince its inception and “train the trainer” its byword \r\nfor decades. Israel has sent search-and-rescue teams \r\naround the world following natural disasters. Just last \r\nmonth, Israel’s urban search-and rescue-team passed \r\na demanding international certification assessment \r\nqualifying it to join the International Search and \r\nRescue Advisory Group, an elite global network under \r\nthe United Nations umbrella that can be called on when \r\ndisaster strikes. Those are only a few recent examples \r\nof Israel’s humanitarian assistance, and there are \r\nmany others. Reaching out across borders and giving \r\nassistance to people without regard for the country \r\nthey live in are what Member States should aspire to, \r\nbecause seeing one another as individuals and seeing \r\ntheir needs as individual needs is the first step towards \r\nhealing the world on a global scale.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, the United Arab Emirates aligns \r\nitself with the statement delivered by the representative \r\nof Egypt on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\nWe would like to add the following points in our \r\nnational capacity.\r\nFirst, we are pleased to note this year’s call for \r\nstrengthening proactive and predictable funding \r\nmechanisms at the United Nations. Those mechanisms \r\nhave gone beyond the testing phase and have \r\ndemonstrated science’s ability to accurately and \r\nreliably predict disasters, enabling us to take proactive \r\nmeasures, intervene at an early stage, save lives and \r\ncut costs. We hope that by this time next year, those \r\nmechanisms will be applied to existing humanitarian \r\nfunds in order to support early interventions and \r\nhumanitarian responses.\r\nSecondly, we continue to note the need to develop \r\nstronger indicators to serve as effective tools for \r\nensuring that everyone in an affected area receives the \r\nnecessary humanitarian assistance. We consider the \r\nInter-Agency Standing Committee’s Gender with Age \r\nMarker a step in the right direction. We also hope that \r\nthe Committee will pursue and expand its work on age \r\nindicators and, more importantly, work to develop a \r\ndisability indicator.\r\nThirdly, we believe it is important to focus on \r\nearly childhood development within the context of \r\nhumanitarian response as a part of an integrated human \r\ndevelopment approach. In that regard, we commend \r\nthe progress that the United Nations has made with \r\nregard to the education of older children in emergency \r\nsituations, of which the United Arab Emirates is a \r\nstrong supporter in several initiatives, notably the \r\nEducation Cannot Wait initiative. We must also make \r\na huge effort to support children in their early years by \r\nproviding them with a full range of services, including \r\nin the areas of health, nutrition, learning and parental \r\nsupport. Without them, those children’s long-term \r\npotential will be significantly reduced, damaging their \r\ncommunities’ ability to transition to post-conflict or \r\npost-disaster phases.\r\nIn conclusion, my country looks forward to \r\ncontinuing to work on these issues with other Member \r\nStates, organizations and stakeholders next year in \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 13/29\r\norder to develop and strengthen coordination in the area \r\nof the provision of humanitarian and relief assistance.\r\nMr. Santos Maraver (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nSpain aligns itself with the statement delivered earlier \r\nby the observer of the European Union.\r\nEach year, this agenda item on the General \r\nAssembly’s programme of work gives us an opportunity \r\nto ref lect on the main issues on the global humanitarian \r\nagenda — humanitarian crises, conflicts and natural \r\ndisasters. Our collective contribution through the \r\nAssembly is outlined in the four draft resolutions to be \r\nadopted today, for all of which Spain is a sponsor.\r\nThe Global Humanitarian Overview 2019 notes that \r\n132 million people will require assistance next year, of \r\nwhom more than 65 million will be forcibly displaced \r\ndue to conflicts, violence and natural disasters. Many \r\nof them are living in situations of prolonged crisis, with \r\nlittle visibility. We must pay more attention to those \r\nforgotten crises, in terms of both their funding and the \r\npolitical and media attention that they receive.\r\nConflicts and other forms of violence are the \r\nmain causes of humanitarian emergencies throughout \r\nthe world. That is why, in addition to providing \r\nhumanitarian assistance, we have an obligation to seek \r\nsolutions to the root causes of conflicts and violence. \r\nWe must defend the right of women to participate \r\neffectively and on an equal footing in all such efforts \r\nTheir full participation underpins sustainability and \r\npeacebuilding efforts. In order for no one to be left \r\nbehind, it is essential to ensure that all are treated \r\ninclusively, especially the most vulnerable — women, \r\nchildren, persons with disabilities, LGBTI persons and \r\nthe elderly.\r\nWe therefore want to reiterate in this forum the \r\nimportance of the international legal ban on attacking \r\ncivilians and using starvation against them as a method \r\nof war. We also want to highlight the obligation to \r\nprotect health and humanitarian personnel working in \r\nconflict-affected areas and the need to grant unimpeded \r\naccess for humanitarian assistance. As the Assembly \r\nis well aware, we are particularly concerned about \r\nattacks on hospitals and doctors in conflict zones. \r\nTogether with other countries, Spain therefore wants \r\nto enahncethe implementation of Security Council \r\nresolution 2286 (2016).\r\nThe degradation of the environment and the \r\nconsequences of climate change aggravate the impact \r\nof conflicts. For that reason, we support the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change and believe that, based \r\non the worrying scientific conclusions in the report \r\nof the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \r\nit is essential that we take advantage of the synergies \r\ninherent in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the Paris Agreement. \r\nWe are proud to be among the States promoting the \r\nglobal compact on refugees and the global compact \r\nfor safe, orderly and regular migration, which we hope \r\nthe General Assembly will adopt next week. Spain’s \r\npolitical commitment to the United Nations and to \r\nactive and effective multilateralism is manifest in its \r\nresponse to humanitarian needs. We will continue to \r\nmake a sustained effort to increase the Spanish Agency \r\nfor International Development Cooperation’s funding \r\nfor humanitarian action.\r\nBeyond funding, we will contribute to tackling \r\nthese humanitarian challenges by using all existing \r\ntools, including our participation on the Executive \r\nBoards of the World Food Programme and the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \r\nand through the Donor Support Group of the Office for \r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs — which \r\nSpain will chair from July 2019 to June 2020 — and \r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross. In that \r\ncontext, and as part of our commitment in joining the \r\nSafe Schools Declaration of 2015, Spain will host the \r\nthird International Conference on Safe Schools on \r\n28 and 29 May 2019, which we encourage all delegations \r\nto attend.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating  Spain’s \r\ncommitment to international humanitarian law and the \r\nresolution of forgotten crises and to the provision of \r\nequal and inclusive humanitarian assistance.\r\nMr. Blanchard (Canada): I would like to thank the \r\nPermanent Representative of Spain and to say that I \r\nwholeheartedly agree with everything he said.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe scale and complexity of today’s humanitarian \r\ncrises are unprecedented. They must be met with a \r\nrobust humanitarian response that genuinely meets \r\nthe needs of the people affected. I will focus on three \r\nspecific areas.\r\nThe first is gender-sensitive humanitarian action. \r\nHumanitarian responses should continue to empower \r\nwomen and girls as drivers of change, ensure that \r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n14/29 18-43824\r\nthey have an equal voice and representation in \r\ndecision-making on issues that affect them, and meet \r\ntheir basic needs, including access to education and \r\nhealth care — which includes sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth and the rights of girls and women — as well as \r\npreventing and combating gender-based violence. That \r\nis what Canada strives for.\r\nBesides that, we were pleased to see the inclusion of \r\nnew language on the prevention of sexual exploitation \r\nand abuse in this year’s draft humanitarian resolutions. \r\nThe international community must make greater \r\nefforts to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation \r\nand abuse, including in the areas of development and \r\nhumanitarian assistance. In that regard, we commend \r\nthe Secretary-General’s efforts to implement a zero-\r\ntolerance approach in order to protect the rights of \r\nvictims of sexual exploitation and abuse. In January \r\n2019, Canada will assume the leadership of the Call \r\nto Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence \r\nin Emergencies. We are determined to work together \r\nwith our partners in order to improve the way in \r\nwhich gender-based violence in emergency situations \r\nis addressed.\r\nSecondly, we welcome the steps taken by the \r\ninternational community to combat the issue of forced \r\ndisplacement. Canada supports a comprehensive \r\napproach in responding to the needs of refugees and \r\ntheir host communities, and we look forward eagerly \r\nto the upcoming endorsement of the global compact \r\non refugees through the General Assembly’s adoption \r\nof the omnibus resolution of the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees. We believe \r\nfirmly that the global compact will considerably \r\nimprove our ability to respond to the situation of \r\nrefugees and that the inaugural Global Refugee Forum \r\nin December 2019 will be crucial to the meaningful \r\nimplementation of the global compact.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFinally, we need to increase our efforts to ensure \r\nthat humanitarian assistance reaches those most in \r\nneed when and where they need it. That must include \r\nthose in hard-to-reach and besieged areas. International \r\nhumanitarian law and humanitarian principles provide \r\nthe framework that enables us to do that. We must \r\nconsistently speak out against impediments to access \r\nand against attacks on civilians, health-care facilities \r\nand medical and humanitarian personnel, because such \r\nactions deny the provision of assistance and violate \r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nI would like to thank the facilitators of each of the \r\ndraft resolutions being adopted today for their able \r\nleadership of the negotiation process, and to recognize \r\nthe collegiality, f lexibility and spirit of compromise \r\ndemonstrated by delegations throughout the negotiation \r\nprocess. Their efforts have ensured that this year’s draft \r\nresolutions remain strong and relevant texts focused \r\non the prevailing humanitarian situations of today. \r\nCanada emphasizes its support for the consensus-based \r\nadoption of humanitarian resolutions as a symbol of the \r\ninternational community’s unwavering commitment to \r\naddressing the needs of those affected by humanitarian \r\ncrises and to honour the dedication of the humanitarian \r\nworkers who strive to alleviate suffering on a daily basis.\r\nHumanitarian resolutions address some of the \r\nmost pressing and challenging global issues of \r\ntoday, and it is our duty as a global community to \r\nensure that we continue to make progress and build \r\non previous work. We are also pleased to see a new \r\nparagraph in this year’s omnibus draft resolution on \r\nnon-communicable diseases. So far the challenges \r\nrelated to such diseases in humanitarian crises have \r\nbeen insufficiently recognized and addressed. We \r\nnote with concern attempts to revisit and remove \r\nlanguage that promotes and protects the safety, well-\r\nbeing and dignity of crisis-affected populations. In \r\nparticular, sexual and reproductive health and rights \r\nare inseparably linked to gender equality, women and \r\ngirls’ economic empowerment, poverty reduction and \r\nsustainable development.\r\nIn closing, Canada commends the remarkable \r\ndedication of United Nations personnel, humanitarian \r\nworkers and medical personnel, including international, \r\nnational and locally recruited staff, in delivering \r\nlife-saving assistance in increasingly complex and \r\nvolatile environments, often at great personal risk. \r\nTheir work is as inspiring as it is invaluable, and we \r\nremain committed to working to strengthen the respect \r\nfor protection norms that will allow them to continue to \r\nperform their life-saving work.\r\nMs. Luo Jin (China) (spoke in Chinese): The world \r\ntoday is facing persistently high levels of humanitarian \r\nneeds, owing to natural disasters, armed conflicts and \r\nprotracted crises. At the same time, climate change, \r\nfood insecurity and the global threat of epidemics \r\nhave further exacerbated the humanitarian challenges \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 15/29\r\nin developing countries. The international community \r\nmust uphold the concept of a community with a shared \r\nfuture for humankind and should seek to strengthen \r\nunity and cooperation, step up its contributions and \r\ntake active measures to address both consequences \r\nand root causes in our common effort to respond to \r\nhumanitarian needs and challenges. In that regard, \r\nChina would like to underscore the following points.\r\nFirst, we must respond in a timely manner to the \r\npriority needs of countries receiving humanitarian \r\nassistance, while respecting their ownership of the \r\nprocess. International humanitarian assistance must \r\ncomply with the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nresolution 46/182, adhere to the principles of humanity, \r\nneutrality and impartiality, respect the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of countries receiving assistance, \r\ncomply with international law and the internal laws \r\nof host countries, refrain from interference in host \r\ncountries’ internal affairs and from politicizing their \r\nhumanitarian issues, and ensure that recipient countries \r\nplay a leading role in the organization and coordination \r\nof their humanitarian activities. The parties to armed \r\nconflicts must observe international humanitarian \r\nlaw, abide by their obligation to protect civilians, \r\nhumanitarian personnel and medical personnel and \r\nfacilities and ensure unhindered humanitarian access \r\nand the delivery of humanitarian assistance.\r\nSecondly, we must invest in long-term development \r\nand enhance the capacity of developing countries to \r\nachieve sustainable development independently, which \r\nwill in turn help reduce humanitarian needs. The \r\nfactors leading to humanitarian crises are complex, \r\nand their fundamental solutions lie in the promotion of \r\ndevelopment and peace, as well as addressing both the \r\nsymptoms and root causes of conflicts. While working \r\nto address short-term humanitarian needs effectively, \r\nthe international community should also scale up \r\nits development efforts in order to help developing \r\ncountries alleviate poverty, improve livelihoods, boost \r\neducation and support efforts to implement the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nThirdly, we must enhance the capacity-building \r\nof developing countries to enable them to respond \r\neffectively to natural disasters, which are causing \r\nincreasing human losses and relapses into poverty, in \r\nsome cases wiping out in an instant what countries or \r\nregions may have achieved over many years. Developing \r\ncountries tend to suffer from inadequate disaster-relief \r\ncapabilities and resources, owing particularly to a \r\nshortage of available funding and a lack of technology \r\nand human resources. While taking into account the \r\nspecific conditions and individual needs of affected \r\ncountries, the international community should scale \r\nup its financial and technical assistance and strengthen \r\ncapacity-building at all levels in order to create \r\nsynergies and improve the disaster risk management \r\ncapabilities and resilience of the countries affected.\r\nChina attaches great importance to international \r\nhumanitarian relief efforts and actively participates in \r\nthem. Through bilateral channels as well as organizations \r\nand agencies such as the World Food Programme, the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, UNICEF \r\nand the World Health Organization, we have provided \r\ntimely assistance to affected countries in responding to \r\nfood crises, post-disaster reconstruction, improvements \r\nto maternal and child nutrition and health care and \r\noutbreaks of Ebola. In 2018, in the wake of hurricanes, \r\nf loods and earthquakes, China provided emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance to Tonga, Papua New \r\nGuinea, Somalia, Kenya, Sri Lanka, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic and Indonesia, supporting their \r\nGovernments with disaster relief and reconstruction \r\nassistance. China has also announced the allocation of \r\n¥600 million of relief assistance to Syria, Jordan and \r\nLebanon for humanitarian and reconstruction purposes, \r\nas well as ¥1 billion of emergency humanitarian food \r\nassistance to various crisis-stricken countries in Africa.\r\nChina will honour its commitments to working \r\ntogether with the international community to meet the \r\nneeds of recipient countries and will continue to help \r\nother developing countries to the best of its ability in \r\nresponding to humanitarian crises.\r\nMr. Favre (Switzerland) (spoke in French): The \r\nworld’s humanitarian needs continue to grow year \r\nafter year, as the Global Humanitarian Overview 2019 \r\nillustrates once again. The number of people who have \r\nbeen forcibly displaced, whether f leeing violence \r\nor disaster, continues to increase and is approaching \r\n70 million this year. The norms of international \r\nhumanitarian law are routinely violated, and civilian \r\npopulations and humanitarian workers are regularly \r\nattacked. Food insecurity indicators are increasing \r\nand the threat of famine is again on the rise. It is \r\nincreasingly difficult to ensure that humanitarian aid \r\nreaches populations in need and that they have access to \r\nassistance and protection. In the face of such numerous \r\nchallenges, the international community must provide \r\na strong and united response and the draft resolutions \r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n16/29 18-43824\r\nthat we are discussing today should fully express that. I \r\nwould like to highlight three fundamental points.\r\nFirst, pursuant to resolution 46/182, we want to \r\nreiterate that in all circumstances and all contexts \r\nhumanitarian assistance must be provided in accordance \r\nwith the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality \r\nand independence, in order to protect and assist the \r\npeople who really need it.\r\nSecondly, international humanitarian law \r\nrepresents the universally accepted legal framework \r\nfor the protection of all victims of armed conflict and \r\nthe provision of humanitarian assistance. It is essential \r\nto ensure that this framework is respected by all parties \r\nand in all circumstances, including in contexts where \r\ngroups designated as terrorists are active, as well as \r\nin the preparation and implementation of counter-\r\nterrorism measures. The challenges that we have to \r\nrespond to together are enormous. Access to people \r\nin need must be ensured. The protection of civilians, \r\nincluding those who risk their lives to care for the sick \r\nand injured, must be strengthened. The perpetrators \r\nof violations of international humanitarian law must \r\nbe prosecuted.\r\nThirdly, the problem of forced displacement \r\nresulting from natural disasters, climate change or \r\narmed conflict requires close coordination between \r\nhumanitarian and development actors, as well as the \r\npromotion of peace and human rights. We should develop \r\napproaches that encompass prevention, protection and \r\nresilience. Internally displaced persons in particular \r\nare too often left behind, and effective strategies are \r\nneeded to provide protection and assistance and prevent \r\nthis kind of displacement.\r\nGiven the immense humanitarian challenges we \r\nare currently facing, the progress made this year with \r\nregard to these resolutions is encouraging. We note, \r\nhowever, that the draft resolutions we are adopting \r\ntoday still fall short of what the global humanitarian \r\nsituation requires, particularly in terms of humanitarian \r\naccess and protection. Lastly, my delegation would \r\nlike to express its deep gratitude to the members who \r\nfacilitated the various draft resolutions. The facilitators \r\nhave worked extremely hard to arrive at consensus \r\ndecisions that ref lect the unity among States with \r\nregard to addressing humanitarian needs.\r\nMs. Ravilova-Borovik (Russian Federation) \r\n(spoke in Russian): The Russian Federation is an active \r\nparticipant in the area of international cooperation \r\nfor emergency humanitarian assistance. We \r\nregularly provide support to the main United Nations \r\nhumanitarian agencies and deploy rescue teams of \r\nqualified specialists to bring humanitarian assistance to \r\nareas affected by natural disasters and armed conflicts.\r\nIn 2018, Russian funding for United Nations \r\nhumanitarian agencies and direct contributions to \r\nhumanitarian appeals exceeded $80 million. We \r\nare a donor to the United Nations Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and support \r\nits role in coordinating the work of agencies and \r\nnon-governmental organizations. In addition, we \r\nprovide $1.5 million annually to the United Nations \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund, which we consider \r\na key universal instrument in financing humanitarian \r\nassistance in the early stages of emergency situations. \r\nGiven the growing need for assistance around the \r\nworld, we support the Secretary-General’s appeal to \r\nincrease the Fund’s capitalization to $1 billion.\r\nWith regard to fund-raising for humanitarian \r\nassistance, we should not fail to mention highly \r\ninnovative methods such as forecast-based financing \r\nfor positioning resources. In the course of the \r\nnegotiations on the related draft resolution (A/73/L.61), \r\nwe had the opportunity to exchange views with our \r\ncolleagues on this subject and listen to expert opinions. \r\nWe have decided to promote this method of financing \r\nhumanitarian assistance and hope that humanitarian \r\norganizations will take it on board in the near future. \r\nWe agree with the calls by a number of delegations to \r\ncontinue working on expanding and diversifying the \r\nclub of donors. We welcome the fact that a number \r\nof Arab States have joined and hope their partnership \r\nwith the humanitarian community will be a long one. \r\nWe are also closely following the development of \r\nUnited Nations cooperation with the World Bank. It \r\ncould contribute to the f low of additional funds in the \r\nlong term, but while that is certainly a positive trend, in \r\nour view such appropriations should serve the aims and \r\nprinciples of the humanitarian community and should \r\nnot be tied to the promotion in the United Nations of \r\nconcepts that do not enjoy wide support.\r\nWe have yet to assess the impact on humanitarian \r\nassistance of the reforms currently under way in the \r\ndevelopment system. In our opinion, the formula for \r\nthe transition from humanitarian aid to rehabilitation \r\nand development has not outgrown its usefulness, as \r\nsome delegations believe, and is still the best option \r\nfor planning the work of United Nations bodies at the \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 17/29\r\ncountry level. Most importantly, it guarantees a clear and \r\nunderstandable distribution of mandates and provides a \r\nso-called humanitarian space that, as we understand it, \r\nenables humanitarian agencies to adhere consistently \r\nto humanitarian principles. That is why we are not \r\nready to support the concept promoted by a number of \r\npartners of a nexus between humanitarian assistance, \r\ndevelopment, peacebuilding and human rights. While \r\ninteraction between these areas should unquestionably \r\nbe developed, we believe that mixing them together, \r\nthereby creating confusion among mandates, \r\nguidelines and resources, is counterproductive. We \r\nwould like to remind the departments of the Secretariat \r\nand humanitarian agencies that there is no agreement \r\namong Member States on the concept of a nexus, and \r\nwe ask them to bear that in mind in their work.\r\nWe also want to remind members once again that \r\nthe humanitarian principles defined in resolution 46/182 \r\nshould continue to be the guidelines for the humanitarian \r\ncommunity. We insist on their inviolability and call on \r\nall involved in international humanitarian assistance \r\nto conduct their work neutrally and impartially and to \r\nrespect State sovereignty, as the resolution mandates. \r\nWe consider the practice of using the humanitarian \r\nagenda as leverage in achieving political gains \r\ncompletely unacceptable, as we do any attempt to tie \r\nhumanitarian assistance to internal political processes. \r\nSuch efforts are inhumane and unfair to those in need.\r\nDespite all the complications and differences \r\nin States’ approaches to the problems related to \r\nhumanitarian responses, we must work to find common \r\nground. The 136 million people affected need our help \r\njust as much as they need us to be able to reach an \r\nagreement. We can solve this multifaceted problem \r\nonly in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect, \r\nwithout disunity.\r\nMr. Escalante Hasbún (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): As a member of the Group of 77 and China, \r\nwe would of course like to begin by welcoming the \r\nAssembly’s forthcoming adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.18/Rev.1, entitled “International cooperation \r\non humanitarian assistance in the field of natural \r\ndisasters, from relief to development”. We are also \r\ngrateful to Argentina for presenting and facilitating the \r\ndraft of the biannual resolution on the White Helmets \r\nCommission (A/73/L.53), of which we are a proud \r\nsponsor. We thank Sweden for facilitating the draft \r\nomnibus resolution (A/73/L.61), which we are also \r\nproud to sponsor. Lastly, we are grateful to Austria for \r\npresenting, on behalf of the European Union, the draft \r\nresolution on the safety and security of humanitarian \r\npersonnel and protection of United Nations personnel \r\n(A/73/L.51).\r\nEl Salvador welcomes these four draft resolutions, \r\nwhich we hope will enable us to continue building an \r\nefficient humanitarian response in cases of disaster, \r\ntaking into account every aspect of disaster risks, \r\nincluding exposure and vulnerability to threats \r\nand their characteristics, accountability in risk \r\nmanagement, the importance of preparing to rebuild \r\nbetter, and mobilizing investments that take risks into \r\naccount. In that regard, we would like to highlight the \r\nrole of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk \r\nReduction (UNISDR), as well as the application of the \r\nSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, as key \r\ntools in the prevention of humanitarian crises caused \r\nby natural disasters.\r\nWe also believe that aspects such as resilience in \r\nhealth infrastructure, cultural heritage and the workplace, \r\nthe strengthening of international cooperation and the \r\ndevelopment of donor policies and programmes that \r\ntake risks into consideration — including loans and \r\nfinancial support provided by international financial \r\ninstitutions — should be applied under the principles \r\noutlined in the Sendai Framework and in accordance \r\nwith the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nWe also want to highlight the reference included \r\nin the draft omnibus resolution to the call to action on \r\nand commitment to combating the adverse effects of \r\nclimate change, natural hazards and environmental \r\ndegradation, among other things, which exacerbate \r\npoverty, inequality and vulnerability while reducing \r\npeople’s capacity to cope with humanitarian crises. \r\nWe acknowledge the mention of the significant \r\nachievements of the Central Emergency Response Fund, \r\nwhich facilitates rapid responses for saving the lives \r\nof crisis victims, and we emphasize the importance of \r\nexpanding and diversifying the Fund’s income base. In \r\nthat regard, we welcome the Secretary-General’s call to \r\nincrease the Fund’s level to $1 billion.\r\nEl Salvador and the entire Central American region \r\nhave been affected by f loods and droughts resulting \r\nfrom climate change and the El Niño phenomenon, \r\nwhich according to official projections has an 80 per \r\ncent probability of entering a new cycle in 2019. That \r\nhas the potential to create humanitarian emergencies, \r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n18/29 18-43824\r\ndisplacement and even food insecurity and migratory \r\nmovements. In that regard, we want to highlight \r\nparagraph 69 of draft resolution A/73/L.18/Rev.1, \r\nintroduced by the Group 77 and China, and the draft \r\nresolution recently adopted by the Second Committee \r\n(A/73/538/Add.3) on an effective global response to \r\naddress the impacts of the El Niño phenomenon. We \r\nnote, however, that the draft Organizationmnibus \r\nresolution contains no mention of this phenomenon and \r\nits consequences. We encourage the General Assembly \r\nto keep a close eye on this issue in its discussions on \r\nboth disaster prevention and humanitarian assistance, \r\nand to further recognize the impact of small-scale or \r\nslow-moving disasters that, while they do not receive \r\nextensive international media attention, can indeed do \r\nextensive and irreversible damage to our countries’ \r\neconomic, social and environmental structures.\r\nWe wish also to highlight paragraph 60 of the \r\ndraft omnibus resolution, which calls for recognizing \r\nand addressing the consequences of humanitarian \r\nemergencies for migrants. We once again emphasize \r\nand defend the adoption of the global compact for safe, \r\norderly and regular migration, as well as the global \r\ncompact on refugees, and we call on the international \r\ncommunity to respond in a timely manner to the \r\nhumanitarian aspects of migratory f lows. We also \r\nwant to take this opportunity to commend the United \r\nNations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs (OCHA) and express our satisfaction with the \r\npublication of the Global Humanitarian Overview 2019 \r\nand World Humanitarian Data and Trends 2018, which \r\nare comprehensive, authoritative and evidence-based \r\nsources of information on global humanitarian needs. \r\nWe also note the International Federation of Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent Societies’ recent publication of the \r\nWorld Disasters Report 2018. We would like to thank \r\nall Member States actively involved in negotiating the \r\nfour draft resolutions, as well as the United Nations \r\nOffice for Disaster Risk Reduction, OCHA and various \r\nother entities and offices of the Secretariat and the \r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate El \r\nSalvador’s commitment to continuing its participation \r\nin the always essential building and improvement of the \r\nglobal humanitarian system, as well as our hope that \r\ninternational support for the United Nations system \r\nin both El Salvador and the region will be there if it \r\nis needed.\r\nMr. Haughey (Ireland): Ireland aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the observer of the European \r\nUnion on behalf of its member States.\r\nIreland warmly welcomes the Assembly’s \r\nforthcoming adoption of the draft resolutions \r\non humanitarian issues. The process leading to \r\nour agreement on them represented an important \r\nopportunity for us all to recommit to our predecessors’ \r\nvision in resolution 46/182 of ensuring more effective \r\ncollective efforts for the provision of humanitarian \r\nassistance. There have been few moments when such \r\nefficiency in humanitarian action has been needed \r\nmore than it is now. The scale of the humanitarian \r\nchallenge facing our international community cannot \r\nbe overstated. The majority of the crises we are facing \r\nare driven by conflict, which has resulted in more than \r\n65 million people being forced to f lee their homes and \r\nmillions more left in need of humanitarian assistance. \r\nWe are particularly concerned about the situation in \r\nYemen. We call on all parties to cooperate in order \r\nto achieve a political resolution to that conflict, \r\nrespect international humanitarian law and ensure \r\nunrestricted humanitarian access and the free f low of \r\ncommercial goods.\r\nWhen adherence to international humanitarian \r\nlaw and respect for humanitarian principles are \r\ndisregarded or discarded, the space for humanitarian \r\naction contracts and people die. We are deeply \r\nconcerned about the increasingly challenging context \r\nin which humanitarian workers operate. We have seen \r\nincreasing threats to the ability of humanitarian actors \r\nto function, a sense of impunity in the application \r\nof international humanitarian law, a shrinking civil \r\nspace and the targeting of humanitarian workers. It \r\nis the responsibility of every Member State to ensure \r\nthat those who violate international humanitarian law \r\nare held to account. We pay tribute today to those aid \r\nworkers who have lost their lives in the line of duty \r\nover this past year, and salute all those who work in \r\nsome of the most challenging conditions imaginable, \r\ndelivering humanitarian aid to those in need around \r\nthe world. Faced with these challenges, which are \r\noften deeply complex and protracted in nature, the \r\ninternational community has a duty to come together \r\nto assist countries experiencing conflict and to try to \r\nbuild a path to reconciliation, to prevent conflict by \r\naddressing its root causes, including climate change, \r\nnutrition, poverty and inequality and to uphold and \r\npromote international humanitarian law.\r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 19/29\r\nIreland is committed to addressing those challenges \r\nin partnership with others. We have committed to \r\nincreasing our development spending to 0.7 per cent of \r\nour gross domestic product by 2030. We are committed \r\nto ensuring that as much of our humanitarian spending \r\nas possible is unearmarked and multi-annual, allowing \r\nour partners to plan effectively and channel resources \r\nwhere there is greatest need. We also believe strongly in \r\na multilateral response and are strong supporters of the \r\nwork of the United Nations Office for the Coordination \r\nof Humanitarian Affairs and the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund. The challenges we face are enormous \r\nin both scale and complexity. It is only by working \r\ntogether that we can hope to address them.\r\nMr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): The delegation of \r\nUkraine aligns itself with the statement delivered by \r\nthe observer of the European Union, and we would like \r\nto add a few points in our national capacity.\r\nNo country is immune to the risk of humanitarian \r\nemergencies, which often involve death, displacement \r\nor destruction on a large scale. In 2019, according to the \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \r\n(OCHA), nearly 132 million people in 42 countries \r\naround the world will need humanitarian assistance, \r\nincluding protection. That is why strengthening \r\ninternational cooperation in solving humanitarian \r\nproblems should be one of the most important core \r\npriorities of the United Nations. By responding to \r\nhumanitarian disasters quickly and effectively, United \r\nNations agencies help to restore affected countries by \r\nforging a path towards recovery, growth and stability. \r\nUnfortunately, however, conflicts will continue to be \r\nthe main drivers of humanitarian needs in 2019. Many \r\nhumanitarian crises become protracted because limited \r\nprogress is made in addressing their root causes. \r\nIndeed, most humanitarian needs occur in the context \r\nof such crises. We therefore believe that political and \r\npeacekeeping solutions for protracted conflicts must be \r\nat the top of the United Nations agenda. Many modern \r\nconflicts, including the ongoing foreign aggression \r\nagainst my country, are often fuelled other States’ \r\npursuit of their own political interests. They are not \r\nconcerned about the humanitarian situation in the \r\nregions affected by conflict, and their incentive to \r\nreach a peace deal continues to diminish.\r\nUkraine is a sponsor of all the draft humanitarian \r\nresolutions to be adopted today, and my country places \r\nspecial emphasis on this topic. The almost five years \r\nof armed conflict caused by the ongoing Russian \r\naggression in eastern Ukraine have resulted in a \r\nprotracted and complex humanitarian crisis. The United \r\nNations estimates that about 3.5 million vulnerable \r\nUkrainians affected by the Russian incursion will be in \r\nurgent need of humanitarian assistance and protection \r\nover the next year. More than 1.5 million Ukrainians \r\nare registered as internally displaced persons (IDPs). \r\nThis area, according to the United Nations, is already \r\none of the most mine-contaminated in the world. \r\nThere is also a whole range of threats that could lead \r\nto further deterioration of the protracted humanitarian \r\ncrisis in the region, particularly those related to \r\ncritical infrastructure. If the Russian aggression \r\ncontinues, it could also result in an environmental and \r\nhumanitarian catastrophe, which is why the cessation \r\nof hostilities remains essential to enabling an effective \r\nhumanitarian response and the protection of civilians \r\nand humanitarian personnel.\r\nThe Government of Ukraine continues to pursue its \r\nefforts to alleviate the suffering of Ukrainian citizens \r\naffected by the Russian aggression, particularly IDPs. \r\nWe are currently focused on fixing the major systemic \r\nissues relating to the social integration and adaptation \r\nof IDPs, as well as on studying best practices for \r\nintegrating them into their host communities. In \r\nthat context, the Ukrainian Cabinet has approved \r\na State programme for recovery and peacebuilding \r\nin Ukraine’s eastern regions whose main goal is to \r\npromote the social and economic development of \r\nthe communities concerned and to strengthen their \r\ncapacities and social stability. We have developed a \r\nmodern, innovative online platform for economic and \r\nsocial recovery to facilitate the operational monitoring \r\nof projects aimed at the restoration of infrastructure \r\nand the development and support of communities \r\nin Government-controlled areas. It will enable the \r\nauthorities to respond promptly to the challenges and \r\nproblems of the population in eastern Ukraine and \r\nfacilitate assistance from international humanitarian \r\norganizations. The Government of Ukraine is also \r\ncoordinating demining programmes and implementing \r\nprojects on humanitarian demining that inform citizens \r\nwho live in areas near the line of contact about demining \r\nactivities and the rules of conduct in situations involving \r\nexplosive objects, as well as providing other assistance.\r\nUkraine is grateful for the aid provided by the \r\nUnited Nations system to millions of people in need. \r\nWe thank the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees, the World Food Programme, UNICEF, OCHA \r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n20/29 18-43824\r\nand other agencies and bilateral partners, especially the \r\nEuropean Union, the United States, Canada, Sweden, \r\nNorway, Japan, Estonia and many other countries, as \r\nwell as the International Committee of the Red Cross \r\nand other non-governmental organizations, for their \r\ncontinued vital support to Ukraine. In particular, we \r\nare grateful to OCHA for advancing its humanitarian \r\nresponse plans, which will offer a two-year planning \r\nhorizon for the first time. We hope that this approach \r\nwill meet the urgent humanitarian needs of the most \r\nvulnerable and make it possible to reduce them by \r\nfocusing on building resilience.\r\nTo complement those efforts, President Poroshenko \r\nof Ukraine has launched an initiative to mobilize \r\ninternational humanitarian assistance by setting \r\nup sponsorships by European countries of specific \r\ncities and villages affected by the conflict. The aim \r\nis to strengthen and boost their reconstruction and \r\nrehabilitation, and we call on our partners to enhance \r\nand embrace this initiative. In addition, as a result of \r\nRussia’s recent act of aggression in the Sea of Azov, \r\nUkraine has had to intensify its efforts to mitigate \r\nthe negative effects of the situation on the social \r\nand economic development of the Ukrainian region \r\naround the Sea of Azov. We would greatly appreciate \r\ninternational assistance in this area as well, including \r\nthrough active engagement in concrete projects that we \r\nhave already shared with our partners.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize once \r\nagain that no humanitarian aid can replace long-term \r\npolitical and development solutions, which are crucial \r\nfor people in crisis.\r\nMr. Kawamura (Japan): The world is dealing with \r\na trend in which humanitarian needs are increasing, \r\nin terms of both the funding required to remedy them \r\nand the people affected. The recently published Global \r\nHumanitarian Overview 2019 details, for instance, \r\nthe increasing numbers of people being displaced by \r\nconflict, the high human cost of natural disasters and \r\nclimate change, the rise in food insecurity and the fact \r\nthat humanitarian crises are affecting more people for \r\nlonger periods of time. As I said in June during the \r\nEconomic and Social Council humanitarian affairs \r\nsegment, timely assistance is needed more than ever if \r\nwe are to respond to such complex humanitarian needs. \r\nAt the United Nations summit on refugees and migrants, \r\nheld in 2016 (see A/71/PV.3 et seq.), Prime Minister \r\nAbe stated that Japan would provide an assistance \r\npackage of approximately $2.8 billion between 2016 \r\nand 2018 in humanitarian and self-reliance assistance to \r\nrefugees and migrants and assistance to host countries \r\nand communities. I am pleased to be able to inform the \r\nAssembly that our contribution has already exceeded \r\nthat target.\r\nAs we face growing and increasingly complex \r\nhumanitarian crises, we firmly believe that in order to \r\naddress humanitarian needs effectively on the ground \r\nit is important to utilize assistance efficiently. Japan is \r\nvery much of the view that the joint approach represented \r\nby establishing a humanitarian, development and peace \r\nnexus is relevant in that regard, and we hope to see \r\nmore examples of good practices in the field, which \r\nwe believe are essential for broadening support for this \r\napproach and promoting its implementation. I call on \r\nthe relevant United Nations agencies to increase efforts \r\nto activate this nexus on the ground.\r\nWith regard to the issue of natural disasters, \r\nwhich can cause humanitarian crises and exacerbate \r\nconflict situations, Japan places particular importance \r\non disaster risk reduction. I welcome the references in \r\nsome of the draft resolutions introduced today to the \r\nimportance of implementing the Sendai Framework \r\nfor Disaster Risk Reduction for the period from 2015 \r\nto 2030, and I want to emphasize the importance of \r\nintegrating a disaster risk reduction perspective into \r\nhumanitarian assistance efforts in order to prevent new \r\ndisaster risks and reduce existing ones.\r\nFinally, I would like to inform all States Members of \r\nthe United Nations that in August 2019 Japan will host \r\nthe seventh Tokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment, in Yokohama. We ask for the international \r\ncommunity’s cooperation in strengthening support \r\nfor Africa with a view to reducing its vulnerabilities \r\nand further enhancing its resilience so as to promote \r\nits development.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress once again that \r\nJapan would like to continue strengthening its work \r\non humanitarian assistance, with a particular focus \r\non humanitarian needs on the ground and effective \r\napproaches to get results and have an impact on people \r\nin need, and on placing human security action at the \r\ncentre of our response in doing so.\r\nMs. Melfald (Norway): The scale and complexity \r\nof today’s humanitarian crises are unprecedented, \r\nand we must therefore step up our collective efforts \r\non several fronts. We support the Secretary-General’s \r\nefforts to reform the United Nations, strengthen \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 21/29\r\ninternational cooperation and promote partnerships \r\nthat will deliver more sustainable solutions for the \r\nmillions of people affected by humanitarian crises. \r\nStronger partnerships between host communities, the \r\nUnited Nations system, the multilateral development \r\nbanks and civil society are critical to a more effective \r\nand accountable response. The draft resolutions we \r\nare discussing today must be an expression of those \r\npartnerships and a united response. Let me emphasize \r\nfour points of particular importance.\r\nFirst, humanitarian crises are increasingly defined \r\nby crises of protection and access. Parties to conflicts \r\noften disregard international humanitarian law and \r\nhumanitarian principles. Attacks on health facilities and \r\nschools have become appallingly commonplace. The \r\ninternational community must condemn such attacks \r\ndecisively and take effective measures against them. \r\nWe must fulfil our responsibility to protect children \r\nfrom armed conflict, including by protecting schools, \r\nuniversities, students and teachers from attacks.\r\nSecondly, we must ensure that the safety and human \r\nrights of women and children are respected. This should \r\nbe an essential dimension of humanitarian responses \r\nand a priority. We should promote the participation of \r\nwomen and women’s organizations and step up efforts \r\nto combat sexual and gender-based violence.\r\nThirdly, we must redouble our efforts to address and \r\nreduce forced displacement. With the global compact \r\non refugees, the international refugee response is \r\nundergoing a major reinvigoration. Internally displaced \r\npersons (IDPs), however, have so far not received the \r\nsame level of attention, even though there can be no \r\nquestion that the need for humanitarian assistance \r\nand protection is increasing. Strategies for solutions \r\nfor IDPs, including in cooperation with development \r\nactors, should be a main concern for the United Nations \r\nas a whole in 2019 and beyond.\r\nFinally, we must continue to increase the \r\neffectiveness of humanitarian assistance and place \r\npeople at the centre of our response. Earlier this year, \r\nNorway presented its new humanitarian strategy, \r\nwhich will form the basis of our humanitarian policy \r\nand financial support in the years to come. It includes \r\nmore f lexible funding and multi-year commitments \r\nto enable a predictable, adaptive and cost-effective \r\nhumanitarian response. We are a strong supporter of \r\nthe United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund \r\nand the country-based humanitarian pooled funds. The \r\nhumanitarian system faces enormous challenges in the \r\nyears ahead in a context of worsening and protracted \r\ncrises and constrained funds. We are determined to \r\nwork together to meet those challenges.\r\nLet me end by expressing our strong appreciation \r\nand deep gratitude to the facilitators of the various \r\ndraft resolutions, who have invested time and energy \r\nand brought Member States together to present a \r\nstrengthened and united response.\r\nMr. Hawke (New Zealand): Two years ago, when \r\nNew Zealand last made a statement during the General \r\nAssembly’s discussion of humanitarian affairs (see A/71/\r\nPV.56), we lamented the rise in global humanitarian \r\nneeds, the toll that the conflict in Syria was having \r\non civilians and the f lagrant violations that we were \r\nseeing of international humanitarian law. Regrettably, \r\nin 2018 little has changed. The world’s humanitarian \r\nneeds are greater than ever and continue to be driven \r\nby a lack of the political will needed to prevent and end \r\narmed conflicts and respect the rules of war that are \r\nexpressly designed to limit human suffering.\r\nThe human cost exacted by armed conflict in 2018 \r\nis deeply worrying. The fact that 14 million people are \r\non the brink of famine in one country alone should \r\nstrongly motivate all of us here to strive harder to uphold \r\nhuman dignity, find political solutions to conflict \r\nand commit to lasting, inclusive peace. In various \r\nrecent and ongoing armed conflicts we are seeing \r\nthe devastating effects of the use of heavy explosive \r\nweapons in populated areas. Measures must always be \r\ntaken to avoid incidental harm to civilians, or at the \r\nvery least minimize it. If the risks to civilians cannot \r\nbe sufficiently mitigated, the use of such weapons in \r\ntowns and cities must be avoided.\r\nNew Zealand remains deeply concerned about \r\nthe continuing disregard for the protections that \r\nhumanitarian personnel, including medical workers, \r\nare legally entitled to. We strongly condemn all acts \r\nof violence, attacks and threats against humanitarian \r\npersonnel, as well as attacks on hospitals and \r\nhealth facilities.\r\nWhile armed conflict and violence continue to \r\ndrive global humanitarian needs, climate change is also \r\nrapidly becoming a humanitarian issue. As an island \r\nnation in the Pacific, New Zealand is acutely aware of \r\nthe threat of climate change. The Pacific is feeling the \r\neffects of a changing climate right now, from rising \r\nseas to a greater intensity and frequency of extreme \r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n22/29 18-43824\r\nweather events such as cyclones, f loods and droughts. \r\nOur humanity should be measured not just by how we \r\nrespond to the effects of climate change but by how \r\nearnestly we tackle its root causes. That is why New \r\nZealand continues to champion the objectives of the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change designed to enable \r\nthe world to become carbon neutral in the second half \r\nof this century.\r\nIt is increasingly important to ensure that the \r\nsexual and reproductive rights of women and girls in \r\nhumanitarian settings are upheld based on this year’s \r\nhumanitarian omnibus draft resolution (A/73/L.61). All \r\npeople, including those in humanitarian settings, have \r\nthe right to sexual and reproductive health. Sexual and \r\nreproductive health care must be available from the \r\nonset of a crisis. New Zealand will always strongly \r\nadvocate for sexual and reproductive health and rights \r\nfor women and girls, because without it gender equality \r\nand women’s empowerment simply cannot be achieved. \r\nWe are pleased that the humanitarian omnibus refers to \r\nthe importance of involving people with disabilities in \r\nhumanitarian decision-making processes. In particular, \r\nwe would like to highlight the role of women and \r\nyoung people with disabilities and the importance of \r\nstrengthening their opportunities to exercise leadership \r\nand decision-making capabilities.\r\nAs we head into 2019, the global humanitarian \r\noutlook is worrisome, with ever-higher numbers \r\nof people in need of life-saving assistance. The \r\nhumanitarian system must continue to adapt to \r\nmaintain its effectiveness and strengthen its efficiency. \r\nPeople affected by conflict and disaster look to us \r\nto collectively deliver on our shared commitment to \r\nhumankind and sustainable peace.\r\nMr. Awad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): Every year we meet again to reaffirm our \r\nmoral, humanitarian and legal commitment to providing \r\npurely humanitarian assistance to all those in need \r\nwithout discrimination, politicization or blackmail, \r\nand in accordance with the humanitarian principles \r\nthat we all believe in. In that context, I want to once \r\nagain stress the commitment of the Government of the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic to its firm principled position, \r\nwhich is to provide humanitarian assistance to all those \r\nin need without discrimination while respecting the \r\nguiding principles of the United Nations with regard to \r\nhumanitarian assistance in emergencies, as provided for \r\nin resolution 46/182. I refer in particular to respect for \r\nnational sovereignty and the role of the State concerned \r\nin supervising the distribution of humanitarian \r\nassistance on its territories, as well as for the principles \r\nof neutrality, integrity and non-politicization.\r\nThe behaviour of some Governments of States that \r\nare sponsors of the Assembly’s humanitarian draft \r\nresolutions, as well as of certain officials responsible \r\nfor coordinating humanitarian assistance, foremost \r\namong them the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs, suggests that they are mostly \r\ninterested in politicizing humanitarian action and \r\nin the shameful efforts to conceal the fundamental \r\nreasons for most humanitarian crises. They also \r\nexploit humanitarian resolutions in order to interfere \r\nin the internal affairs of States, ignoring some of \r\nthe difficulties that the humanitarian field is dealing \r\nwith, including the fact that funding for humanitarian \r\nactivities at the United Nations has been reduced. All \r\nof that results in eliminating the human actions from \r\ntheir content, which forces us to conclude that the \r\nonly solution to any humanitarian crisis must first and \r\nforemost be to tackle its genuine underlying causes, \r\nas well as its repercussions, without politicization or \r\nselectivity. With that in mind, I would like to make the \r\nfollowing comments.\r\nTurning first to the issue of foreign occupation, \r\nthe insistence of certain delegations on excluding any \r\nreferences to foreign occupation as a situation requiring \r\nhumanitarian assistance in the draft resolution \r\non the coordination of humanitarian assistance \r\n(A/73/L.61) speaks to the malevolent reasons for \r\nsuch manoeuvres. It ensures that the draft resolution \r\nis neither comprehensive nor balanced and does not \r\nrespond to the concerns of most States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations. That is why it is important to recall \r\nthat Palestine, the occupied Syrian Golan and the other \r\nArab territories occupied since 1967 are still under \r\nIsraeli occupation, which from time to time results in \r\nnew humanitarian crises.\r\nMy second point is on the fight against terrorism. \r\nThe fact that draft resolution A/73/61 refers to terrorist \r\nactivities as one of the main factors in humanitarian \r\ncrises — as well as the fact that after years of neglect, \r\nsuch acts were condemned in resolution 71/129, \r\nadopted two years ago, on the safety and security of \r\nhumanitarian personnel — is an important step in the \r\nright direction. States have finally recognized that \r\nviolence, poverty and conflict are not the only causes of \r\nmigration, displacement and humanitarian crises, and \r\nthat terrorism is another fundamental factor in them. \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 23/29\r\nHowever, despite the importance of this step, it is still \r\ninadequate, because certain States continue to deny \r\nthat terrorism is the fundamental reason for various \r\nhumanitarian crises, whether the subject is my country, \r\nSyria, or other countries of our region and beyond. \r\nThe greatest proof of that is the terrorist hysteria that \r\nthe world is witnessing, which has led to the killing \r\nof innocent civilians all over the world. We firmly \r\ncondemned that and warned against its consequences \r\nlong ago.\r\nMy delegation wants to stress once again that \r\nterrorism is the fundamental reason for the suffering \r\nof the Syrian people, particularly women and children. \r\nCombating it requires cooperating and coordinating \r\nfully with the Syrian Government, which has been \r\nfighting terrorism on behalf of the world and in \r\ncooperation with its allies. We call on the United Nations \r\nto put pressure on Member States that are known to \r\nbe supporting armed terrorist groups in my country \r\nto end their sponsorship and support of such groups, \r\nparticularly Da’esh and the Al-Nusra Front, alongside \r\nany other terrorist organizations listed as terrorists by \r\nthe Security Council. They continue to be the largest \r\nbeneficiaries of humanitarian assistance through the \r\nso-called International, Impartial and Independent \r\nMonitoring Mechanism of the United Nations in \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic, which is politicized and \r\nillegitimate and has been shown to be an ineffective \r\nfailure, as well as a serious violation of my country’s \r\nsovereignty and the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMy third point is on the grave consequences of \r\nunilateral coercive economic measures. The United \r\nNations has always rejected and condemned the \r\nimposition of such measures, which are illegitimate \r\nand have catastrophic consequences for the economy \r\nof States and their peoples’ welfare. Everyone knows \r\nthat the Secretary-General issues an annual report \r\non the economic and social consequences of such \r\nmeasures. The General Assembly adopts consensus \r\nresolutions every year that clearly condemn the \r\nimposition of such measures. We also have a Special \r\nRapporteur on the negative impact of such measures \r\nwho closely follows their effects and keeps Member \r\nStates consistently informed on the illegitimacy and \r\nillegality of their imposition outside the purview of \r\nthe Security Council. Regrettably, however, some \r\nGovernments continue to ignore these facts, rejecting \r\nany reference in humanitarian resolutions to the \r\nnegative effects of such measures on humanitarian \r\nassistance. To this day such measures continue to be \r\nimposed, outside the purview of the United Nations, \r\non Syria and many other States, by the United States, \r\nthe European Union and others, despite continued \r\ncalls and demands from the international community \r\nthat they be ended forthwith. They have catastrophic \r\neffects on Syria’s economy and Syrians’ livelihoods, \r\nthey have led to hundreds of thousands of Syrians’ \r\nmigration from their homeland and have hampered \r\nboth health and humanitarian response plans in Syria. \r\nThat unquestionably runs counter to the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and international legitimacy and to the \r\nlofty goals of sustainable development that we all seek \r\nto achieve. It constitutes an act of aggression against \r\nthe welfare of the Syrian people and their right to live \r\na normal life.\r\nMs. Nemroff (United States of America): Last week \r\nthe United Nations released the Global Humanitarian \r\nOverview 2019. The facts on the humanitarian needs \r\naround the world are sobering. More than 135 million \r\npeople across the world will need humanitarian \r\nassistance next year. The United Nations estimates that \r\nat least $22 billion is needed to meet the most basic \r\nneeds of vulnerable people around the world.\r\nConflict remains the main driver of humanitarian \r\nneeds. Protracted violence will force people to f lee \r\nfrom their homes, deny them access to sufficient food \r\nand rob them of their means of making a living. That \r\nincludes situations where Governments utterly fail \r\nto uphold and systematically violate their primary \r\nresponsibility to protect the rights and well-being \r\nof their citizens. Food insecurity is also rising, with \r\nthe number of people experiencing crisis-level food \r\ninsecurity increasing from 80 million to 124 million \r\npeople in only two years.\r\nIn the face of that dire need, the United States is \r\nproud to be a global leader in humanitarian assistance. In \r\nfiscal year 2018, the United States remained the world’s \r\nsingle largest humanitarian donor and provided more \r\nthan $8 billion in humanitarian assistance globally. \r\nWhile there remain critical gaps in humanitarian \r\nfunding, we are reassured to see other donor countries \r\nincreasing their contributions. The year 2018 is on \r\ntrack as one of record-high humanitarian funding, and \r\nwe commend the spirit and reality of burden-sharing.\r\nIn addition to critical financial resources, we must \r\ncontinue to coordinate our efforts across the pillars of \r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n24/29 18-43824\r\nour humanitarian, development, political and security \r\nwork. By drawing on our reach, our inf luence and \r\nour subject-matter expertise, we work in partnership \r\nto forge effective strategies to resolve problems and \r\nadvocate at the highest level to support response \r\noperations on the ground, as well as to elevate the \r\nneeds and voices of the displaced. That effort includes \r\nour responsibility to press Governments and parties to \r\nconflict to uphold other obligations under international \r\nlaw. That also includes our long-standing work to keep \r\nthe humanitarian consequences of crises, such as in \r\nYemen, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, firmly on the agenda of the Security \r\nCouncil and to ensure that we are still a voice for those \r\noften forgotten.\r\nIn that context, through these draft resolutions, \r\nthe General Assembly can, and should, send an \r\nimportant message of concern and solidarity to \r\nthe many courageous people who risk their lives \r\nto deliver humanitarian assistance to the millions \r\nof people around the world suffering as a result of \r\nnatural disasters, armed conflicts and other crises. In \r\nrecent years, there have been far too many casualties \r\nand deaths among humanitarian personnel who were \r\nworking to reach people in need. We are grateful for \r\ntheir service, compassion and, in some cases, ultimate \r\nsacrifice. We also call on Member States and parties \r\nto conflict to comply with their obligations under \r\ninternational humanitarian law, including the right \r\nof civilians to assistance, and to take every action to \r\nrespect the operational independence and neutrality of \r\nhumanitarian organizations.\r\nThe draft resolutions that we will be adopting \r\ntoday (A/73/L.18/Rev.1, A/73/L.51, A/73/L.53 and \r\nA/73/L.61) reaffirm the vital function of the United \r\nNations in responding to humanitarian need around the \r\nglobe. They highlight the steps that the United Nations \r\nand other relief organizations can take to better assist \r\nthose in need and to ensure that scarce resources stretch \r\nas far as possible. The draft resolutions also articulate \r\nhow Member States can better support the humanitarian \r\ncommunity’s life-saving work more effectively and \r\nreaffirm the importance of international law and the \r\nstandards meant to protect those affected by conflict \r\nand disasters.\r\nThe United States remains committed to standing \r\nby people in their time of greatest need, be they \r\nsuffering due to conflict, such as in Syria, or surviving \r\nand recovering from the impact of natural disasters. \r\nThe United States believes that women should have \r\nequal access to health care, including in humanitarian \r\nemergencies. The United States is not only the world’s \r\nsingle largest humanitarian donor but also the world’s \r\nlargest donor of bilateral assistance for reproductive \r\nhealth and voluntary family planning. We believe that \r\nin humanitarian emergencies, women’s access to health \r\ncare is life-saving and should be available from the onset \r\nof an emergency, whenever possible. We also believe \r\nthat it should not include abortion or the promotion of \r\nabortion as a method of family planning. Therefore, \r\nin order to address that concern, we have proposed an \r\namendment to operative paragraph 59 of draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.18/Rev.1, entitled “International cooperation \r\non humanitarian assistance in the field of natural \r\ndisasters, from relief to development”. Similarly, in \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.61, entitled “Strengthening of \r\nthe coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance \r\nof the United Nations”, my delegation has proposed \r\namendments to operative paragraphs 58 and 59. The \r\namendments are contained in documents A/73/L.64 \r\nand A/73/L.65, respectively.\r\nThe United States remains firmly committed to its \r\nmultifaceted role as a leader in humanitarian diplomacy \r\nand action around the world. We will continue to pursue \r\nthe improved coordination and efficient delivery of \r\nhumanitarian aid for the millions across the globe in \r\nneed of relief from conflict and other tragedies.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): Bangladesh attaches \r\ngreat importance to United Nations humanitarian and \r\nemergency relief assistance and remains supportive of \r\ninternational efforts to help build resilient societies and \r\nnations in order to respond to humanitarian challenges. \r\nIndeed, resolution 46/182 remains the cornerstone \r\nof all such efforts. Constructive engagement and \r\nthe coordinating role of national Governments \r\nare instrumental in facilitating international \r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nInternational humanitarian assistance should \r\nadhere to the overarching and fundamental principles \r\nof humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. \r\nWe underscore the need for better coherence and \r\ncoordination among Member States, United Nations \r\nagencies and other relevant stakeholders in promoting \r\nthe spirit of working together towards one humanity. \r\nThe unwarranted politicization of humanitarian issues, \r\nand thereby the creation of hindrances to delivering \r\nlife-saving assistance when it is needed the most, \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 25/29\r\nmust be avoided. Humanitarian responses should be \r\npredictable, faster, timely and more effective.\r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed continued high \r\ndemand for humanitarian relief and assistance across \r\nthe globe. There are 135 million people in need and \r\nan amount of $23.5 billion is required. Because of our \r\npolitical commitment to the global good, Bangladesh is \r\nsubstantially increasing its modest contribution to the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund.\r\nWe believe that attaining sustainable development \r\nthrough the inclusive engagement of relevant actors \r\ncould be an effective solution to many humanitarian \r\ncrises, including those related to forced displacement. \r\nThe international community needs to consider and \r\nundertake development activities with a focus on \r\nbuilding resilience and ultimately reducing dependency \r\non humanitarian aid. It is imperative to ensure better \r\ncooperation between humanitarian and development \r\nactors to enable a smooth transition from relief to \r\ndevelopment. The underlying root causes that adversely \r\nimpact the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance \r\nneed to be addressed in a holistic manner. There is a \r\nneed for discretion in apportioning financing support \r\nfor humanitarian and development work without \r\ncompromising their respective priorities.\r\nBangladesh recognizes the importance of \r\ntransition from emergency response to preparedness \r\nand resilience-building. In full respect for national \r\nconditions and actual needs on the ground, the \r\ninternational community should develop mechanisms \r\nto provide enhanced, sustainable, f lexible and \r\nmulti-year financing support and related expertise, \r\ntechnologies and products. We also acknowledge the \r\ncentrality of the role of women as first responders \r\nand the need to further strengthen gender-responsive \r\npolicy development concerning disaster-risk reduction \r\nand mitigation.\r\nThe Assembly is perhaps aware of the Rohingya \r\nhumanitarian crisis, one of the fastest growing crises \r\nof its kind. It has been thrust upon Bangladesh and \r\nmeans that we are now sheltering approximately \r\n1.1 million forcibly displaced Rohingyas who f led into \r\nour territory from Myanmar’s Rakhine state. Within \r\nour limited capacity, we are doing our utmost to \r\nprovide them with humanitarian support, but that is not \r\nenough. We acknowledge the support of international \r\nhumanitarian mechanisms, including the relevant \r\nUnited Nations agencies, in addressing the critical \r\nneeds of the Rohingyas. We also urge them to come \r\nforward to share the burden and the responsibility. \r\nUnimpeded humanitarian access to Rakhine state \r\nwould also be critical.\r\nBangladesh remains concerned about the denial \r\nof humanitarian access in many conflict situations. \r\nWe condemn the indiscriminate armed attacks against \r\nhumanitarian personnel and convoys, medical and \r\npeacekeeping personnel and civilian infrastructure \r\nessential to humanitarian operations. We urge all parties \r\nto conflicts to refrain from such attacks, blockades \r\nand impediments. We also emphasize the importance \r\nof evidence-based information to ensure probity and \r\naccountability in the event of any reported violence. \r\nWe noted with appreciation the improvements that \r\nhave been made by the United Nations humanitarian \r\nsystem to address sexual and gender-based violence in \r\nhumanitarian emergencies.\r\nAs a climate-vulnerable and disaster-prone \r\ncountry, Bangladesh continues to make substantive \r\ninvestments in disaster-risk reduction, prevention, \r\nmitigation and relief, building on lessons learned as \r\nwell as international best practices. In line with our \r\ncommitment to share our home-grown expertise and \r\ninnovations with others in a comparable situation, we \r\nhave made efforts to stand by the disaster-affected \r\npeoples of neighbouring countries in recent times.\r\nThe Government of Bangladesh has established a \r\nnational committee on international humanitarian law \r\nto ensure further dissemination and awareness-building \r\namong our people, with the support of the International \r\nCommittee of the Red Cross. At the international \r\nlevel, we remain committed to promoting advocacy for \r\naddressing the humanitarian needs of those displaced \r\nas a result of climate change, especially in cross-\r\nborder contexts. Currently, Bangladesh is Chair of the \r\nPlatform on Disaster Displacement, formerly known as \r\nthe Nansen Initiative. We look forward to enhancing \r\ncoordination and coherence among the relevant United \r\nNations entities and other stakeholders in further \r\npromoting dialogues on that emerging issue.\r\nIn conclusion, we thank all the facilitators for \r\ntheir diligent work on draft resolutions A/73/L.18/\r\nRev.1, A/73/L.51, A/73/L.53 and A/73/L.61, which my \r\ndelegation is pleased to support.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the observer \r\nof the Sovereign Order of Malta.\r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n26/29 18-43824\r\nMr. De Rojas (Sovereign Order of Malta): The \r\nSovereign Order of Malta would like to express its \r\ngratitude for the opportunity to take the f loor today. As \r\na 900-year-old humanitarian organization with projects \r\nin 120 countries that is committed to upholding human \r\ndignity and caring for the most vulnerable, we appreciate \r\nthe occasion to join in thanking and advocating for all \r\nthose who, on a daily basis and all over the globe, help \r\nthose who are wounded, sick, needy, marginalized and \r\nforgotten. Let me also congratulate the Assembly on \r\nconcluding the discussions on this year’s humanitarian \r\ndraft resolutions (A/73/L.18/Rev.1, A/73/L.51, \r\nA/73/L.53 and A/73/L.61). It is a great achievement \r\nthat, year after year, differences are increasingly being \r\nput aside in view of the suffering of so many people all \r\nover the world.\r\nThis year particularly has again shown us \r\nhow badly humanitarian assistance is needed. The \r\nGlobal Humanitarian Overview 2019 and the World \r\nHumanitarian Data and Trends 2018, recently compiled \r\nby the United Nations Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs, clearly show that humanitarian \r\ncrises have been increasing in number and duration. \r\nBetween 2005 and 2017, their number almost doubled, \r\nand they now last an average of seven years or longer. \r\nDespite global development gains, one in every 70 \r\npeople around the world is caught up in crisis and \r\nurgently needs humanitarian assistance. Next year, \r\nhumanitarian needs will remain extremely high, with \r\nup to 132 million people in 42 countries around the \r\nworld in need of assistance and protection, as has \r\nindeed been said by many speakers before me. In view \r\nof those alarming rising numbers, we should not relent \r\nin our efforts to foster dependable cooperation, long-\r\nterm commitment and credible accountability in the \r\nprovision of international humanitarian assistance.\r\nIt cannot be repeated enough: violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law must cease. This \r\nyear alone, 700 health-care workers were attacked \r\nand 230 health facilities destroyed or damaged. \r\nThe ability of entities such as the Order of Malta to \r\neffectively provide neutral, impartial and non-political \r\nhumanitarian assistance fundamentally depends on the \r\nsafety and security of our personnel and of those who \r\nseek their help. Deliberate attacks on hospitals, schools \r\nand humanitarian supply chains and similar crimes are \r\ndeeply worrying and simply not acceptable. Equally \r\ncrucial is the need for rapid and unimpeded access to \r\npopulations in need. We were heartened to see that, in \r\nthis year’s negotiations, a significant number of States \r\ncontinued to urge for improvements on that matter.\r\nLikewise, we are pleased to see that the \r\ninternational community has begun a dialogue on how \r\ncounter-terrorism measures can sometimes adversely \r\naffect the provision of humanitarian aid. We urge \r\nall to ensure that those policies do not bring about \r\nundesired negative effects, for example by unduly \r\nrestricting access to certain areas and groups or even \r\nby criminalizing medical and humanitarian activities \r\nand staff.\r\nAll of us here at the United Nations have the \r\nimmense privilege to lead our daily lives in relative \r\npeace and security, even though we should be united \r\nin the humbling recognition that not much separates us \r\nfrom the more than 130 million people already in need of \r\nhumanitarian assistance. At any given moment, armed \r\nconflict, natural disasters or climate change could make \r\nus one of them. Let us therefore not tire in our efforts \r\nto improve the legal frameworks, political climate and \r\nimplementation of international humanitarian law in a \r\nspirit of true international cooperation and solidarity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the observer \r\nof the International Committee of the Red Cross.\r\nMr. Mardini (International Committee of the Red \r\nCross): States have a strong track record of working \r\ntogether in the spirit of humanitarian multilateralism. \r\nThis month, States gathered in Russia to mark the 150th \r\nanniversary of the Declaration of St. Petersburg to the \r\neffect of prohibiting the use of certain projectiles in \r\nwartime. Next year, we mark the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the Geneva Conventions of 1949.\r\nThe humanitarian rules of the four Conventions \r\nof 1949 were negotiated on the basis of people’s \r\nexperience of armed conflict as combatants, civilians \r\nand persons hors de combat. Millions of people \r\nenduring armed conflict today need that tradition of \r\nhumanitarian multilateralism to continue. Today we \r\ndraw attention to three priority humanitarian needs \r\nthat States must fulfil.\r\nFirst, all States must ensure the physical security \r\nand safety of civilians. That is especially important \r\nfor any State supporting other States or non-State \r\narmed groups in coalition warfare. States that supply \r\nbelligerents with weapons have a special responsibility \r\nto ensure respect for international humanitarian law. \r\nThe position of such States must be strong: they must \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 27/29\r\nnot transfer arms when serious violations are manifestly \r\noccurring or where there is a substantial risk that they \r\nwill be committed.\r\nSecondly, States must prevent people from \r\ngoing missing, clarify their fate and provide answers \r\nto families. Today we are seeing a global crisis of \r\nmissing people. The International Committee of \r\nthe Red Cross (ICRC) is dealing with an enormous \r\ncaseload of missing persons, some 100,000 people, and \r\nthat is only the tip of the iceberg. We call on States to \r\nfulfil their obligations with regard to preventing people \r\nfrom going missing in armed conflict, including in \r\nplaces of detention. We call on States to take advantage \r\nof the opportunity offered by the ICRC missing \r\npersons project to tackle that challenge collectively \r\nand decisively.\r\nThirdly, States must recognize that armed conflict \r\ndamages mental as well as physical health. In that \r\nregard, we seek a multilateral surge. Several States are \r\nalready championing a greater humanitarian response. \r\nWe ask all States to contribute their expertise and \r\nresources to tackle the global challenge.\r\nEach of those three priority issues has a \r\nmulti-generational dimension. The conduct of hostilities \r\nthat ignores international humanitarian law destroys \r\nsocieties and deprives people of homes, livelihoods, \r\nhealth and education for generations. Failing to seek \r\nout missing persons or to address mental ill-health \r\nresulting from conflict can exacerbate social and \r\npolitical tensions.\r\nFinally, in order for impartial humanitarian \r\norganizations such as the ICRC to work with States \r\nto address those and other pressing humanitarian \r\nneeds, we need the trust and cooperation of States \r\nin order to work freely and effectively. Political and \r\nsecurity responses to new global threats are having a \r\nserious effect on the ability of impartial humanitarian \r\norganizations to consistently provide principled \r\nhumanitarian action.\r\nThe ICRC urges all States to address the \r\npressing challenge to neutral, impartial and \r\nindependent humanitarian action posed by counter-\r\nterrorism measures and sanctions regimes. Impartial \r\nhumanitarian organizations cannot reach out to \r\npeople in a timely and effective way if humanitarian \r\naction is at risk of criminalization or is hindered by \r\ncomplex sanctions procedures and counter-terrorism \r\nmeasures. The ICRC understands and respects the \r\nsovereign right of States to safeguard their legitimate \r\nsecurity concerns, including through counter-terrorism \r\nmeasures. However, such measures, must be, and \r\nremain, consistent with international law, including \r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nIncreasingly, strict funding conditions and rigid \r\ncounter-terrorism legislation run counter to the \r\ncommitments that States have made to respecting \r\nlong-established humanitarian principles. That, in \r\nturn, can risk undermining the trust of affected \r\npeople and of parties to conflict and can render the \r\nprovision of principled humanitarian action more \r\nprecarious. We call on States to ensure that national \r\nlegislation and international regimes on counter-\r\nterrorism and sanctions include exemption clauses for \r\nthe humanitarian activities of impartial humanitarian \r\norganizations. The ICRC stands ready to offer its \r\nhumanitarian and legal expertise in the development \r\nof new rules and regulations pertaining to counter-\r\nterrorism issues.\r\nThe challenge of preventing, responding to and \r\nrecovering from conflict is immense, but we already \r\nhave many of the laws, organizations and operational \r\ntools at our disposal to achieve a sustainable \r\nhumanitarian impact for millions of people. States \r\nhave an impressive record of humanitarian cooperation \r\nin law, policy and practice. The choice to respect the \r\nlaw, reduce suffering and preserve human dignity is a \r\npolitical one that rests with Member States. We call on \r\nall States to recommit to humanitarian multilateralism \r\nat this critical juncture.\r\nThe ICRC and the International Red Cross and \r\nRed Crescent Movement stand ready to play its part. \r\nWe look forward to meeting with States on these and \r\nother important humanitarian priorities at the thirty-\r\nthird International Conference of the Red Cross and \r\nRed Crescent in Geneva next year.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the observer \r\nof the International Federation of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies.\r\nMs. Ghukasyan (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): On behalf of the \r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nSocieties (IFRC) and its 191 national societies, allow \r\nme to express our gratitude for the opportunity to \r\nspeak during this important debate.\r\nA/73/PV.53 14/12/2018\r\n28/29 18-43824\r\nIn 2015, the world pledged to leave no one \r\nbehind as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, but humanitarian needs are growing at \r\nan extraordinary speed and are outpacing the resources \r\nthat we have available to respond to them. That makes \r\nit increasingly difficult for humanitarian organizations \r\nto meet the commitments of the 2030 Agenda. Despite \r\nall our efforts, millions of people are still left behind in \r\nhumanitarian response.\r\nThis year we issued our f lagship report, the World \r\nDisasters Report 2018, under the theme “Leaving no one \r\nbehind in humanitarian response”. The report describes \r\nhow, out of the 134 million people who required \r\nhumanitarian assistance in 2018, the international \r\ncommunity reached approximately 90 million people, \r\nleaving a gap of 29 per cent. The report explores how \r\nvarious people are left behind in humanitarian response \r\nand highlights particular groups that are not receiving \r\nthe assistance that they need. It calls for better attention \r\nin order to ensure that the people in greatest need \r\nreceive assistance, including improved assistance to \r\npersons with disabilities, the elderly, people who live \r\nin remote areas and are difficult to reach due to the \r\nlimited humanitarian presence and access, those who \r\ndo not have identity documents, survivors of sexual and \r\ngender-based violence, irregular migrants and victims \r\nof urban violence.\r\nThe report also identifies five fatal f laws that allow \r\nso many people to be overlooked. Too many affected \r\npeople are out of sight, out of reach, left out of the loop, \r\nfind themselves in crises where there is no more money \r\nor are deemed to be out of scope because they are \r\nsuffering in ways that are not seen as the responsibility \r\nof the humanitarian sector. That calls for a change in \r\ntraditional approaches to humanitarian assistance in \r\norder to minimize the risk of vulnerable people being \r\nleft behind by giving a number of recommendations. \r\nAllow me to focus on three such recommendations that \r\nare relevant to today’s debate.\r\nFirst, the international humanitarian community \r\nshould do more to recognize and support local \r\nhumanitarian action. The importance of more \r\nlocalized aid through empowered local action has \r\nbeen considerably boosted on the international policy \r\nagenda since the World Humanitarian Summit in \r\n2016. However, our intention of and commitment to \r\nsupporting local actors that have been previously \r\nexpressed have not yet become a reality. That clearly \r\ndemonstrates the need to reconsider our working \r\nmodel, which fails to recognize and embrace locally \r\nled response and action. For the localization agenda \r\nto become a reality, international humanitarian actors \r\nneed to support and complement existing national \r\ncoordination mechanisms and increase efforts to engage \r\nlocal actors in international coordination mechanisms. \r\nThe importance of promoting a f lexible humanitarian \r\necosystem that is inclusive of a broad range of actors \r\nand strengths must be acknowledged.\r\nSecondly, increased investment and action are \r\nneeded in climate-smart laws and policies, targeting \r\nthe most vulnerable and marginalized. Climate change \r\nis not a new concern. Humanitarian actors, including \r\nthe IFRC, have been dealing with the increasing risks \r\nfor years, addressing them largely through their work to \r\nsupport people before, during and after crises. However, \r\nthe rising risk of climate change, which has been \r\nreinforced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \r\nChange’s newly released special report on Global \r\nWarming of 1.5°C, requires a scale-up of adaptation \r\nactions and greater cooperation among humanitarian \r\nand development actors, as well as with climate \r\nscientists, donors and other relevant actors. There is \r\na need for ongoing ref lection on the implications of \r\nclimate science for those that are most affected and \r\nvulnerable to the consequences of climate change.\r\nThere is also a need to address the financing of \r\nhumanitarian action, in particular for scaling up early \r\nwarning and early action and anticipatory, forecast-\r\nbased financing. In that regard, as an active implementer \r\nand promoter of anticipatory programming since 2014, \r\nthe IFRC particularly welcomes the recognition in \r\nthis year’s draft resolution (A/73/L.61) of the need to \r\nfurther explore and scale up forecast-based financing \r\nmechanisms in humanitarian response with the overall \r\nobjective of anticipating, preventing, if possible, and \r\nreducing the suffering and destruction caused by severe \r\nweather conditions.\r\nThirdly, all humanitarian actors should adopt a \r\ncommunity-centred, participatory approach. It is hard \r\nto leave people behind if one is there in the community \r\nwith them in the first place. That is why the report \r\nmakes the case for local action to be carried out by \r\nlocal humanitarian workers who live and work among \r\nthe people whom they serve, are from the communities \r\nand are there to make the last mile their first mile.\r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.53\r\n18-43824 29/29\r\nThe key for the coming years will be to link the \r\nglobal to the local, as global problems such as climate \r\nchange add significantly to the risks that we face. \r\nThose problems continue to materialize at the local \r\nlevel, and we need to understand the local realities to \r\nfind the right solutions to reduce vulnerability. The \r\nIFRC and its 191 national societies, through their \r\npower to penetrate communities, will continue to focus \r\non leaving the communities we work for stronger and \r\nbetter able to withstand the shocks that they face.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item for this morning. \r\nAction on the draft resolution and amendments \r\nubmitted under this agenda item will be taken this \r\nafternoon in this Hall at 3 p.m.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
