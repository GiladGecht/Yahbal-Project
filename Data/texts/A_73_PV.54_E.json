"United Nations A/73/PV.54\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n54th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 14 December 2018, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Ten-Pow \r\n(Guyana), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 75\r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian \r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations, \r\nincluding special economic assistance\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/73/392 and \r\nCorr. 1 and 2)\r\n(a) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/73/78, \r\nA/73/170 and A/73/343)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/73/L.18/Rev.1, A/73/L.51, \r\nA/73/L.53 and A/73/L.61)\r\nDraft amendments (A/73/L.64 and A/73/L.65)\r\n(b) Assistance to the Palestinian people\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/73/84 and \r\nCorr. 1)\r\n(c) Special economic assistance to individual \r\ncountries or regions\r\nThe Acting President: We shall now proceed to \r\nconsider draft resolutions A/73/L.18/Rev.1, A/73/L.51, \r\nA/73/L.53 and A/73/L.61 and draft amendments \r\nA/73/L.64 and A/73/L.65.\r\nBefore giving the f loor for explanations of \r\nvote before the vote, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Mohammed (Sudan): First and foremost, I \r\nwould like to pay tribute to all humanitarian workers \r\nand United Nations personnel around the world for their \r\nvaluable sacrifices. We extend our heartfelt condolences \r\nto the families of those killed in the line of duty around \r\nthe world.\r\nWe have serious reservations about the inclusion \r\nof references to the jurisdiction of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) in draft resolution A/73/L.51 \r\nand other draft resolutions. To include such references \r\nand language would exert unacceptable pressure on \r\nStates Members of the United Nations. We draw the \r\nAssembly’s attention to the twenty-ninth preambular \r\nparagraph and paragraph 7 of draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.51, and we request that both paragraphs be put \r\nto the vote separately.\r\nWe reject the inclusion of the ICC in draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.51 — and its inclusion in other draft \r\nresolutions — for the following reasons.\r\nFirst, the Court is not an organ of the United \r\nNations, notwithstanding several attempts by some \r\nparties to paint it otherwise in meetings of the Main \r\nCommittees of the General Assembly. We continue to \r\nadvance this solid conviction, which is supported by \r\npractice and law.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n18-44140 (E)\r\n*1844140*\r\n \r\nA/73/PV.54 14/12/2018\r\n2/11 18-44140\r\nSecondly, the Rome Statute and other international \r\ntreaties are incompatible with established norms \r\nof international law, and their articles contain \r\ncontradictions within themselves. Article 26 of the \r\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties states that \r\nevery treaty in force is binding only on the parties to \r\nit, based on the principle of free consent. The Rome \r\nStatute imposes obligations on non-party States. We \r\nwould like to refer here to the joint statement by the \r\ndelegations of India and the United States of America \r\nimmediately after the adoption of the Rome Statute on \r\n17 July 1998, which expressed the view from the very \r\nbeginning that international law, and specifically the \r\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, had fallen \r\nvictim to this Statute.\r\nThirdly, since 2003 the International Criminal Court \r\nhas been only an impediment to peace in Darfur. The \r\nICC is bound to create a serious conflict between peace \r\nand justice. It remains the main challenge facing the \r\ninternational community and the national Government \r\nof the Sudan in the area. It jeopardizes both peace and \r\nsecurity. At best, the ICC represents a threat to peace \r\nand stability in Darfur, Africa and in many other parts \r\nof the world, not to mention the problems created by its \r\ndisruptive history since its inception. The ICC has been \r\nfraught with corruption and one scandal after another.\r\nFourthly, the ICC lacks independence, as half \r\nof its budget is drawn from voluntary contributions \r\nfrom the States and non-governmental organizations \r\nthat exercise control over it. We have opposed the \r\nInternational Criminal Court since the beginning \r\nbecause of all those considerations. The ways in which \r\nwe express our opposition have of course changed \r\naccording to circumstances and our official position as \r\na sovereign Member State of this Organization.\r\nFinally, we reiterate hereby our full support for the \r\ndraft resolution as a whole. Humanitarian assistance is a \r\nvital and instrumental means to address crises, whether \r\nhuman-made or resulting from natural causes. That is \r\nwhy the lofty goals of humanitarian assistance should \r\nnot be confused with such politically driven language, \r\nwhich will lead only to discord and division. We call \r\non all Member States to vote against the inclusion of \r\nthe twenty-ninth preambular paragraph and operative \r\nparagraph 7 as they stand in draft resolution A/73/L.51.\r\nMr. Kickert (Austria): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union (EU) and its member \r\nStates. The candidate countries Turkey, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia \r\nand Albania; the country of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidate Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina; and the European Free Trade Association \r\ncountry Norway, member of the European Economic \r\nArea, align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe EU deeply regrets the decision of the United \r\nStates to present an amendment (A/73/L.65) to the draft \r\nresolution on the strengthening of the coordination \r\nof emergency humanitarian assistance of the United \r\nNations (A/73/L.61) and an amendment (A/73/L.64 ) \r\nto the draft resolution on international cooperation on \r\nhumanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, \r\nfrom relief to development (A/73/L.18/Rev.1), both \r\nof which draft resolutions have always been adopted \r\nby consensus.\r\nThe decisions to revert to previously agreed language \r\nin paragraphs 58 and 59 of draft resolution A/73/L.61 and \r\nparagraph 59 of draft resolution A/73/L.18/Rev.1 were \r\nwidely agreed to when it became clear that concerted \r\nand lengthy efforts to find alternative wording would \r\nnot lead to an acceptable agreement for all delegations. \r\nSweden and Morocco, facilitators for draft resolutions \r\nA/73/L.61 and A/73/L.18/Rev.1, respectively, made \r\nevery effort to conduct negotiations in a fair and \r\ntransparent manner. We commend the facilitators, as \r\nwell as those who participated in negotiations, for their \r\ngenuine efforts to maintain consensus and achieve a \r\ngood draft resolution for all.\r\nThe United Nations membership, many of whom \r\nhold divergent views on the issues at hand, have always \r\nbeen able to agree on this language. That illustrates \r\nhow carefully crafted and balanced these long-standing \r\nparagraphs are. In that context, let us not forget that the \r\ninternational community made a shared commitment \r\nin the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to \r\nachieve gender equality and the empowerment of all \r\nwomen and girls, which includes universal access to \r\nhealth-care services. International cooperation on \r\ncrucial humanitarian matters such as these requires us \r\nto act in a responsible way. Undermining consensus \r\non these draft resolutions can have only negative \r\nconsequences, impacting first and foremost the most \r\nfundamental rights of women and girls in need of \r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nFor the reasons I mentioned, the 28 States members \r\nof the European Union will vote against the amendments \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.54\r\n18-44140 3/11\r\nproposed by the United States, and we call on all other \r\nStates to also vote no.\r\nIn addition, regarding the proposal just made \r\nby the representative of the Sudan, I wish to make a \r\nstatement on behalf of the European Union and its \r\nmember States. The candidate countries the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia \r\nand Albania; the country of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidate Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina; and the European Free Trade Association \r\ncountries Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the \r\nEuropean Economic Area; as well as Ukraine, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova and Georgia, align themselves \r\nwith this statement.\r\nWe deeply regret that the Sudan has called for a \r\nvote on the twenty-ninth preambular paragraph and \r\noperative paragraph 7 of draft resolution A/73/L.51. \r\nThe references to the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) in the preambular and operative parts of the \r\nresolution on the safety and security of humanitarian \r\npersonnel and protection of United Nations personnel \r\nhave existed since the first resolution on that subject \r\nwas adopted in 1999 (resolution 54/192).\r\nThe EU and its member States reiterate their \r\nunwavering support for the ICC as the world’s first \r\npermanent international criminal court and an important \r\ntool of the international community for fighting \r\nimpunity and contributing to peaceful societies. The \r\ngross violations of international humanitarian law and \r\nhuman rights that we witness worldwide are a sharp \r\nreminder of the increasing relevance of the Court, the \r\nrole of which is to complement rather than replace \r\nexisting national jurisdictions.\r\nThe primary responsibility to investigate and \r\nprosecute crimes remains with individual States. All \r\nperpetrators of such crimes must be held accountable \r\nfor their actions. A key element in the Rome Statute is \r\nits equal application. In that respect, the creation of the \r\nICC has given millions of victims of atrocity crimes \r\nnew hope that justice will be done. States from all over \r\nthe world have joined efforts to make that possible.\r\nThe EU and its member States consider that the \r\nfight against impunity for the most serious crimes is \r\ncritical to ensure a fair and just society by holding \r\nthe perpetrators accountable and ensuring justice \r\nfor victims. We also consider that peace and justice \r\nare complementary and not mutually exclusive. For \r\nthose reasons, the 28 member States of the European \r\nUnion will vote in favour of retaining the twenty-ninth \r\npreambular paragraph and operative paragraph 7 of \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.51. We call on all other States, \r\nin particular States parties to the Rome Statute of the \r\nICC, to do the same, voting yes to the retention of \r\nthose paragraphs.\r\nMr. Sohlström (Sweden): We fully align \r\nourselves with the statement just made on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union.\r\nAs the facilitator and main co-sponsor of this \r\nyear’s omnibus draft resolution on the strengthening of \r\nthe coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance \r\nof the United Nations (A/73/L.61), I would like to make \r\nsome comments in my national capacity. \r\nI wish to note that an omnibus resolution on \r\nhumanitarian assistance has been adopted by consensus \r\nfor 27 years. It is a resolution on the humanitarian \r\nsystem that has strong regional support and a strong \r\nhistory of consensus. As the main co-sponsor of this \r\ndraft resolution and as facilitator, we call upon the \r\nsponsors of the draft resolutions — not all Member \r\nStates — to defend the text and to vote against the \r\namendments proposed to it.\r\nMs. Pritchard (Canada): I will deliver this \r\nstatement in two parts. I have the honour to deliver \r\nthe first part of this statement on behalf of Argentina, \r\nAustralia, Colombia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Mexico, \r\nNew Zealand, Switzerland, Uruguay and my own \r\ncountry, Canada.\r\nWe deeply regret that the agreed language related \r\nto sexual and reproductive health and rights is being \r\nchallenged in the proposed amendments (A/73/L.64 \r\nand A/73/L.65) to the draft resolutions on international \r\ncooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of \r\nnatural disasters, from relief to development (A/73/L.18/\r\nRev.1) and on the strengthening of the coordination \r\nof emergency humanitarian assistance of the United \r\nNations (A/73/L.61).\r\nReliable and safe access to sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth services is essential to ensuring the health and \r\nwell-being of all people, especially women and girls. \r\nIn humanitarian crises, the need for such services is \r\nparticularly acute, owing to the heightened risk of \r\ndisease, potential complications for maternal, newborn \r\nand child health as a result of displacement and service \r\ndisruption, and the frequent occurrence of sexual and \r\ngender-based violence, particularly in conflict settings. \r\nA/73/PV.54 14/12/2018\r\n4/11 18-44140\r\nIt is estimated that a staggering 60 per cent of maternal \r\nmortality occurs in humanitarian and fragile settings \r\nbecause women do not have access to the services they \r\nneed. That is more than 500 women and girls dying \r\nevery single day because they lack access to services.\r\nTimely and effective sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth interventions can help to prevent morbidity and \r\nmortality, including for women and girls, who may be \r\nespecially vulnerable. The language in draft resolutions \r\nA/73/L.18/Rev.1 and A/73/L.61 reflects years of \r\nconsensus and recognizes the important role that sexual \r\nand reproductive health services can play in advancing \r\ngender equality and in providing long-term support for \r\nachieving women’s and girl’s economic empowerment, \r\npoverty reduction and sustainable development.\r\nIn addition, ensuring access to quality sexual \r\nand reproductive health services in humanitarian \r\nsettings requires precisely the kind of coordination \r\nand cooperation that this draft resolution seeks to \r\npromote. We are therefore deeply disappointed that this \r\nlanguage is being challenged at this time, and we call \r\nupon all delegations to vote against draft amendments \r\nA/73/L.64 and A/73/L.65.\r\nI have the honour to deliver the second part of this \r\nstatement on behalf of Australia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, \r\nNew Zealand, Switzerland and my own country, \r\nCanada.\r\nWe regret than a vote has been called on the twenty-\r\nninth preambular paragraph and operative paragraph \r\n7 of draft resolution A/73/L.51, which the Sudan has \r\njust introduced.\r\nThe twenty-ninth preambular paragraph of the draft \r\nresolution recalls that attacks intentionally directed \r\nagainst civilian personnel involved in a humanitarian \r\nassistance or peacekeeping mission, in accordance \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations, are war crimes \r\nunder the Rome Statute of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC), and notes the role that the Court can play \r\nin bringing to justice those responsible. That paragraph \r\nhas been agreed language for years now.\r\nOperative paragraph 7 of the draft resolution calls \r\nupon all States to consider becoming parties to the \r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court. That \r\nhas also been agreed language for many years. Nothing \r\nin paragraph 7 requires States to become signatories to \r\nthe Rome Statute. Nothing in that paragraph seeks to \r\nimpose the jurisdiction of the Court on States that are \r\nnot parties to the Rome Statute. What that paragraph \r\ndoes is recall one of the tools available to all Member \r\nStates to protect humanitarian and United Nations \r\npersonnel and encourage them to avail themselves of it.\r\nThe ICC has a key role to play in ending impunity \r\nwhere national courts are unwilling or unable to \r\nexercise jurisdiction, including in situations where \r\nhumanitarian workers and peacekeeping personnel \r\nare the targets of violent attacks. As stated in the \r\nRome Statute, the objective of such investigations and \r\nprosecutions is to end impunity for the perpetrators of \r\nsuch crimes, and thus to contribute to the prevention of \r\nsuch crimes. Ending attacks on humanitarian workers \r\nand peacekeepers goes to the heart and purpose of the \r\ndraft resolution.\r\nWe therefore find it deeply disturbing that this \r\nestablished consensus is now being attacked for reasons \r\nthat have nothing to do with the topic dealt with in the \r\ndraft resolution and are to the detriment of our common \r\ncause. We call upon all delegations to vote in support of \r\nthose paragraphs as drafted, and we will do the same.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take decisions on draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.18/Rev.1, entitled “International \r\ncooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of \r\nnatural disasters, from relief to development”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the submission of the draft resolution, in \r\naddition to those delegations listed in the document, \r\nthe following countries have become sponsors of \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.18/Rev.1: Albania, Andorra, \r\nArmenia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, \r\nCanada, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, \r\nEstonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, \r\nIreland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kiribati, \r\nLatvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMali, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, \r\nNigeria, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, \r\nRomania, the Russian Federation, San Marino, Sao \r\nTome and Principe, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, \r\nSweden, Switzerland, the former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine and the \r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.54\r\n18-44140 5/11\r\nThe Acting President: In connection with the \r\ndraft resolution, the General Assembly has before it a \r\ndraft amendment circulated in document A/73/L.64. \r\nIn accordance with rule 90 of the rules of procedure, \r\nthe Assembly will first take a decision on the \r\ndraft amendment. A recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nBelarus, Côte d’Ivoire, Guatemala, Sudan, Togo, \r\nUnited States of America\r\nAgainst:\r\nAlbania, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, \r\nAustralia, Austria, Belgium, Bhutan, Bolivia \r\n(Plurinational State of), Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nBrazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Cambodia, \r\nCanada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, \r\nCroatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, \r\nDjibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El \r\nSalvador, Eritrea, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, \r\nGeorgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, \r\nIndia, Indonesia, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, \r\nJapan, Kenya, Kiribati, Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic, Latvia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, \r\nLuxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, \r\nMarshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, \r\nMongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, \r\nNamibia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, \r\nNigeria, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, \r\nPeru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Republic of \r\nKorea, Romania, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint \r\nLucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, \r\nSan Marino, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, \r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri \r\nLanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Tunisia, \r\nTurkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, Uruguay, Vanuatu, \r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, \r\nZambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAbstaining:\r\nAfghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, \r\nEthiopia, Ghana, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, \r\nKuwait, Lebanon, Malawi, Myanmar, Oman, \r\nPanama, Qatar, Russian Federation, Sao Tome \r\nand Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, United Arab \r\nEmirates, Yemen\r\nDraft amendment A/73/L.64 was rejected by 6 votes \r\nto 110, with 22 abstentions.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the United States on a point of order.\r\nMs. Nemroff (United States of America): The \r\namendments that we sought were very important to the \r\ndelegation of the United States.

\r\n(resolution 73/139).\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor to \r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in explanation of \r\nvote or position on the resolutions just adopted, may \r\nI remind delegations that explanations are limited to \r\n10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMs. Nemroff (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is pleased to join the consensus on these \r\nresolutions and reaffirms the vital function of the \r\nUnited Nations in responding to humanitarian need \r\naround the globe. The United States has long been a \r\nworld leader in providing humanitarian assistance to \r\npeople in need, including through the United Nations, \r\nand we remain committed to supporting those in need.\r\nIn the light of the scale of need and the Organization’s \r\nrole in the delivery of humanitarian assistance \r\nglobally, resolution 73/139, on strengthening of the \r\ncoordination of emergency humanitarian assistance \r\nof the United Nations, should contribute to improving \r\nthe international humanitarian system. In that regard, \r\nwe welcome the progress achieved by Member States \r\ntogether throughout recent negotiations.\r\nAlthough we welcome the adoption of resolution \r\n73/137, on the safety and security of humanitarian \r\npersonnel and protection of United Nations personnel, \r\nwe would like to take this opportunity to make an \r\nimportant point of clarification. The resolution includes \r\nreferences to the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nand the Rome Statute that the United States cannot \r\nsupport. As it stands, the language in the resolution \r\ndoes not sufficiently distinguish between parties and \r\nnon-parties to the Rome Statute, and is otherwise \r\ncontrary to the United States position on the ICC, as \r\nannounced by the White House on 10 September.\r\nIn particular, the United States reiterates its \r\ncontinuing and long-standing principled objection \r\nto any assertion of ICC jurisdiction over nationals of \r\nStates that are not party to the Rome Statute, including \r\nthe United States and Israel, absent a referral from the \r\nSecurity Council or the consent of the State in question.\r\nWe also wish to reiterate our serious and \r\nfundamental concerns with the ICC Prosecutor’s \r\nproposed investigation of United States personnel in \r\nthe context of the conflict in Afghanistan. The United \r\nStates remains a leader in the fight to end impunity \r\nand continues to support justice and accountability \r\nfor international crimes, including war crimes, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and genocide. We respect the decision \r\nof those nations that have chosen to join the ICC. In \r\nturn, we expect that our decision not to join and not to \r\nplace our citizens under the ICC’s jurisdiction will also \r\nbe respected.\r\nIn addition to the statement just provided, the United \r\nStates would like to issue the following explanation of \r\nposition on resolutions 73/139, on strengthening of the \r\ncoordination of emergency humanitarian assistance \r\nof the United Nations, and 73/136, on international \r\ncooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of \r\nnatural disasters, from relief to development, for which \r\nwe are also pleased to join the consensus.\r\nWhile we welcome the adoption of those resolutions, \r\nwe would like to make a number of important points of \r\nclarification on some of their elements. We underscore \r\nthat General Assembly resolutions and many of the \r\noutcome documents they reference are non-binding \r\ndocuments that do not create rights or obligations \r\nunder international law, nor do they bind States to any \r\nfinancial commitments.\r\nWith regard to the references to the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development contained in those \r\nresolutions, the United States wishes to refer to its \r\nstatement at the 44th plenary meeting of the General \r\nAssembly, on 3 December, under agenda item 12 \r\n(see A/73/PV.44). The United States notes that its \r\nAdministration has announced its intention to withdraw \r\nfrom the Paris Agreement on Climate Change as soon \r\nas it is eligible to do so, consistent with the terms of the \r\nAgreement, unless suitable terms for re-engagement \r\nare identified. Therefore, the Paris Agreement and \r\nA/73/PV.54 14/12/2018\r\n10/11 18-44140\r\nclimate change language in these resolutions is without \r\nprejudice to United States positions. We affirm our \r\nsupport for promoting economic growth and improving \r\nenergy security while protecting the environment.\r\nWe also reiterate our views on the Sendai \r\nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction, as set forth in \r\nthe United States explanation of position delivered on \r\n18 March 2015.\r\nThe United States cannot support language that \r\nundermines incentives for innovation, such as calls for \r\ntechnology transfer that are not voluntary or on mutually \r\nagreed terms. It underlines that such language will have \r\nno standing in future negotiations. With respect to the \r\nNew Urban Agenda, the United States reiterates our \r\nviews, as set forth in the United States explanation of \r\nposition delivered on 20 October 2016.\r\nFurthermore, the United States believes that each \r\nMember States has the sovereign right to determine \r\nhow it conducts trade with other countries, which \r\nincludes restricting trade in certain circumstances. \r\nWe are within our rights to utilize our trade and \r\ncommercial policy as tools to achieve noble objectives. \r\nWithin the omnibus resolution on the strengthening of \r\nthe coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance \r\nof the United Nations, the United States is strongly \r\nsupportive of the message of paragraph 67 regarding \r\nthe need for accountability. We read the paragraph’s \r\nlanguage on the need to bring those responsible for \r\nviolations of international law to justice to refer only to \r\nthose actions that constitute criminal violations under \r\napplicable international law.\r\nWe emphasize that, in the twenty-eighth preambular \r\nparagraph and paragraph 65 of the same resolution, the \r\nreference to\r\n“the applicable rules of international humanitarian \r\nlaw relating to the non-punishment of any person \r\nfor carrying out medical activities compatible with \r\nmedical ethics”\r\nis not meant to prejudge when and how such rules are \r\napplicable to any particular situation.\r\nThe United States also supports international \r\ncooperation on immigration issues, but it is the \r\nprimary responsibility of sovereign States to ensure \r\nthat immigration is managed consistent with their law \r\nand policy. The United States cannot support processes \r\nor documents that may result in the infringement of \r\nour sovereign rights. The New York Declaration for \r\nRefugees and Migrants, of 19 September 2016, which \r\nwas negotiated by a prior United States Administration, \r\ncommits the States Members of the United Nations to \r\n“strengthening global governance” of international \r\nmigration. The Declaration contains policy goals that \r\nare inconsistent with United States law and policy, \r\nand the United States cannot support reaffirming \r\nthat Declaration. It therefore dissociates itself from \r\nthe twenty-third preambular paragraph of resolution \r\n73/109.\r\nLastly, the United States believes that women \r\nshould have equal access to health care, including in \r\nhumanitarian emergencies. We remain committed to \r\nthe principles laid out in the Beijing Declaration and \r\nPlatform for Action and the Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment, and their reports, as agreed upon by \r\nthe General Assembly. As has been made clear over \r\nmany years, there was international consensus that the \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action do not create \r\nnew international rights, including any so-called \r\nright to abortion. The United States fully supports the \r\nprinciple of voluntary choice regarding maternal and \r\nchild health and family planning. We do not recognize \r\nabortion as a method of family planning, nor do we \r\nsupport abortion in our global health assistance.\r\nMs. Elgarf (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): My country’s \r\ndelegation would like to explain its vote on resolution \r\n73/137, which was just adopted. We wish to note the \r\nextreme importance that my delegation attaches to the \r\nissue of humanitarian assistance and its commitment to \r\nbeing constructively engaged in all intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on General Assembly resolutions aimed \r\nat strengthening United Nations efforts to improve \r\nthe response to humanitarian needs. My delegation \r\ntherefore calls on all Member States to intensify their \r\nefforts and explore all avenues to removing obstacles \r\nthat impede consensus on General Assembly resolutions \r\non humanitarian assistance, especially with regard to \r\nthis important resolution.\r\nMs. Fisher-Tsin (Israel): The Secretariat announced \r\nadditional co-sponsors of the resolution on the safety \r\nand security of humanitarian personnel and protection \r\nof the United Nations personnel (resolution 73/137). \r\nAmong them was the observer State of Palestine.\r\nAccording to paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution \r\n52/250, of 13 July 1998, entitled “Participation of \r\nPalestine in the work of the United Nations”, which \r\n14/12/2018 A/73/PV.54\r\n18-44140 11/11\r\noutlines the limited rights and privileges granted to the \r\nobserver State of Palestine, it has the right to sponsor \r\ndraft resolutions and decisions on Palestine and Middle \r\nEast issues only. The subject matter of resolution 73/137 \r\nclearly does not fall within those parameters.\r\nWe would like to stress the importance we attach \r\nto following the rules of procedure of the Organization. \r\nThe rules of sponsorship have been clearly laid out in \r\nthe rules and regulations governing the Organization. \r\nAny decision to avoid them is in violation of United \r\nNations resolutions and serves only to undermine \r\nthis institution.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 75 and its \r\nsub-items (a) to (c).\r\nAgenda item 117 (continued)\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs \r\nand other appointments\r\n(e) Appointment of members of the Committee on \r\nConferences\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/73/107)\r\nThe Acting President: Members will recall that, \r\nat its 51st plenary meeting, on 12 December 2018, the \r\nAssembly took note of the appointments of Ecuador, \r\nGermany, Ghana, Guyana, Senegal and Ukraine as \r\nmembers of the Committee on Conferences for a period \r\nof three years, beginning on 1 January 2019.\r\nMembers will also recall that one seat from among \r\nthe Asia-Pacific States for a period of three years \r\nbeginning on 1 January 2019 still remains vacant.\r\nAfter consultations with the Chair of the Group \r\nof Asia-Pacific States, the President of the General \r\nAssembly has appointed the Islamic Republic of Iran as \r\na member of the Committee on Conferences for a term \r\nof office beginning on 1 January 2019 and ending on \r\n31 December 2021.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of \r\nthis appointment?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (e) of agenda item 117?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.10 p.m.\r\n"
