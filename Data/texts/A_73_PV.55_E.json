Finally, I am grateful to all Third \r\nCommittee experts for their support to the Bureau and \r\nfor their friendship.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to respectfully commend \r\nthe reports of the Third Committee before the plenary \r\nof the General Assembly for its consideration.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the \r\nRapporteur of the Third Committee.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the \r\nrecommendations of the Committee have been made \r\nclear in the Committee and are reflected in the relevant \r\nofficial records. Therefore, if there is no proposal \r\nunder rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it \r\nthat the General Assembly decides not to discuss the \r\nreports of the Third Committee that are before the \r\nAssembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Statements will \r\ntherefore be limited to explanations of vote or position. \r\nI would like to remind members that, in accordance \r\nwith General Assembly decision 34/401, a delegation \r\nshould, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, \r\nthat is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, \r\nunless that delegation’s vote in plenary meeting is \r\ndifferent from its vote in the Committee. I would also \r\nlike to remind members that explanations are limited \r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 3/35\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Third \r\nCommittee, I would like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to proceed to take decisions in the same \r\nmanner as was done in the Committee, unless the \r\nSecretariat is notified otherwise in advance. That means \r\nthat, where separate or recorded votes were taken, we \r\nwill do the same. I would also hope that we may proceed \r\nto adopt without a vote those recommendations that \r\nwere adopted without a vote in the Third Committee. \r\nThe results of the votes will be uploaded and available \r\non the PaperSmart portal.\r\nBefore proceeding further, I would like to draw the \r\nattention of members to a note by the Secretariat, in \r\nEnglish only, entitled “List of proposals contained in \r\nthe reports of the Third Committee”, which has been \r\ncirculated as document A/C.3/73/INF/1. The note has \r\nbeen distributed desk-to-desk in the General Assembly \r\nHall as a reference guide for action on draft resolutions \r\nand decisions recommended by the Third Committee \r\nin its reports.\r\nMembers will find in column 4 of the note the \r\nsymbols of the draft resolutions and decisions of the \r\nThird Committee, with the corresponding symbols \r\nof the reports for action in the plenary in column \r\n2 of the same note. For reports containing multiple \r\nrecommendations, the draft resolution or decision \r\nnumber is contained in column 3 of the note.\r\nMembers are reminded that additional sponsors \r\nare no longer accepted now that draft resolutions and \r\ndecisions have been adopted in the Committee. Any \r\nclarification about sponsorship in the Committee reports \r\nshould be addressed to the Secretary of the Committee.\r\nFurthermore, members are reminded that any \r\ncorrections to the voting intention of delegations after \r\nthe voting has concluded on a proposal should be made \r\ndirectly to the Secretariat after the meeting. I would seek \r\nmembers’ cooperation in avoiding any interruptions to \r\nour proceedings in that regard.\r\nAgenda item 28\r\nSocial development\r\n(a) Implementation of the outcome of the World \r\nSummit for Social Development and of the \r\ntwenty-fourth special session of the General \r\nAssembly\r\n(b) Social development, including questions \r\nrelating to the world social situation and to \r\nyouth, ageing, disabled persons and the family\r\n(c) Literacy for life: shaping future agendas\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/581)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nhas before it six draft resolutions recommended by the \r\nThird Committee in paragraph 39 of its report.\r\nWe shall now take decisions on draft resolutions I to \r\nVI, one by one. After all the decisions have been taken, \r\nrepresentatives will have an opportunity to explain their \r\nvote or position on any or all of the draft resolutions.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution I, entitled \r\n“Volunteering for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment”. The Committee adopted it without \r\na vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes to \r\ndo likewise?\r\nDraft resolution I was adopted (resolution 73/140).\r\nThe President: Draft resolution II is entitled \r\n“Implementation of the outcome of the World Summit \r\nfor Social Development and of the twenty-fourth special \r\nsession of the General Assembly”.

The \r\nCommittee adopted it without a vote.

May I take it \r\nthat the Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nDraft resolution VI was adopted (resolution 73/145).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): May I take it \r\nthat it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude \r\nits consideration of agenda item 28 and its sub-items \r\n(a), (b) and (c)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 29\r\nAdvancement of women\r\n(a) Advancement of women\r\n(b) Implementation of the outcome of the Fourth \r\nWorld Conference on Women and of the twenty-\r\nthird special session of the General Assembly\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/582)\r\nDraft amendment (A/73.L.56)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nhas before it four draft resolutions recommended by the \r\nThird Committee in paragraph 37 of its report, as well \r\nas one draft decision recommended in paragraph 38 of \r\nthe same report. In connection with draft resolution I, \r\nthe General Assembly has before it a draft amendment \r\ncirculated in document A/73/L.56.\r\nI shall first give the f loor to representatives who \r\nwish to speak in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan): I would like to commend \r\nyour work, Madam President, during this session, and \r\nthe tireless efforts of the Chair of the Third Committee \r\nand his Bureau in pursuit of multilateralism and in \r\nbringing differing opinions in the Third Committee \r\nto the degree of consensus that multilateralism allows \r\nand to the degree that we can adhere to that principle, \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 5/35\r\nthe embodiment of world peace. In that context, we \r\nhave tried our best to do away with paragraphs and \r\nconcepts that might affect or compromise our general \r\nquest for the greatest possible level of consensus and \r\nfor enhancing multilateralism. Taking that principled \r\nposition into account, we would like to make the \r\nfollowing statement. I will now speak with regard to \r\nthe draft amendment we are requesting.\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nThrough draft amendment A/73/L.56, my delegation \r\nrequests the deletion of the sixteenth preambular \r\nparagraph of draft resolution I, entitled “Trafficking in \r\nwomen and girls”, recommended in the report of the \r\nThird Committee (A/73/582). The paragraph mentions \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC), and we request \r\nthe draft amendment for the following reasons.\r\nFirst, we asked for the paragraph to be rejected \r\nduring the informal consultations on the draft resolution \r\nbecause it gives the untrue impression that the ICC is \r\nthe only authority that has the jurisdiction to try certain \r\ncrimes. Furthermore, it ignores the fact that not all \r\ncountries are party to the Rome Statute, under which \r\nthe ICC was established, and that the ICC is a stand-\r\nalone organ that has nothing to do with the United \r\nNations except through their Relationship Agreement.\r\nSecondly, my delegation believes that a draft \r\nresolution containing a paragraph that references the \r\nICC in isolation from other international mechanisms \r\nignores the fact that there are many national, regional \r\nand international mechanisms that are achieving \r\nconsiderable success with regard to the issues \r\nunder consideration. That is why we proposed some \r\namendments to the paragraph during the informal \r\nconsultations with a view to striking a balance, and \r\nsuggested alternative language and options with a \r\nview to ultimately achieving consensus on the draft \r\nresolution. In fact, we spared no effort in that regard. \r\nUnfortunately, however, those efforts were fruitless and \r\nour position fell on deaf ears. Despite the fact that the \r\ntopic of the draft resolution is a very important one, the \r\nselective methods used really left us with no choice but \r\nto propose an amendment, because it is unacceptable to \r\nimpose a specific legal system as a main reference and \r\nbenchmark for all.\r\nMy delegation would also like to stress that fighting \r\nimpunity has been and remains a priority for the Sudan, \r\nwithin the framework of the principle of respect for \r\ninternational law, which ensures justice and equality \r\namong countries and preserves national sovereignty. \r\nIn that regard, my country is concerned about attempts \r\nto globalize the ICC and the Rome Statute as a legal \r\nsystem and benchmark that must be imposed on all \r\nMember States, despite the sovereign right of States to \r\nvoluntarily accede or not accede to a given agreement.\r\nThirdly, we have an established and clear position \r\non the reference to the ICC, since it helps to politicize \r\nthe language of Third Committee draft resolutions \r\nand undermines the Committee’s objectives and \r\nfundamental principles. Such references can also \r\nbe used as a platform to promote the ICC while \r\nundermining the consensus, or the unanimity, on those \r\ndraft resolutions in every instance.\r\nI would like to thank those who will vote in \r\nfavour of our amendment. We request the deletion of \r\nthe sixteenth preambular paragraph and urge Member \r\nStates to support our position and vote in favour of the \r\nproposed amendment.\r\nMr. Sparber (Liechtenstein): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of Australia, Canada, \r\nIceland, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and my \r\nown country, Liechtenstein. \r\nWe are once again deeply disturbed by one \r\ndelegation’s attempts to challenge references to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) in draft resolutions \r\nof the Third Committee that have been agreed language \r\nfor many years.\r\nThe ICC is an independent organization with a \r\nstrong institutional connection to the United Nations. \r\nIt is the world’s first and only permanent international \r\nindependent court with criminal law jurisdiction, and it \r\nhas a key role to play in ending impunity where national \r\ncourts are unwilling or unable to exercise jurisdiction \r\nover the most serious crimes under international law \r\nand in the protection of human rights. The ICC’s work \r\nis therefore vitally important within the scope of \r\nvarious Third Committee draft resolutions that will be \r\nadopted by the General Assembly today, including on \r\ntrafficking in women and girls, the rights of the child, \r\nextrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions, and the \r\nsituation of human rights in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea.\r\nWe regret that once again we are confronted \r\nwith draft amendments that undermine the important \r\nrole of the ICC in ending impunity for grave human \r\nrights violations, and thereby upholding human rights, \r\nA/73/PV.55 17/12/2018\r\n6/35 18-44315\r\nwhich is one of the Assembly’s core mandates, and \r\nthat challenge language that has been included in the \r\nrelevant texts for many years. We therefore call on all \r\nStates to vote against all draft amendments that ask for \r\nthe deletion of references to the ICC.\r\nMr. Kickert (Austria): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union and its member States. \r\nIn all brevity, and so as not to duplicate the \r\ndeliberations we already held in the Third Committee, \r\nI would just like to state that we deeply regret that the \r\nSudan has once again introduced a draft amendment \r\nto draft resolution I, seeking to delete references to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. That issue has already \r\nbeen considered in the Third Committee, and the \r\noutcome was a clear rejection of the draft amendment. \r\nAs in the Third Committee, the 28 member States of the \r\nEuropean Union will vote against the draft amendment, \r\nwhich is a deletion, and we call on all other States, \r\nparticularly States parties to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, to also vote no.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We shall now \r\ntake decisions on draft resolutions I to IV and on the \r\ndraft amendment, one by one.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution I, entitled \r\n“Trafficking in women and girls”. In connection with \r\ndraft resolution I, the General Assembly has before it \r\na draft amendment circulated in document A/73/L.56. \r\nIn accordance with rule 90 of the rules of procedure, \r\nthe Assembly shall first take a decision on the draft \r\namendment. A recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nBahrain, Belarus, Burundi, Cameroon, China, \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Egypt, \r\nEritrea, Iraq, Oman, Pakistan, Russian Federation, \r\nSaudi Arabia, Seychelles, Sudan, Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, Yemen\r\nAgainst:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Andorra, Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, \r\nBolivia (Plurinational State of), Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cabo \r\nVerde, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Congo, Costa \r\nRica, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech \r\nRepublic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nDenmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El \r\nSalvador, Estonia, Eswatini, Finland, France, \r\nGambia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, \r\nGuatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, \r\nHaiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, \r\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Latvia, Lesotho, \r\nLiberia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMalawi, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Marshall Islands, \r\nMexico, Micronesia (Federated States of), \r\nMonaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Namibia, Nepal, \r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Panama, \r\nParaguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, \r\nRepublic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Senegal, \r\nSerbia, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon \r\nIslands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-\r\nLeste, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Ukraine, \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela (Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of), Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAbstaining:\r\nAlgeria, Angola, Bahamas, Bhutan, Brunei \r\nDarussalam, Cambodia, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, \r\nIsrael, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic, Lebanon, Malaysia, \r\nMauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Papua New \r\nGuinea, Qatar, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nSingapore, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Togo, Turkey, \r\nUganda, United Arab Emirates, United States of \r\nAmerica, Viet Nam\r\nThe draft amendment was rejected by 17 votes to \r\n112, with 32 abstentions.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Third \r\nCommittee adopted draft resolution I without a vote. \r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nDraft resolution I was adopted (resolution 73/146).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Draft resolution \r\nII is entitled “Intensification of efforts to end obstetric \r\nfistula”. The Third Committee adopted it without a vote. \r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to do likewise?\r\nDraft resolution II was adopted (resolution 73/147).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We turn next to \r\ndraft resolution III, entitled “Intensification of efforts \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 7/35\r\nto prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against \r\nwomen and girls: sexual harassment”, on which a \r\nseparate recorded vote has been requested on operative \r\nparagraphs 8 (d) and 11.\r\nI now call on the representative of the Netherlands \r\non a point of order.\r\nMr. Oppenheimer (Netherlands): We are a little \r\nsurprised by what is going on because we have not been \r\ninformed about a vote. There is now suddenly a vote on \r\ndraft resolution III, and we do not really know what we \r\nare voting on.\r\nIf we are voting on keeping the text as we agreed \r\nin the Third Committee, by all means let us go ahead. \r\nHowever, it is very unclear. I am looking at the screen \r\nand I am quite certain about the outcome of the voting, \r\nso I do not necessarily want to stop it, given that it \r\nlooks positive. But we are confused about what is going \r\non. Let us continue the voting, but we would like to \r\nunderstand what we are voting on.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The delegation \r\nof the United States has requested a vote on operative \r\nparagraphs 8 (d) and 11. The representative of the \r\nNetherlands is correct in saying that draft resolution III \r\nwas adopted in the Third Committee without a vote.\r\nWe will now proceed to take action on draft \r\nresolution III. The Assembly will first take a decision \r\non the proposal to delete paragraphs 8 (d) and 11.

The Third \r\nCommittee adopted it without a vote. May I take it that \r\nthe Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nDraft resolution IV was adopted (resolution 73/149).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We shall now \r\nturn to paragraph 38 of the report to take action on \r\nthe draft decision, entitled “Documents considered \r\nby the General Assembly in connection with the item \r\n‘Advancement of women’”. The Third Committee \r\nA/73/PV.55 17/12/2018\r\n8/35 18-44315\r\nadopted it without a vote. May I take it that the Assembly \r\nwishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted (decision 73/523).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): May I take it \r\nthat it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude \r\nits consideration of agenda item 29?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 65\r\nReport of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees, questions relating to refugees, \r\nreturnees and displaced persons and humanitarian \r\nquestions\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/583)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nhas before it two draft resolutions recommended by the \r\nThird Committee in paragraph 16 of its report.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish \r\nto speak in explanation of vote or position before action \r\nis taken on draft resolutions I and II.\r\nMs. Schoulgin Nyoni (Sweden): I am honoured to \r\nmake this statement today on behalf of the five Nordic \r\ncountries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and my \r\nown country, Sweden. \r\nThe work on draft resolution II, on the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\n(UNHCR), the so-called UNHCR omnibus resolution, is \r\ntraditionally facilitated by one of the Nordic countries. \r\nThis year it has been our privilege to facilitate the draft \r\nresolution in Geneva and to present it to the General \r\nAssembly in New York.\r\nThe subject matter of the draft resolution is the \r\nmandate and work of the United Nations refugee \r\nagency, UNHCR. It is a humanitarian, non-political \r\ntext, dealing with the common ground that will enable \r\nUNHCR to continue to work in the interests of us all \r\nand, most essentially, for the benefit of refugees and \r\nother persons of concern under its mandate.\r\nThis year, as delegations are aware, is an especially \r\nimportant one for the UNHCR omnibus draft resolution. \r\nThe New York Declaration stipulates that the global \r\ncompact on refugees is to be presented to the Assembly \r\nfor its consideration in conjunction with the UNHCR \r\ndraft resolution. The compact is the tool kit that will \r\nhelp us deliver a more effective response, putting the \r\nrights and potential of refugees and their hosts at the \r\nheart of a more comprehensive approach.\r\nWe look forward to assessing our common progress \r\nat the first Global Refugee Forum, to be held in one year’s \r\ntime. We commend UNHCR for the comprehensive and \r\ntransparent process of consultation it conducted with \r\nMember States in Geneva to develop the global compact \r\non refugees, and we underline the importance of its \r\nimplementation. Once implemented and supported, it \r\nhas the potential to strengthen international solidarity \r\nand responsibility, sharing and paving the way for a \r\nmore effective, collective response to one of the central \r\nglobal challenges of our time.\r\nThe UNHCR omnibus resolution has to date always \r\nbeen adopted by consensus in the General Assembly \r\nand has never been adopted by vote. Our colleagues \r\nin Geneva worked hard for over a month to agree on \r\nimportant changes and additions to this year’s draft \r\nresolution. At its adoption in the Third Committee \r\nsome weeks ago, an overwhelming majority of Member \r\nStates expressed their support for it and the work of \r\nUNHCR.\r\nAs a facilitator of this year’s draft resolution and \r\non behalf of the Nordic countries, I today encourage \r\nall Member States to support it and vote in favour of its \r\nadoption by the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Schulz (Germany): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of France, the Netherlands and \r\nmy own country, Germany.\r\nTwo years ago we adopted the New York \r\nDeclaration for Refugees and Migrants, recognizing \r\nthat more equitable burden- and responsibility-sharing \r\nis indispensable if we want to provide sustainable \r\nsolutions for the world’s refugees and those who host \r\nthem. The global compact on refugees is a major step \r\nin that direction. It is, however, not only a historical \r\nnecessity but also a great opportunity to modernize \r\nand enhance refugee responses. It will serve as a \r\ntoolbox to address and respond effectively to various \r\nsituations that may arise and as a platform to build new \r\npartnerships. Its real added value will be its capacity to \r\nmobilize more States and stakeholders around common \r\nobjectives, with mutual commitments to address needs \r\nat national and regional levels.\r\nThe development of the global compact on refugees \r\nwas guided and inspired by the practical application of \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 9/35\r\nthe comprehensive refugee response framework over \r\nthe past two years. The framework has been a catalyst \r\nfor change and has generated positive, concrete results \r\nfor refugees and host communities in a number of \r\ncountries. Its roll-out in Central America and the Horn \r\nof Africa are great examples of what such broad-based \r\nprocesses can deliver on the ground.\r\nBy affirming the compact, we demonstrate once more \r\nour shared conviction that solidarity and cooperation \r\nare the only way to effectively address today’s refugee \r\nmovements. Germany, France and the Netherlands have \r\ncontributed their share and will continue to do so. We \r\nstrongly commend the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for its \r\nleadership in the significant and sometimes difficult \r\nprocess it was tasked with, culminating in the first-\r\never global compact on refugees. We sincerely thank \r\nthe Swedish facilitation team for its relentless efforts, \r\nwhich led to the successful completion of this year’s \r\ndraft resolution on the UNHCR (draft resolution II.)\r\nGermany, France and the Netherlands stand firmly \r\nbehind the global compact on refugees and look forward \r\nto starting its implementation through the adoption of \r\nthe UNHCR omnibus draft resolution by the General \r\nAssembly. That will signal a tangible shift towards a new, \r\ncomprehensive way of approaching refugee protection \r\nand solutions. It will also confirm the political will and \r\nambition of the international community in addressing \r\nforced displacements worldwide.\r\nGermany, France and the Netherlands will vote in \r\nfavour of the adoption of the draft resolution before us. \r\nWe urge all Member States to do the same. Let us seize \r\nthis unique, probably once-in-a-generation, opportunity \r\nto open a new chapter in our joint endeavour: to provide \r\nsupport and solutions to the millions of refugees around \r\nthe world and those who generously host them.\r\nMr. Al-Khalil (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): The global compact on refugees is the outcome \r\nof consultations, and not negotiations. It is therefore not \r\nbinding on Member States.\r\nMy delegation reiterates that there is a need for \r\ncommitment to the principles of professionalism, \r\nneutrality and non-politicization , while respecting the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. The Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees should \r\nincrease its efforts to facilitate the voluntary return \r\nof refugees, including Syrian refugees, and to support \r\nthe relevant efforts of the Syrian Government. Racist \r\npractices, discrimination and xenophobia against \r\nrefugees, including Syrians, must also be eliminated.\r\nMs. González (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): Venezuela recognizes the importance \r\nof draft resolution II in the context of implementing the \r\ncommitments of the 2016 New York Declaration for \r\nRefugees and Migrants. We appreciate the efforts of \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees (UNHCR) in proposing a global compact \r\nfor refugees, which could be implemented voluntarily \r\naccording to the guiding principles.\r\n Much work remains to be done to ensure that \r\nthe concerns of developing countries and the main \r\nhost countries are taken into account during the \r\nimplementation of the compact. We welcome the support \r\nin the text for the voluntary return and repatriation, as it \r\nfully recognizes the rights of citizens to remain in their \r\ncountries of origin if they so wish. We wish to highlight \r\nthat this right must never be prevented or affected by \r\nthe implementation of coercive unilateral measures or \r\nother forms of neocolonialism, blockades or foreign \r\nintervention aimed at paralysing the economic and \r\nsocial development of States.\r\nVenezuela recognizes the positive contributions \r\nof the global compact. However, we must warn that \r\nits implementation must strictly adhere to its guiding \r\nprinciples and to the purposes and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations. We urge against any effort to convert it \r\ninto a tool for intervention that could be used by some \r\nStates. No manipulation or selective interpretation of its \r\nobjectives should be accepted, nor should its provisions \r\nbe made more f lexible.\r\nWe therefore urge that due respect be paid to \r\nUNHCR’s mandate, established by the statute of \r\nresolution 428 (V), of 1950, and resolution 46/182, on \r\nstrengthening coordination for emergency humanitarian \r\nrelief and humanitarian principles. Humanitarian \r\nprinciples are fundamental and must guarantee the \r\nnon-politicization of its implementation, in particular \r\nwhen linked to mechanisms for the distribution of \r\nburden and responsibilities, such as support platforms \r\nor forums on refugees.\r\nFor those reasons Venezuela will vote in favour of \r\nthis draft resolution.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We will now \r\ntake decisions on draft resolutions I and II one by one.\r\nA/73/PV.55 17/12/2018\r\n10/35 18-44315\r\nDraft resolution I is entitled “Assistance to refugees, \r\nreturnees and displaced persons in Africa”. The Third \r\nCommittee adopted it without a vote. May I take it that \r\nthe Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nDraft resolution I was adopted (resolution 73/150).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Draft resolution \r\nII is entitled “Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees”. A recorded vote has \r\nbeen requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, \r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, \r\nBenin, Bhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, \r\nBurundi, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, \r\nCanada, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, \r\nChina, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech \r\nRepublic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nDenmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Ecuador, Egypt, El \r\nSalvador, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, Eswatini, \r\nEthiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, \r\nGeorgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, \r\nGuatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, \r\nHonduras, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic \r\nRepublic of), Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, \r\nJordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \r\nLatvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Liechtenstein, \r\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, \r\nMalaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Marshall Islands, \r\nMauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, \r\nMontenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, \r\nNamibia, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, \r\nNicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, \r\nPakistan, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, \r\nParaguay, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, \r\nRepublic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, \r\nRussian Federation, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, \r\nSaint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nSamoa, San Marino, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi \r\nArabia, Senegal, Serbia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, \r\nSingapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, \r\nSomalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Spain, Sri \r\nLanka, Sudan, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, \r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-\r\nLeste, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, \r\nTuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland, United Republic of Tanzania, Uruguay, \r\nUzbekistan, Vanuatu, Venezuela (Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of), Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nHungary, United States of America\r\nAbstaining:\r\nDominican Republic, Eritrea, Libya\r\nDraft resolution II was adopted by 181 votes to 2, \r\nwith 3 abstentions (resolution 73/151).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Before giving \r\nthe f loor to speakers in explanation of vote on the \r\nresolutions just adopted, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations are limited to 10 minutes and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Bogyay (Hungary): Hungary is a strong, long-\r\ntime supporter of the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and its mandate. \r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to the full implementation \r\nof the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to \r\nthe Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. We are \r\ngrateful to UNHCR and humanitarian personnel for \r\ntheir tireless work to deliver a humanitarian response \r\nto the needs of refugees, internally displaced persons \r\nand other persons of concern.\r\nBudapest hosts the UNHCR regional office \r\nand shared service centre for Central Europe, with \r\ngenerous long-term support from the Hungarian \r\nGovernment, which is, again, a token of Hungary’s \r\ncommitment to UNHCR and the cause it represents. \r\nHowever, the Hungarian Government has decided not \r\nto join the global compact on refugees. As Hungary \r\nindicated during the negotiations on the document in \r\nGeneva, the Government considers that the existing \r\ninternational legal framework adequately addresses \r\nrefugee and asylum matters; consequently, the \r\nGovernment considers that there is no necessity for a \r\nnew instrument in that regard. It is also concerned that \r\nthe differentiation between refugees and migrants, as \r\nwell as the voluntary nature of responsibility-sharing, \r\nare not adequately reflected in the compact.\r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 11/35\r\nFor those reasons, the Hungarian Government \r\nis not in a position to agree with paragraphs 23 and \r\n24 of resolution 73/151, which affirm and call for the \r\nimplementation of the global compact on refugees. \r\nTherefore, Hungry voted against resolution 73/151.\r\nMr. Kashaev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We voted in favour of resolution 73/151. We \r\nthank the sponsors and the delegation of Sweden for \r\npreparing the draft. We believe that the effect of the work \r\nof Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees (UNHCR) on strengthening international \r\nprotection for refugees, internally displaced persons \r\nand stateless persons is relevant and necessary. We will \r\ncontinue to provide comprehensive support to UNHCR.\r\nRegarding the global compact on refugees, we \r\nwould like to note the following. We believe that the \r\ncompact will facilitate the protection of the rights \r\nand improvement of the situation of refugees and will \r\nstrengthen the effectiveness of the work of UNHCR \r\nwithin its existing mandate. We would once again like \r\nto reiterate our position on the use of responsibility-\r\nsharing. We interpret that term, under the 1951 \r\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees and its \r\n1967 Protocol, as the solidarity of the global community \r\nin addressing the problem of refugees.\r\nWe also believe that a decision to host refugees \r\ncan be taken only by the host country, in accordance \r\nwith its national legislation and its international \r\nobligations. The rights of refugees do not extend to \r\npersons who have committed crimes against peace, war \r\ncrimes or crimes against humanity. We believe that the \r\nresponsibility of States to grant labour rights, social \r\nsupport and Government assistance to refugees applies \r\nonly to refugees who are legally present in the territory \r\nof that country. We also believe that climate change, \r\nenvironmental degradation and natural disasters \r\ncannot be construed under international law as reasons \r\nfor refugee displacement.\r\nGiven those considerations, we believe the \r\nprovisions in the global compact on refugees are not \r\nlegally binding and do not place any obligations, \r\nincluding legal and financial obligations, on the \r\nRussian Federation.\r\nMs. Shoman Khot (Jordan): I would like to \r\nreiterate my country’s support for resolution 73/151. \r\nIn that regard, we would like to explain the following \r\npoints with regard to the global compact on refugees.\r\nThroughout the process, the delegation of Jordan \r\nindicated clearly its position with regard to the New \r\nYork Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, the \r\ncomprehensive refugee response framework and the \r\nglobal compact on refugees. As a major traditional \r\nhost country, we believe in the importance of \r\noperationalizing the principles of solidarity and \r\nburden- and responsibility-sharing and of establishing \r\nthe necessary mechanisms or arrangements to \r\nimplement them.\r\nThe New York Declaration committed to more \r\nequitable burden- and responsibility-sharing, as well as \r\nto support for host countries and communities. There \r\nwas also a commitment to strengthen the resilience of \r\nhost countries and communities and of community-\r\nbased development programmes that benefit both \r\nrefugees and host communities. It is our understanding \r\nthat the compact does not alter that. That understanding \r\nand the points that follow from it guide our position on \r\nthe New York Declaration, the comprehensive refugee \r\nresponse framework and the compact.\r\nNothing in the text or the context of implementation \r\nof the compact, the comprehensive refugee response \r\nframework and the New York Declaration may be \r\ninterpreted as altering what is stipulated in the 1951 \r\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees, which \r\nclearly states that the Convention shall not apply to \r\npersons who are at present receiving protection or \r\nassistance from organs or agencies of the United \r\nNations other than the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees.\r\nNothing in the New York Declaration, the compact \r\nor the comprehensive refugee response framework may \r\nbe interpreted in a way that would extend the scope \r\nor change the definition of the term refugee, confirm \r\nrights or expand the scope of protection to subjects \r\nthat do not enjoy them, or redefine the principle of \r\nnon-refoulement and/or extend its scope of application \r\nto categories that this principle had not intended to \r\ncover in the 1951 Convention, when State security is at \r\nrisk or we rightly interpret the sovereign right of a State \r\nto control its border.\r\nJordan does not consider itself bound or committed \r\nto regional or international instruments listed to which \r\nit is not party, or to guidelines or other international \r\ndecisions, conclusions or resolutions on which we \r\nmade clear our position, or to reports and outcomes \r\nof non-intergovernmental processes that we have not \r\nA/73/PV.55 17/12/2018\r\n12/35 18-44315\r\nparticipated in or endorsed. That is true, for example, \r\nwith respect to the instruments on statelessness and \r\nmigration. The same position also applies to references \r\nand footnotes.\r\nRefugee status ceases once the reason that had \r\nled to identifying the status as stipulated in the 1951 \r\nConvention ceases to exist. Countries of origin should \r\nreceive their nationals upon that eventuality. States \r\nmust readmit their returning nationals and ensure that \r\nthey are received without undue delay.\r\nOn solutions, our understanding is that other local \r\nsolutions referred to are temporary and are interim \r\nsolutions that are subject to international cooperation \r\nand solidarity and burden-sharing. The root causes of \r\nf light in countries of origin should be addressed and \r\nrelevant solutions in those countries should be found to \r\nprevent movement in the first place or, should movement \r\ntake place, to create the conditions for return.\r\nMr. Iglesias Mori (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nChile welcomes resolution 73/151 in line with our \r\nnational legislation, in particular the provisions of Law \r\nNo. 20430, which regulates the matter in our country. \r\nWe reaffirm Chile’s long-standing contribution to the \r\ninternational community with respect to refugees, \r\nwhich we will always continue. Chile considers the \r\nneeds of asylum seekers in the light of our country’s \r\navailable means and resources.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in explanation of vote on this item. \r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 65.\r\nAgenda item 69\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/584)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nhas before it a draft resolution recommended by the \r\nThird Committee in paragraph 11 of its report, entitled \r\n“Report of the Human Rights Council”. We will now \r\ntake a decision on the draft resolution. A recorded vote \r\nhas been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, \r\nBahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, \r\nBhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Botswana, \r\nBrazil, Brunei Darussalam, Burkina Faso, Burundi, \r\nCabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African \r\nRepublic, Chad, Chile, China, Colombia, Comoros, \r\nCongo, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican \r\nRepublic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial \r\nGuinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, \r\nGambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, \r\nGuinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, \r\nIndonesia, Iraq, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic, Lebanon, \r\nLesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, \r\nMalaysia, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, \r\nMexico, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, \r\nNamibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, \r\nPakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, \r\nQatar, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, \r\nSenegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, \r\nSomalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, \r\nSudan, Suriname, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Tuvalu, Uganda, \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, United Republic of Tanzania, \r\nUruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic \r\nof), Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nBelarus, Israel, Myanmar, United States of America\r\nAbstaining:\r\nAlbania, Andorra, Armenia, Australia, Austria, \r\nBelgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, \r\nCanada, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech \r\nRepublic, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\nDenmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, \r\nGermany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Iran (Islamic \r\nRepublic of), Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, \r\nLatvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMalta, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, New \r\nZealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Poland, \r\nPortugal, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, \r\nRomania, Samoa, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, \r\nSlovenia, Solomon Islands, Spain, Sweden, \r\nSwitzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, \r\nUkraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland, Uzbekistan\r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 13/35\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted by 121 votes to 4, \r\nwith 60 abstentions (resolution 73/152).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Before giving \r\nthe f loor to those representatives who wish to speak \r\nin explanation of vote on the resolution just adopted, \r\nmay I remind delegations that explanations are limited \r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Poveda Brito (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela voted in favour of resolution 73/152, on \r\nthe basis of a position of principle. We reaffirm the \r\nimportance of this subsidiary body of the General \r\nAssembly as the supreme body on this very important \r\nmatter with regard to cooperation and dialogue \r\nwith States.\r\nHowever, Venezuela affirms its condemnation of \r\nthe adoption of resolutions and special procedures or \r\nany other mechanism on the human rights situation \r\nin specific countries. Furthermore, we reject the \r\nselective manner in which this process is handled and \r\nits politically motivated objectives, which constitute a \r\nviolation of the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Therefore, Venezuela disassociates itself from \r\ndocument HRC/39/1.\r\nThe continued practice of the selective adoption \r\nof resolutions regarding human rights situations in \r\nspecific countries goes beyond the competencies of \r\nthe Human Rights Council and violates the principles \r\nof universality, objectivity and non-selectivity with \r\nwhich all human rights topics should be approached. \r\nCooperation and dialogue are the appropriate means, \r\nas well as essential principles, for achieving the \r\neffective promotion and protection of human rights. In \r\nthat regard, we support the positions reiterated by the \r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries in this area.\r\nVenezuela calls for strengthening the positive \r\nprogress made since the establishment of the Human \r\nRights Council. We wish to see the Universal Periodic \r\nReview adopted as the preferred formula for cooperation \r\nwhen addressing human rights matters. We also call \r\nfor the practice of selective adoption of resolutions \r\nby countries to be eliminated, as it undermines the \r\nmandate of the Human Rights Council.\r\nMs. Ndayishimiye (Burundi) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to make the following statement following \r\nthe adoption of resolution 73/152. \r\nWhile we support the report in its entirety, my \r\ndelegation would like to reiterate its position of \r\nprinciple. We are concerned by certain aspects of the \r\nreport, especially as concerns the resolution, which \r\ntargets and singles out specific countries, including \r\nBurundi. Burundi remains convinced that any progress \r\nin the area of human rights must come through \r\ndialogue, cooperation and the Universal Periodic \r\nReview mechanism.\r\nWithout repeating what we already stated at \r\nthe Third Committee, my delegation would like to \r\ndissociate itself from the section of the report that \r\ntargets Burundi, in particular all passages pertaining to \r\nthe Commission of Inquiry on Burundi.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in explanation of vote on the resolution \r\njust adopted.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 69?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 70\r\nPromotion and protection of the rights of children\r\n(a) Promotion and protection of the rights of \r\nchildren\r\n(b) Follow-up to the outcome of the special session \r\non children\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/585)\r\nDraft amendment (A/73/L.59)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nhas before it three draft resolutions recommended by the \r\nThird Committee in paragraph 56 of its report, as well \r\nas one draft decision recommended by the Committee \r\nin paragraph 57 of the same report. In connection with \r\ndraft resolution III, the Assembly has before it a draft \r\namendment circulated in document A/73/L.59.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to representatives who wish \r\nto speak in explanations of vote before the voting, may \r\nI remind delegations that explanations are limited to \r\n10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMrs. Ahmed (Sudan): As previously and clearly \r\nstated, my delegation has serious reservations regarding \r\nthe inclusion in draft resolution III of any references \r\nA/73/PV.55 17/12/2018\r\n14/35 18-44315\r\nto the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) and the gratuitous use of the draft resolution to \r\ncall for, propagate and exert unacceptable pressure on \r\nMember States to include such references and language, \r\nwhich jeopardize the ongoing peacebuilding efforts in \r\nmy country aimed at safeguarding the rights of children \r\nin the Sudan.\r\nAs Member States are aware, the delisting of the \r\nSudan from the group of States in which the rights of \r\nchildren are violated, in the context of the currently \r\nde-escalating conflict in Darfur, is a milestone \r\nachievement. Since the year 2003 and throughout the \r\nlong period during which we addressed the conflict \r\nin Darfur, the International Criminal Court has been \r\nan impediment to peace. All efforts towards lasting \r\npeace were hampered by the ICC simply because of its \r\ninterference, which has always been malignant since its \r\nentry into force in 2002. At best, the ICC is a threat to \r\nstability and peace in my country.\r\nThe ICC is not an organ of the United Nations, \r\nin spite of the repeated attempts by some parties to \r\nmaintain otherwise at meetings of the Main Committees \r\nof the General Assembly. Since 2008, at consecutive \r\nAfrican Union Summits, Heads of State have decided \r\nnot to cooperate with the ICC until pending issues \r\nregarding the questions related to articles 13, 17 and \r\n98 of the Rome Statute are answered and the targeting \r\nof African leaders as a way of showing that the ICC is \r\nfunctional has ceased. At its ministerial conference in \r\nApril 2018, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries \r\nsupported that position.\r\nMy delegation distances itself from the Court and, \r\nas such, kindly refers the Assembly to the amendment \r\ncontained in document A/73/L.59, with regard to \r\nparagraph 51 of the draft resolution on the rights of the \r\nchild. We request that it be put to the vote and call upon \r\nMember States to support our amendment by deleting \r\nthe following words at the end of the paragraph:\r\n“and calls upon the international community to hold \r\nthose responsible for violations accountable, inter \r\nalia, through the International Criminal Court”.\r\nMr. Paolino Laborde (Uruguay) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Paragraph 51 of the draft resolution includes \r\nthe agreed language on children and armed conflict that \r\nhas been adopted every year for more than 10 years. \r\nThe paragraph calls upon States to protect children \r\naffected by armed conflict, in particular from violations \r\nof international humanitarian law and human rights \r\nlaw, and to ensure that they receive timely, effective \r\nhumanitarian assistance, while noting the efforts \r\ntaken to end impunity by ensuring accountability and \r\npunishing perpetrators, and calls upon the international \r\ncommunity to hold those responsible for violations \r\naccountable, inter alia, through the International \r\nCriminal Court.\r\nThe Court is the main permanent court established \r\nto end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes against individuals and their rights that are of \r\nconcern to the international community, as a whole. \r\nSuch crimes include violations of the rights of the \r\nchild. It represents an important achievement of the \r\ninternational community in its effort to create a rules-\r\nbased world order and a key instrument for ensuring \r\nthat those accused of committing serious crimes, under \r\nthe principle of complementarity, are tried before the \r\nCourt in full respect of their rights and international law, \r\nthereby promoting the global fight against impunity.\r\nThe role of the Court in protecting children in \r\nsituations of armed conflict is clearly stipulated in the \r\nvarious provisions of the Rome Statute, in particular in \r\narticles 6, 7, 8, 36, 42, 54 and 68. In that regard, a clear \r\nreference to the Court in the draft resolution is vital \r\nand all the more relevant given the case Prosecutor \r\nv. Thomas Lubanga and his sentencing for recruiting \r\nand enlisting children under 15 to engage in hostile \r\nactivities, as well as other cases now before the Court.\r\nFor those reasons, the main sponsors of the draft \r\nresolution understand that the language of paragraph \r\n51 pertaining to the International Criminal Court is not \r\nonly accurate in terms of rights but also very relevant \r\nand timely. We must therefore retain it as part of the \r\ntext, as has been agreed for several years now. For those \r\nreasons, we cannot accept the draft amendment. The \r\nmain sponsors of the draft resolution call for it to be put \r\nto the vote. We will vote against the draft amendment \r\nand urge other delegations to do the same.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We shall now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolutions I to III and the draft \r\ndecision, one by one.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution I, entitled “Child, \r\nearly and forced marriage”.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nA single, separate recorded vote has been requested \r\nby the United States on the twenty-third preambular \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 15/35\r\nparagraph and operative paragraphs 14, 17 and 18 of \r\ndraft resolution I.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, \r\nArgentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, \r\nBahrain, Belgium, Belize, Bolivia (Plurinational \r\nState of), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, \r\nBrazil, Bulgaria, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Canada, \r\nChad, Chile, China, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, \r\nCosta Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, \r\nCzech Republic, Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nDenmark, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, \r\nEgypt, El Salvador, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, \r\nFinland, France, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, \r\nGuinea, Guinea-Bissau, Hungary, Iceland, India, \r\nIndonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, \r\nKenya, Kiribati, Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, \r\nLibya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMadagascar, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, \r\nMexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, \r\nMozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands, New \r\nZealand, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, \r\nPanama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, \r\nPhilippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of \r\nKorea, Romania, Rwanda, Samoa, San Marino, \r\nSao Tome and Principe, Serbia, Seychelles, \r\nSierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, \r\nSolomon Islands, South Africa, South Sudan, \r\nSpain, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nTimor-Leste, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Vanuatu, \r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, \r\nZambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst\r\nNauru, United States of America\r\nAbstaining\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Bangladesh, Barbados, \r\nBelarus, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, \r\nEquatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, \r\nHonduras, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kuwait, \r\nMalaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Russian \r\nFederation, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nSaudi Arabia, Senegal, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, \r\nTogo, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, United Arab \r\nEmirates, Yemen\r\nThe twenty-third preambular paragraph and \r\noperative paragraphs 14, 17 and 18 were retained \r\nby 134 votes to 2, with 32 abstentions.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Third \r\nCommittee adopted draft resolution I, as a whole, \r\nwithout a vote.

The \r\nThird Committee adopted it without a vote.

The Assembly has \r\nbefore it a draft amendment, which was circulated as \r\ndocument A/73/L.59. In accordance with article 90 of \r\nthe rules of the procedure, the Assembly will first take \r\na decision on the draft amendment.

May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same?\r\nDraft resolution III was adopted (resolution \r\n73/155).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We will now \r\nturn to paragraph 57 of the report to take action on the \r\ndraft decision entitled “Document considered by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in connection with the promotion \r\nand protection of the rights of children”. The Third \r\nCommittee adopted it without a vote. May I take it that \r\nthe Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted (decision 73/524).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now give \r\nthe f loor to those representatives who wish to speak in \r\nexplanation of vote or position on the resolutions and \r\ndecision just adopted.\r\nMs. Korac (United States of America): We regret \r\nthat we were unable to deliver this statement at the time \r\nof adoption in the Third Committee, but wish to take \r\nthis opportunity to provide clarification of the United \r\nStates position regarding elements of this important \r\nresolution, entitled “Child, early and forced marriage” \r\n(resolution 73/153). \r\nWe regret that the United States proposal to delete \r\npreambular paragraph 23 and paragraphs 14, 17 and 18 \r\nwas not adopted. The United States disassociates itself \r\nfrom preambular paragraph 23 and paragraphs 14, \r\n17, and 18 because of its concerns about wording that \r\nexceeds prior international consensus on issues related \r\nto reproductive health care.\r\nThe United States believes that women should \r\nhave equal access to reproductive health care. We \r\nremain committed to the commitments set out in the \r\nBeijing Declaration and the Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment. As has been made clear over many years, \r\nthere is international consensus that the Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action do not create new international \r\nrights, including any right to abortion. The United \r\nStates fully supports the principle of voluntary choice \r\nregarding maternal and child health and family \r\nplanning. We do not recognize abortion as a method of \r\nfamily planning or support abortion in our reproductive \r\nhealth assistance. We also note that the United States \r\nis the largest bilateral donor of reproductive health and \r\nfamily planning assistance.\r\nWith regard to this resolution’s references to the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we note \r\nthat we addressed our concerns during the Third \r\nCommittee session. The United States understands that \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions do not change the current \r\nstate of conventional or customary international law, or \r\ndoes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights itself \r\ncreate legal obligations. We do not read this resolution \r\nto imply that States must join or implement obligations \r\nunder international instruments to which they are \r\nnot party, and the United States understands that any \r\nreaffirmation of prior documents applies only to those \r\nStates that affirmed them initially and, in the case of \r\ninternational treaties or conventions, to those States \r\nthat are party to them.\r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 17/35\r\nWe note that in the United States decisions \r\nregarding education funding and curricular and other \r\neducation policies, materials and programmes are \r\nmade as appropriate and consistent with our respective \r\nfederal, state or local authorities. We also note that any \r\npotential actions to address school-related violence, \r\nincluding sexual and gender-based violence, should be \r\nconsistent with applicable due process protections.\r\nMr. Iglesias Mori (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\ndelegation of Chile wishes to express its reservations \r\nconcerning the eighth preambular paragraph and \r\nparagraphs 35, 36, 37 and 38 of resolution 73/155, on \r\nrights of the child.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): May I take it \r\nthat it is the wish of the General Assembly to conclude \r\nits consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 70?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The General \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 70 and its sub-item (a).\r\nMr. Ten-Pow (Guyana), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nAgenda item 71\r\nRights of indigenous peoples\r\n(a) Rights of indigenous peoples\r\n(b) Follow-up to the outcome document of the \r\nhigh-level plenary meeting of the General \r\nAssembly known as the World Conference on \r\nIndigenous Peoples.\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/586)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before \r\nit a draft resolution, entitled “Rights of indigenous \r\npeoples”, recommended by the Third Committee in \r\nparagraph 8 of its report.\r\nWe will now take a decision on the draft resolution. \r\nThe Third Committee adopted it without a vote. May I \r\ntake it that the Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution \r\n73/156).\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nthe representative of Chile, who wishes to speak in \r\nexplanation of position on the resolution just adopted.\r\nMr. Iglesias Mori (Chile): The delegation of Chile \r\nwishes to express its reservations with regard to the \r\nseventh preambular paragraph of resolution 73/156.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of Agenda item 71?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 71 and its sub-item (a).\r\nAgenda item 72\r\nElimination of racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance\r\n(a) Elimination of racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance\r\n(b) Comprehensive implementation of and follow-\r\nup to the Durban Declaration and Programme \r\nof Action\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/587)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before it \r\ntwo draft resolutions recommended by the Committee \r\nin paragraph 26 of its report.\r\nBefore proceeding further, I should like to inform \r\nmembers that action on draft resolution II, entitled “A \r\nglobal call for concrete action for the total elimination \r\nof racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance and the comprehensive implementation \r\nof and follow-up to the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action” is postponed to a later date to \r\nallow time for the review of its programme budget \r\nimplications by the Fifth Committee. The Assembly \r\nwill take action on draft resolution II as soon as the \r\nreport of the Fifth Committee on its programme budget \r\nimplications is available.\r\nThe General Assembly will now take a decision on \r\ndraft resolution I.

May I take it that \r\nthe Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nDraft resolution III was adopted (resolution \r\n73/160).\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Kyrgyzstan, who wishes to speak in \r\nexplanation of position on the resolution just adopted.\r\nMr. Omurzakov (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic is firmly committed to the \r\nnorms and principles of international law, one of \r\nwhich is the right of peoples to self-determination. We \r\nnote with satisfaction that the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations unanimously supported the adoption \r\nof resolution 73/160, thereby demonstrating their \r\ncommitment to the ideals of freedom, independence \r\nand the equality of all States and peoples of the world. \r\nThe delegation of Kyrgyzstan would like to express its \r\nthanks to the delegation of Pakistan for its work on the \r\nresolution. \r\nKyrgyzstan has consistently expressed its support \r\nfor the resolution and is a sponsor of it. We believe it is \r\na significant symbolic document that demonstrates the \r\nimportance of the right of peoples to determine their \r\nown destiny. However, we also want to point out that \r\nthe principle of the self-determination of peoples should \r\nnot be interpreted as permitting or encouraging any \r\naction that partially or wholly violates or undermines \r\nthe territorial integrity or political unity of sovereign \r\nindependent States, as expressed in the Declaration on \r\nPrinciples of International Law concerning Friendly \r\nRelations and Cooperation among States in accordance \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations, adopted on \r\n24 October 1970.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 73?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 74\r\nPromotion and protection of human rights\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/589)\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to inform \r\nmembers that we will take action on sub-items (a) to (d) \r\nof agenda item 74 immediately after taking action on \r\nthe main agenda item.\r\nThe Assembly has before it a draft resolution \r\nrecommended by the Third Committee in paragraph 9 \r\nof its report, as well as a draft decision recommended \r\nby the Committee in paragraph 10 of the same report.\r\nWe will now take a decision on the draft resolution \r\nand on the draft decision, one by one.\r\nWe turn first to the draft resolution, entitled “World \r\nBraille Day”. The Third Committee adopted it without \r\na vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do \r\nthe same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 73/161).\r\nThe Acting President: We now turn to the draft \r\ndecision, entitled “Documents considered by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in connection with the question of \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights”. The \r\nThird Committee adopted it without a vote. May I take \r\nit that the Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted (decision 73/525).\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 74.\r\n(a) Implementation of human rights instruments\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/589/Add.1)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before it a \r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Third Committee \r\nin paragraph 21 of its report. We shall now take a \r\ndecision on the draft resolution, entitled “Human rights \r\ntreaty body system”. The Third Committee adopted it \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 73/162).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 74?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n(b) Human rights questions, including alternative \r\napproaches for improving the effective \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 21/35\r\nenjoyment of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/589/Add.2)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before \r\nit 17 draft resolutions recommended by the Third \r\nCommittee in paragraph 162 of its report.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSudan to introduce draft amendments A/73/L.57 and \r\nA/73/L.58.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to thank you, Sir, for giving me the f loor for the \r\nthird time today.\r\nMy country’s delegation would like to submit two \r\ndraft amendments, contained in documents A/73/L.57 \r\nand A/73/L.58, to draft resolution X, recommended in \r\nthe report of the Third Committee (A/73/589/Add.2) \r\nand entitled “Extrajudicial summary or arbitrary \r\nexecutions”. The first amendment is to delete the \r\nfifteenth preambular paragraph, and the second \r\namendment is to delete paragraph 13, which both refer \r\nto the International Criminal Court (ICC). After it was \r\ncompletely impossible to achieve consensus in that \r\nregard with the facilitators of the draft resolution, we \r\nhave a reservation on the reference to the ICC for the \r\nfollowing reasons.\r\nFirst, not all Member States are party to the Rome \r\nStatute, and no specific legal system may be imposed \r\nas a basic benchmark or reference through all or any \r\nattempt to globalize the ICC system. On 14 December, \r\nwe indicated in the Security Council the structural \r\ndeformities in the Statute of the ICC when we were \r\ndeliberating the twenty-eighth report submitted by \r\nthe Prosecutor of the ICC (see S/PV.8425). We also \r\nmentioned the gaps and loopholes that became apparent \r\nafter the Statute entered into force, in 2001, and \r\ncategorically demonstrated that corruption is not related \r\nto only one or two persons in the ICC. The corruption \r\nof the Court discourages us from taking it seriously. \r\nWe also stated that such corruption is institutional and \r\nintegral to the ICC, the Rome Statute and the practices \r\nthereof. During the past 13 years the ICC has proven \r\nitself to be notorious, given its corruption, which States \r\nand the media are aware of. In that regard, I would \r\nlike to refer to the article in Der Spiegel magazine few \r\nmonths ago with regard to the corruption of the ICC.\r\n As a result of that, confidence in the ICC is \r\ndwindling and weakening. We respect those that have \r\nchosen to be party to the ICC, but we do not agree on \r\nimposing it as the single legal system throughout the \r\nworld. We insist on reconsidering the international \r\ncriminal system so that it is commensurate with the \r\nhopes and aspirations of the founders of the United \r\nNations in 1945 when they began thinking of building \r\nan international criminal system. Nobody at that time \r\nthought that the results would be so deplorable.\r\nGiven the fact that the international criminal system \r\nis related to the criminal responsibility of individuals \r\nand natural persons, we must bear in mind that 60 per \r\ncent of human beings are outside the legal jurisdiction \r\nof the ICC. We say 60 per cent of human beings because \r\nthe jurisdiction of the ICC applies to natural persons. \r\nTherefore, it is totally unacceptable for such persons \r\nto be subjected to a jurisdiction that does not apply \r\nto them, in accordance with the peremptory principle \r\nof international law, which states that no crime can \r\nbe established without a text. Those structural f laws \r\nin the current Statute must be reconsidered sooner \r\nor later. We are confident that will take place. Also, \r\nwe know that the Rome Statute lacks integrity and \r\nneutrality. That can be seen in its practice, because the \r\nICC has exercised its jurisdiction only over the African \r\ncontinent and its leaders.\r\nSecondly, the ICC is considered a political \r\ninstrument for the achievement of specific and narrow \r\ninterests. The lack of credibility and neutrality of the \r\nICC was evident in the successive withdrawals by \r\ncountries from its Statute. Given the fact that we are \r\nnot party to the Rome Statute, we have reservation with \r\nregard to any reference contained in the draft resolution \r\nbefore us to the Rome Statute, which established the \r\nICC. In that connection, my delegation would like to \r\nassert that no liabilities may be imposed on any country \r\nbeyond its sovereign right to be party or not to be party \r\nto a Treaty.\r\nThere is another point that has been raised: that the \r\nSudan requested a recorded vote on these paragraphs \r\nin various draft resolutions of the Committees and \r\nthe General Assembly recently. Actually, the Sudan, \r\nfrom the very beginning, has been very consistent with \r\nregard to its reservations to the ICC and any attempts to \r\ninclude it in United Nations resolutions, because doing \r\nso causes clear division and shameful polarization \r\namong Member States, which we want to avoid.\r\nThe Sudan has never changed its objection against \r\nthe ICC, we changed only the way in which we object \r\nA/73/PV.55 17/12/2018\r\n22/35 18-44315\r\nto the Rome Statute. As a State Member of the United \r\nNations, we are totally free to choose the method by \r\nwhich we object to the jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nTherefore, my delegation urges other countries \r\nto support the two draft amendments that we are \r\nintroducing now, which we previously introduced in the \r\nThird Committee, and to vote in favour of them.\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now give the f loor \r\nto delegations wishing to speak in explanation of vote \r\nor position on any or all of the 17 draft resolutions \r\ncontained in document A/73/589/Add.2 and on the two \r\ndraft amendments to draft resolution X.\r\nMs. Ferry (Monaco) (spoke in French) Under \r\nsub-item (b), entitled “Human rights questions, \r\nincluding alternative approaches for improving the \r\neffective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms”, of agenda item 74, entitled “Promotion \r\nand protection of human rights”, Monaco intended to \r\nco-sponsor draft resolution XII, entitled “Terrorism \r\nand human rights”.\r\nMr. Tanner (Finland): It is with deep regret that \r\nmy delegation notes draft amendments A/73/L.57 \r\nand A/73/L.58, proposed by the delegation of the \r\nSudan, to the fifteenth preambular paragraph and \r\noperative paragraph 13 of draft resolution X, entitled \r\n“Extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions”, which \r\nrefer to the Rome Statute. The draft amendments were \r\ndefeated by clear numbers in the Third Committee. \r\nOn behalf of the Nordic countries, Finland reiterates \r\nits unwavering support for the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) as an important tool of the international \r\ncommunity for fighting impunity and contributing to \r\npeaceful societies. The gross violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights law that we \r\nwitness worldwide, especially extrajudicial summary \r\nand arbitrary executions, are a sharp reminder of the \r\nincreasing relevance of the Court, the role of which \r\nis to complement rather than replace national justice \r\nsystems. The primary responsibility for investigating \r\nand prosecuting the most serious crimes remains with \r\nindividual States. All perpetrators of such crimes must \r\nbe held accountable for their actions.\r\nA key element in the Rome Statute is its equal \r\napplication. In that respect, the creation of the ICC \r\ngave millions of victims of atrocity crimes new hope \r\nthat justice would be done. States from all over the \r\nworld have joined efforts to make that possible, which \r\nis especially important to remember this year as we \r\ncelebrate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Rome Statute. As we look back on the history \r\nof its existence, the impact that the Court has had in \r\naddressing impunity is clear. \r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nFor those reasons, Finland and the co-sponsors \r\nof draft resolution X will vote against those draft \r\namendments. We call on all other States, in particular \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute, to also vote “no”. \r\nMr. Mohamed (Maldives): I take the f loor to \r\nprovide an explanation of our vote before the voting on \r\ndraft resolution XIII, entitled “Moratorium on the use \r\nof the death penalty”.\r\nWhile the death penalty has remained a prescribed \r\nform of punishment in the Maldives for decades, we \r\nare proud of the fact that an informal moratorium on \r\nits use has been in existence since 1954, for more than \r\n60 years. It was only in 2014 that the Maldives enacted \r\nits new penal code, which specifically prescribes the \r\nuse of the death penalty for premeditated murder and \r\ndeliberate manslaughter, which states that punishments \r\nfor crimes for which retribution or the restoration of \r\njustice is required must be carried out according to \r\nthe principles of Islamic sharia. Article 10 of the \r\nConstitution of Maldives stipulates that Islam should be \r\nthe basis of all laws in the country. We fully maintain \r\nthat legal measures in Islamic sharia relating to the use \r\nof this punishment must be rigorously and meticulously \r\nexamined within the judicial framework to ensure that \r\nthe enforcement of sentences is not arbitrary. \r\nHowever, we also agree that the Maldives must \r\nundertake a thorough process in which the judicial \r\nframework, especially the criminal justice system \r\nin its entirety, must be reformed, strengthened \r\nand institutionalized. It is the intention of the new \r\nGovernment to ensure that the process of reform is \r\ncarried out without delay and with the deliberate \r\npurpose of having an independent and impartial \r\njudiciary in the Maldives that commands the trust and \r\nconfidence of the general public. \r\nThe reality is that the death penalty remains on \r\nthe books. To favour its abolition without wider public \r\nconsultation and referendums, and without preceeding \r\ndomestic legislation to nullify its implementation, \r\nwould be both unconstitutional and undemocratic. It is \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 23/35\r\nagainst that backdrop that we must take measures with \r\na view to the task ahead. \r\nThe Maldives will uphold its existing informal \r\nmoratorium on the use of the death penalty. We will also \r\nwork in tandem with our international and domestic \r\npartners to bring about positive and meaningful changes \r\nto the judiciary so that it can function independently \r\nand impartially in its administration of justice. \r\nDuring the deliberations at the Third Committee \r\nin November, the Maldives voted against the draft \r\nresolution that is before us. While the Government \r\nis committed to maintaining the moratorium, for the \r\nlegal reasons I just outlined the Maldives will maintain \r\nits position in the plenary and vote “no” on the draft \r\nresolution entitled “Moratorium on the use of the death \r\npenalty”.\r\nMs. Wagner (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland would like to explain its vote on draft \r\nresolution III, entitled “United Nations Declaration on \r\nthe Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in \r\nRural Areas”. The draft resolution was adopted by the \r\nThird Committee on 19 November under sub-item (b) \r\nof agenda item 74. It is being addressed today in the \r\nreport contained in document A/73/589/Add.2. \r\nAlthough peasants produce the majority of food \r\nproducts in the world, they are at the same time \r\ndisproportionately affected by poverty. Switzerland is \r\ncommitted at the national and international levels to \r\nmaintaining and developing small-scale agricultural \r\nsystems. For that reason, Switzerland has in recent \r\nyears supported the development of the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People \r\nWorking in Rural Areas. We are co-sponsors of the \r\ndraft resolution for the mandate of the working group \r\nin Geneva. \r\nThe Declaration contained in the annex to the \r\ndraft resolution seeks to summarize the rights of \r\npeasants in a single document in order to better raise \r\nawareness about their situation. It is a very important \r\npolitical signal. Moreover, the new instrument is not \r\nlegally binding; existing norms are therefore not called \r\ninto question by the Declaration. Switzerland took \r\npart in the negotiations on the Declaration in an open \r\nand constructive spirit. We welcome the fact that the \r\nmajority of our concerns were taken into account. From \r\nour point of view, the process led to a positive and \r\nlargely balanced results. \r\nFor the reasons I mentioned, Switzerland voted \r\nin favour at the Human Rights Council and the Third \r\nCommittee, but we did so with an explanation of vote \r\nto underscore the fact that the content and wording that \r\nSwitzerland would have preferred was not reflected \r\nthroughout the entire text of the Declaration and that \r\nthe Declaration contains certain provisions that are \r\nproblematic for Switzerland. We will today once again \r\nvote in favour of the draft resolution and the new \r\nDeclaration contained in the annex while repeating the \r\nfollowing points. \r\nFirst, we would like to underscore that the agrarian \r\nreforms mentioned in article 17, paragraph 6, would \r\nrequire a legal procedure with the necessary legal \r\nsafeguards, and that the expropriation of lands with a \r\nview to their redistribution should be accompanied by \r\nfair compensation. \r\nSecondly, in our view, article 19, on the right to \r\nseeds, contains problematic provisions, in particular \r\nwith regard to intellectual property, which Switzerland \r\nwill interpret in line with its national laws and \r\ninternational law. We refer specifically to paragraphs \r\n1 (a), 1 (d), 4 and 8.\r\nFinally, we would like to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the fact that the Declaration does not \r\nadequately reference the existing international \r\nenvironmental regime and no longer incorporates \r\nsustainable development. While such an approach is \r\nnecessary to ensure the rights of future generations of \r\npeasants, we regret the fact that the Declaration does \r\nnot sufficiently mention the obligations tied to the rights \r\nof various stakeholders, for example, the obligation to \r\nimplement environmental conventions. It is with those \r\nclarifications that Switzerland will vote in favour of the \r\ndraft resolution.\r\nMr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I would like to refer to the statement made by \r\nmy colleague His Excellency the Ambassador of the \r\nRepublic of the Sudan with regard to draft amendments \r\nA/73/L.57 and A/73/L.58 to draft resolution X, as \r\nrecommended in the report of the Third Committee \r\n(A/73/589/Add.2). \r\nI note that my delegation supports the draft \r\namendments put forward by the representative of the \r\nSudan with regard to voting on the fifteenth preambular \r\nparagraph and paragraph 13 of draft resolution X with \r\na view to deleting them. We support putting those two \r\nA/73/PV.55 17/12/2018\r\n24/35 18-44315\r\nparagraphs to the vote for the reasons explained by the \r\nrepresentative of the Sudan.\r\nMr. Gebru (Ethiopia): In explanation of vote \r\nbefore the voting on draft declaration III, entitled \r\n“United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants \r\nand Other People Working in Rural Areas”, I would like \r\nto make the following points. \r\nFirst, I would like to express Ethiopia’s appreciation \r\nto the facilitators of the draft Declaration for their hard \r\nwork and the consultations they facilitated. \r\nSecondly, the Constitution of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia recognizes the rights \r\nof peasants and pastoralists, including the right to \r\nobtain land without payment and protection against \r\neviction from their possessions. It also recognized \r\nthe right of pastoralists to have access to free land \r\nfor grazing and cultivation. It is in that context that \r\nEthiopia constructively engaged in the negotiations on \r\nthe draft United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \r\nPeasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas. \r\nThirdly, we have, however, noted the expanded \r\nscope and application of the rights of peasants and other \r\npeople working in rural areas, particularly in the context \r\nof articles 7 and 21 of the draft Declaration, relating \r\nto transboundary tenure and water-related issues, \r\nrespectively. Ethiopia cannot accept the expanded the \r\nscope of articles 7 and 21 of the draft Declaration. We \r\nrecognize article 7 and 21 of the draft Declaration to be \r\nlimited to issues under the jurisdiction of States and not \r\napply to transboundary issues.\r\nFourthly, for Ethiopia, the draft Declaration is a \r\nnon-legally binding instrument. In international law \r\nand customary practice, the rights and duties of a State \r\nand its people are limited to the State’s territory and are \r\nsubject to its jurisdiction. That principle is explicitly \r\nprescribed in article 2, sub-article 1, of the International \r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and implicitly \r\nprescribed in all other international instruments. In line \r\nwith that principle, Ethiopia understands and would \r\nlike to underscore that the applicability and scope of the \r\ncurrent draft United Nations Declaration on the Rights \r\nof Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas \r\nare limited to the territory of each State and subject to \r\nits jurisdiction only.\r\nFifthly, Ethiopia appreciates the inclusion of \r\narticle 28 in the Declaration. We believe the article is \r\nappropriate because of the non-legally binding nature \r\nof the draft Declaration. In keeping the aspirational \r\nnature of the draft Declaration and our collective will \r\nto work for its realization, Ethiopia would like to put on \r\nrecord and reaffirm that the current and future national \r\nlaws of Ethiopia and its international obligations prevail \r\nover the Declaration. \r\nIt is with that interpretation and understanding that \r\nEthiopia will abstain in the voting on draft resolution \r\nIII. It is our sincere hope that our concerns will be \r\nproperly addressed in future negotiations so that we can \r\nalign ourselves with the entire Declaration in future. \r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now take decisions on draft resolutions I to XVII \r\none by one. After all the decisions have been taken, \r\nrepresentatives will again have an opportunity to \r\nexplain their votes or positions. \r\nWe first turn to draft resolution I, entitled “Human \r\nrights and extreme poverty”. The Third Committee \r\nadopted it without a vote. May I take it that the Assembly \r\nwishes to do the same?\r\nDraft resolution I was adopted (resolution 73/163).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Draft resolution \r\nII is entitled “Combating intolerance, negative \r\nstereotyping, stigmatization, discrimination, incitement \r\nto violence and violence against persons, based on \r\nreligion or belief”. The Third Committee adopted it \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same?\r\nDraft resolution II was adopted (resolution 73/164).\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Draft resolution \r\nIII is entitled “United Nations Declaration on the Rights \r\nof Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas”. \r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour\r\nAfghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Benin, \r\nBhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Botswana, \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Burundi, Cabo Verde, \r\nCambodia, Central African Republic, Chad, \r\nChile, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nCuba, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 25/35\r\nDominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, \r\nEl Salvador, Eritrea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, \r\nGrenada, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, \r\nHaiti, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic \r\nof), Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, \r\nKuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Luxembourg, \r\nMadagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, \r\nMauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, \r\nMorocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, \r\nNepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, \r\nPanama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, \r\nPortugal, Qatar, Republic of Moldova, Rwanda, \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi \r\nArabia, Senegal, Serbia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, \r\nSolomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, South \r\nSudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Switzer-\r\nland, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, \r\nTimor-Leste, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, \r\nUganda, United Arab Emirates, United Republic \r\nof Tanzania, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Venezuela \r\n(Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, Yemen, \r\nZambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst\r\nAustralia, Guatemala, Hungary, Israel, New \r\nZealand, Sweden, United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland, United States of America\r\nAbstaining\r\nAlbania, Andorra, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, \r\nBelgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, \r\nCameroon, Canada, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, \r\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Ethiopia, \r\nFiji, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, \r\nHonduras, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kiribati, \r\nLatvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, \r\nMontenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Palau, Poland, \r\nRepublic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, \r\nSamoa, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, \r\nSpain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nTurkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, Vanuatu\r\nDraft resolution III was adopted by 121 votes to 8, \r\nwith 54 abstentions (resolution 73/165). \r\n[Subsequently the delegation of China informed the \r\nSecretariat it had intended to vote in favour. ]\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Draft resolution \r\nIV is entitled “The right to development”.

The \r\nThird Committee adopted it without a vote. May I take \r\nit that the Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nDraft resolution XVII was adopted (resolution \r\n73/179).\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now give the f loor to \r\ndelegations wishing to speak in explanation of vote or \r\nposition after the adoption of the resolutions.\r\nMs. Simpson (United States of America): We are \r\npleased to maintain consensus on resolution 73/174, \r\nentitled “Terrorism and human rights”. We take the \r\nf loor today to fully state our understanding of the text.\r\nWe understand paragraph 8 of the resolution to \r\nrefer to the importance of ensuring access to justice \r\nand accountability in accordance with applicable \r\ninternational law. We also understand the reference in \r\nparagraph 9 to States acting in accordance with their \r\nobligations under international law to mean that, if a \r\nState carries out the stated actions within its criminal \r\njustice system, it should do so in a manner consistent \r\nwith its applicable international obligations; it should \r\nnot be understood to suggest the existence of particular \r\nobligations to implement the actions described.\r\nNothing in the resolution requesting States \r\nto take certain actions to counter terrorism alters \r\nStates’ obligations under applicable international law, \r\nincluding the decisions of the Security Council. We \r\nunderstand paragraph 13 to mean that States must \r\ncomply with their international obligations, including \r\nthe non-discrimination provisions of international \r\nhuman rights treaties to which they are party, as \r\napplicable, when taking measures to counter terrorism \r\nand violent extremism.\r\nWith respect to paragraph 14, we reject and dissociate \r\nfrom it as it is an unfair and thinly veiled attack against \r\nUnited States material support law. We reject its overly \r\nbroad call on States to ensure that counter-terrorism \r\nlegislation does not impede humanitarian aid, even if \r\nterrorists benefit from such activities. That could be \r\nread as exempting humanitarian activities from counter-\r\nterrorism legislation and other measures designed to \r\nprevent the provision of material support and resources \r\nto terrorist groups and individual terrorists for any \r\nreason. While we support the role humanitarian actors \r\nshould continue to have in alleviating the suffering of \r\nthose who are displaced and otherwise victimized by \r\nterrorism, we stress that there is no obligation under \r\ninternational law that countries allow the unrestricted \r\ndelivery of humanitarian or other assistance to terrorist \r\ngroups or individual terrorists, or that countries \r\nallow the provision of support to terrorist groups or \r\nindividual terrorists for any purported humanitarian or \r\nother activities they may pursue. That language has no \r\nimpact upon the binding obligation of Member States to \r\nprohibit their nationals or those within their territories \r\nfrom providing funds or other economic resources for \r\nthe benefit of terrorist organizations or to individual \r\nterrorists for any purpose, even in the absence of a \r\nlink to a specific terrorist act, regardless of whether \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 33/35\r\nor not such support is meant to further the terrorist, \r\nhumanitarian or any other goals or activities of a \r\nterrorist or terrorist organization. It is unfortunate that \r\nthe misleading and damaging language of paragraph 14 \r\nappears in the resolution.\r\nTo all those who may seek to rely on such language \r\nin future, we urge them to understand it as calling on \r\nStates to ensure only that their counter-terrorism efforts \r\nare implemented appropriately in a manner consistent \r\nwith their international obligations and to use future \r\nopportunities to correct that language accordingly. We \r\nare also concerned about the fact that the call on States \r\nnot to hinder the work of civil society organizations \r\nin paragraph 28 can be similarly misconstrued. We \r\nunderstand it to mean only that States must comply \r\nwith international obligations in that respect.\r\nFurthermore, we disassociate from paragraph 30, \r\ngiven its calls to prevent speech that goes beyond the \r\nnarrow exceptions to freedom of expression permitted \r\nby our Constitution and article 19 of the International \r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights. We are \r\ncommitted to cooperating to counter violent extremist \r\npropaganda and incitement to violence on the Internet \r\nand social media. But we believe the new language in \r\nthe paragraph goes too far and could be used to support \r\nexcessive restrictions on speech, in particular online.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nwould like to reiterate that we support the overall \r\nobjective of resolution 73/172, entitled “Extrajudicial \r\nsummary or arbitrary executions”, the draft form of \r\nwhich the Third Committee recommended in its report \r\n(A/73/589/Add.2). We abstained in the voting on the \r\ndraft resolution because some of its provisions address \r\ncontentious issues, concepts and ideas that have no \r\ninternational legal basis or consensus.\r\nIn that regard, I refer to concepts concerning sexual \r\norientation and sexual identity that are not included in \r\nany international human rights treaty. That contradicts \r\ninternational rules and benchmarks on human rights \r\nthat enjoy unanimity, and contradicts as well the basic \r\nprinciples that underpin many societies.\r\nAs members know, the resolution also contains \r\nreferences to the International Criminal Court, which \r\nwe asked members to vote against.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nsub-item (b) of agenda item 74.\r\n(c) Human rights situations and reports of special \r\nrapporteurs and representatives\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/589/\r\nAdd.3)\r\nDraft amendment (A/73/L.60)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before \r\nit five draft resolutions recommended by the Third \r\nCommittee in paragraph 88 of its report. In connection \r\nwith draft resolution I, the General Assembly has before \r\nit a draft amendment circulated in document A/73/L.60.\r\nBefore proceeding, I should like to inform members \r\nthat action on draft resolution III, entitled “The \r\nsituation of human rights in the Autonomous Republic \r\nof Crimea and the city of Sevastopol (Ukraine)”, and \r\ndraft resolution V, entitled “The situation of human \r\nrights in Myanmar”, is postponed to a later date to allow \r\ntime for a review of its programme budget implications \r\nby the Fifth Committee. The Assembly will take action \r\non draft resolutions III and V as soon as the reports \r\nof the Fifth Committee on their programme budget \r\nimplications are available.\r\nI shall now give the f loor to delegations wishing to \r\nspeak in explanation of vote or position.\r\nMr. Kim Song (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): My delegation strongly and totally rejects \r\ndraft resolution I, as contained in document A/73/589/\r\nAdd.3 and entitled “Situation of human rights in the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea”, which was \r\nsubmitted by the European Union and the Japan. The \r\ndraft resolution has nothing to do with genuine human \r\nrights, as it is the product of a political plot by hostile \r\nforces that try to disgrace the image of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and overthrow its political \r\nand social system. As we have made clear on several \r\noccasions, the human rights issues mentioned in the \r\ndraft resolution have never existed and cannot be \r\nallowed to exist in my country, where we greatly value \r\nthe dignity and rights of the human being.\r\nWith regard to the material contained in the draft \r\nresolution, those despicable false words were fabricated \r\nby a handful of defectors who escaped after having \r\ncommitted crimes in my country to sustain their dirty \r\nlives. Therefore, my delegation does not feel any need \r\nto even vote on the draft resolution, which is consistent \r\nwith the lying and the plots and distorts the real human \r\nrights situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea.\r\nA/73/PV.55 17/12/2018\r\n34/35 18-44315\r\nMy delegation expresses its deep concern and \r\nsurprise about the fact that the criminal State of Japan, \r\nwhich in the past committed class-A crimes against \r\nhumanity — such as kidnapping, forced enlistment \r\nand sexual slavery — is talking about human rights \r\nissues in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\ninstead of assuming responsibility for its dirty human \r\nrights record and officially apologizing and offering \r\ncompensation to victims. Furthermore, we will not look \r\non idly at the fact that the European Union and Japan \r\nare provoking confrontation by submitting the draft \r\nresolution against the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea by going against the prevailing trend on the \r\nKorean peninsula, at a time when the international \r\ncommunity is making diplomatic efforts to achieve a \r\npeaceful environment to promote our people’s well-\r\nbeing.\r\nAlthough the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea remains ready to attach great importance \r\nto dialogue and cooperation for the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights, it will strongly respond to \r\nput an end to provocative action, such as the adoption \r\nof the anti-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nhuman rights draft resolution under the pretext of \r\nnon-existent human rights issues. My delegation will \r\nneither recognize nor accept the forcibly railroaded \r\nanti-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea human \r\nrights draft resolution. We also never feel any need to \r\ncall for a vote.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation categorically rejects all \r\nthe draft resolutions against the Russian Federation, the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran and the Syrian Arab Republic, \r\nbased on our principled position against politicization, \r\nselectivity and double standards on human rights.\r\nMr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My delegation renews its full rejection of \r\ndraft resolution IV, entitled “The situation of human \r\nrights in the Syrian Arab Republic”, in both form and \r\ncontent. Procedurally, we stress that the key delegation \r\nthat submitted the draft resolution, namely, the Saudi \r\ndelegation, has no legal or ethical grounds to submit \r\nany draft resolution that deals with the situation of \r\nhuman rights anywhere in the world.\r\nWe confidently and sincerely believe that it is \r\nnecessary for Member States to reflect on the shameful \r\nsituation that we are currently experiencing, especially \r\nwhen we see that the representatives of the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia — the most dangerous and violent \r\nreligious dictatorship in the world — are submitting \r\ndraft resolutions on the human rights situation in Syria, \r\nwhich preceded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by many \r\nlight years in promoting and protecting human rights.\r\nOn its content, my country in principle opposes \r\nthe politicization of this issue and the fact that certain \r\npermanent Member States resort to submitting draft \r\nresolutions targeting specific States for political \r\nreasons, which everyone is aware of, especially given \r\nthat the draft resolution is imbalanced and aims to \r\ndistort facts and tarnish the image of my country’s \r\nGovernment and its legitimate institutions.\r\nThat is a reflection of the position of the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia and its destructive policies towards my \r\ncountry, which is based on its military and political \r\ninvestments in Wahhabi extremist terrorism with \r\na view to spreading chaos, toppling the legitimate \r\nGovernment, undermining the political process and \r\nnegatively impacting it, in violation of the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions that underscore that the \r\npolitical process is exclusively Syrian-owned, without \r\nany foreign intervention.\r\nThe royal family rules the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia with a sword, which is evident on the Kingdom’s \r\nf lag, using the ascendency of religion while Islam \r\nhas nothing to do with that. The royal family strives \r\nto use the surplus in oil revenues to exercise political \r\npressure and achieve financial polarization within \r\nthe Organization. It seeks to destroy the principles \r\nand well-established rules of the work of the United \r\nNations, as well as undermine the credibility, sincerity \r\nand balance of the Organization.\r\nMore clearly, the representatives of the Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia want members of the Assembly today to \r\nbecome accomplices and bear false witness to a draft \r\nresolution that calls for measures and well-established \r\ntraditions in Syria that have been applied for decades \r\nand centuries, namely, holding elections, possessing \r\na Constitution and electing a Parliament, while also \r\ngiving a role to women, protecting journalists and \r\nensuring the freedom of press. They are demanding \r\nall that while the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, since its \r\nestablishment until present, has not had a parliament, \r\na constitution or elections. Rather, it oppresses citizens \r\nand persecutes women, religious and ethnic minorities \r\nand expatriates. Recently, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \r\ndiscovered a new way to enjoy human rights, which was \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.55\r\n18-44315 35/35\r\nto use its diplomatic offices to kill and dismember a \r\ndissident Saudi journalist who opposed the royal family.\r\nThat raises the following question: Where is Saudi \r\nArabia on implementing those rightful demands as \r\nits people languish under the yoke of sheikhdoms, \r\nwhich have nothing to do with either parliaments \r\nor constitutions? Those sheikhdoms are ashamed \r\nof women in their communities, as was the case in \r\nthe pre-Islamic era when the population of those \r\nsheikhdoms used to bury baby girls alive because they \r\nwere ashamed of them.\r\nWe are not naïve, and we know fully well that \r\nthe delegation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has \r\nalways been a tool in the hands of those who support \r\nterrorism in my country, Syria. But whoever pushed \r\nthe Saudi delegation to submit that draft resolution is \r\na hypocrite and a liar. For eight years, the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia has been at the forefront of targeting \r\nstability and security in my country, Syria, within the \r\nGeneral Assembly by submitting a draft resolution on \r\nthe human rights situation and democracy in Syria.\r\nWe urge the majority of the States Members of \r\nthe Organization to not engage in such a farce, which \r\nhistory will prove is one of the setbacks of the United \r\nNations. How could it not be so when we are witnessing \r\nthe representatives of a State beheading people in its \r\nstreets under the pretext of religion while calling for \r\ndemocracy in a State with a well-established tradition \r\nand history of thousands of years, namely, Syria?\r\nSpeaking of hypocrisy and lying, many of the \r\ncountries that co-sponsored the draft resolution — and \r\nhere we single out those Governments that are members \r\nof the so-called global coalition — also partook in \r\nthe perpetration of the most abominable crimes that \r\nviolated human rights in Syria when they engaged in the \r\nillegitimate military operations under the leadership of \r\nthe United States of America and destroyed the city of \r\nRaqqa, killing thousands of its population. To date, their \r\nbodies are still buried under the rubble of the city. They \r\nalso participated in destroying bridges, infrastructure, \r\ngas stations, energy plants, agricultural land and \r\nfactories, as well as public and private properties, in the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic. In addition, they pillaged Syrian \r\nartefacts and cultural heritage and traded it, under the \r\nfalse pretext of combating Da’esh.\r\nThe adoption of this Saudi draft resolution will set \r\na serious precedent that will be used on any Member \r\nState when Governments that practice politicization \r\nand financial polarization target those who oppose \r\ntheir policies, hegemony and influence.\r\nAgain, I call on those present to be cautious as to the \r\nabnormal practices that some Member States are using \r\nto politicize human rights mechanisms and leverage \r\nthem as pressure on some Member States. The Syrian \r\nArab Republic considers voting in favour of this so-\r\ncalled Saudi draft resolution to be an act of aggression \r\nagainst Syria. We will spare no effort to exercise our \r\nsovereign national rights and take all measures against \r\nthe co-sponsors and those who vote in favour of it, so \r\nas to isolate them from any contribution or role in the \r\nSyrian-owned political process. Furthermore, we will \r\nensure their exclusion from any reconstruction efforts.\r\nWe believe that there are Governments that \r\nhave to appease the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for \r\npolitical reasons or financial considerations, but those \r\nGovernments should do so either by being silent with \r\nregard to the Kingdom’s record, which is replete with \r\nhuman rights violations, or situations that are related to \r\nthem, and not at the expense of my country, Syria, and \r\nthe fate and freely expressed independent aspirations \r\nof its people. Again, my country’s delegation requests \r\na recorded vote on this draft resolution, and urges \r\nMember States to vote against it.\r\nIn conclusion, I congratulate Saudi Arabia and the \r\nother Arab States that co-sponsored this draft resolution \r\non the inclusion of Israel on the list of co-sponsors. That \r\ndemonstrates the nature and motives of Saudi Arabia, \r\nwhile the Saudi-Israeli coalition exposes the nature of \r\nsuch a draft resolution.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the interpreters for \r\ntheir forbearance. We have heard the last speaker in \r\nexplanation of vote for this meeting. We shall hear the \r\nremaining speakers at 3 p.m. here in the Hall, followed \r\nby consideration of the remaining reports of the Third \r\nCommittee. The Assembly will then consider sub-item \r\n(b) of agenda items 3, sub-item (a) of agenda item 34 \r\nand sub-item (b) of agenda item 116.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
