"United Nations A/73/PV.56\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n56th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 17 December 2018, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Korneliou \r\n(Cyprus), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 74 (continued)\r\nPromotion and protection of human rights\r\n(c) Human rights situations and reports of special \r\nrapporteurs and representatives\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/589/\r\nAdd.3)\r\nDraft amendment (A/73/L.60)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ncontinue to hear explanations of vote before the voting.\r\nI first give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSudan to introduce draft amendment A/73/L.60.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nUnfortunately, the consensus, if not unanimity, that the \r\nGeneral Assembly enjoyed while voting on a number \r\nof issues has been undermined through an initiative \r\nlaunched by several States, in particular our friends \r\nin the European Union, to include a call to join the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in draft resolutions that \r\ndeal with such issues. Over time, such referrals have \r\nled to extreme polarization, particularly following the \r\ndecision taken by some States to refer to the authority \r\nof the International Criminal Court as an integral part \r\nof their foreign policies. Those States seek to link \r\nhumanitarian assistance and economic cooperation with \r\nthe stance of other countries towards the Court. That \r\nhas coincided with the Court’s attempts to single out \r\nAfrica and its leaders exclusively, which has had serious \r\npolitical and strategic repercussions for countries that \r\nare targeted by the Court if they try to depart from its \r\nregional jurisdiction on the African continent.\r\nThe number of cases that are currently before \r\nthe Court, the pending cases in its chambers and the \r\nexorbitant amount of money spent on each case very \r\nclearly illustrate that the International Criminal Court \r\nhas not succeeded and will not succeed in effectively \r\nfulfilling its mandate, given its unacceptable selectivity, \r\nwhile it claims to be an independent judicial body. Those \r\nissues add to the danger posed by the Court due to its \r\nf lagrant activity, clear preference and political bias, \r\nwhile trying to single out African leaders with arrest \r\nwarrants and putting political considerations before \r\nreconciliation, peace and post-conflict rehabilitation. \r\nAll those factors pose an imminent danger for social \r\npeace and national unity in developing countries. The \r\nCourt has simultaneously undermined peace and justice.\r\nWith regard to draft resolution I, entitled “Situation \r\nof human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea”, since 2014 we have faced serious obstacles \r\nfrom proponents of the Court. In accordance with the \r\nrules of procedure, we therefore wish to introduce draft \r\namendment A/73/L.60, which proposes the deletion of \r\noperative paragraph 12. We call on Member States to \r\nvote in favour of it.\r\nMr. Hassani Nejad Pirkouhi (Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran): I deliver this statement in relation to draft \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n18-44309 (E)\r\n*1844309*\r\n \r\nA/73/PV.56 17/12/2018\r\n2/26 18-44309\r\nresolution II, on the so-called situation of human rights \r\nin the Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\nThis is another unfortunate instance of the General \r\nAssembly being forced into taking a deeply biased \r\nand politicized decision, which further erodes the \r\ncredibility of the United Nations. This political charade, \r\nwhich is annually orchestrated by Canada, has only one \r\nobjective: to put political pressure on my people by \r\nabusing the noble cause of human rights.\r\nThere are no greater adversaries to human rights \r\nand democracy than the countries that conveniently \r\nexploit those belonging to the nations and Governments \r\nthey dislike. In fact, the biggest threat to human rights \r\ncomes from hypocrisy, politicization and double \r\nstandards. Such Governments are not confronting \r\ntheir political foes; rather, they are condemning the \r\ncause of human rights itself. Their foreign policies, by \r\ndefault, are run on hypocrisy, inconsistency and double \r\nstandards. That is clearly reflected in the behaviour of \r\nthe main proponents of draft resolution II, presented \r\nby Canada.\r\nCanada needs to realize that such a pointless and \r\nfutile exercise disrespects the wisdom of the people \r\nwho observe its selective stance on the issue of human \r\nrights. Sadly, each year the main sponsors of the draft \r\nresolution wage a vigorous campaign of pressure and \r\nintimidation, while collecting votes by putting pressure \r\non Member States. Reaping votes by threatening cuts \r\nin financial or development funds will not contribute \r\nto promoting human rights; rather, it further exposes \r\nthe dishonesty of such States and should be viewed as \r\nanother clear assault on the cause of human rights.\r\nThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nrecognizes that promoting and protecting the human \r\nrights of its citizens is not only a legal and moral \r\nresponsibility, but also a paramount requirement of \r\nits national security. During the past four decades, the \r\npeople’s voice, expressed through ballots, has decided \r\nthe country’s overall policies in both internal and \r\nforeign affairs. Regardless of the challenges, Iranians \r\nwill never give up their enthusiasm for human rights \r\nand their dreams for democracy.\r\nSimilar to other countries, deficiencies may exist, \r\nwhich we are determined to address. However, it is not \r\nfor those countries that traditionally, historically and \r\npractically supported colonialism, slavery, racism, \r\napartheid, torture, pre-emptive wars and interventions \r\nto lecture Iranians on human rights. Those are the same \r\ncountries that openly glorify terrorists and separatists, \r\nincluding in the very draft resolution that the General \r\nAssembly will act upon. Those are exactly the States \r\nthat are brazenly committing crimes against humanity \r\nby weaponizing food, drugs and medicines, imposing \r\nunilateral sanctions against civilians in my country \r\nand elsewhere.\r\nWe regret that a few unscrupulous Governments \r\ncontinue to challenge the integrity and credibility of \r\nthe United Nations by forcing it to make decisions that \r\nare absolutely irrelevant to the realities on the ground. \r\nThe Assembly may have already decided how to vote, \r\nbut please remember that rejecting and voting against \r\nthis futile draft resolution is a step in the right direction \r\ntowards the protection and promotion of human rights. \r\nPlease remember that, unlike those few that have \r\nhistorically abused human rights as instruments in \r\ntheir foreign policy tool boxes, Iran continues to \r\nearnestly believe in dialogue that is based on mutual \r\nunderstanding, cooperation and respect in order to \r\npromote and protect human rights.\r\nMr. Kickert (Austria): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and its \r\nmember States.\r\nWe deeply regret that the Sudan has yet again \r\nintroduced a draft amendment (A/73/L.60) seeking to \r\ndelete references to the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC). That issue has already been duly considered \r\nin the Third Committee and this morning (see A/73/\r\nPV.55), and the outcome of that consideration was a \r\nclear rejection of the respective draft amendment.\r\nThe EU and its member States consider the fight \r\nagainst impunity for the most serious crimes as critical \r\nto ensuring a fair and just society and sustainable \r\npeace, with perpetrators held accountable and justice \r\nensured for victims. We also believe that peace and \r\njustice are complementary and not mutually exclusive. \r\nWe are strong supporters of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, which is a key institution that assists victims in \r\nachieving justice when confronted with the most serious \r\ncrimes, when that is not possible at the national level.\r\nAll perpetrators of such crimes must be held \r\naccountable for their actions. The creation of the ICC \r\nhas given millions of victims of atrocity crimes, many \r\nof whom are African, new hope that justice will be \r\ndone. States from all over the world have joined efforts \r\nto make that possible. The 28 States members of the \r\nEuropean Union will therefore vote against the draft \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.56\r\n18-44309 3/26\r\namendment proposed by the Sudan. We call on all \r\nother States, in particular States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, to also vote \r\nagainst it.\r\nMr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Our delegation has traditionally refrained \r\nfrom supporting so-called country-specific draft \r\nresolutions on human rights, which are often based on \r\nunreliable information and have little to do with the \r\nreal state of affairs. Such openly political initiatives \r\ndiscredit the human rights structures of the United \r\nNations. Rather than continuing the counterproductive \r\npractice of making unfounded accusations, we should \r\nfocus our efforts on establishing cooperation on an \r\nequal footing and a basis of mutual respect.\r\nWe outlined our position on country-specific draft \r\nresolutions in the Third Committee, and it has not \r\nchanged. We will vote against the draft resolutions \r\non the human rights situations in Iran, Myanmar and \r\nSyria, and we dissociate ourselves from the consensus \r\non the draft resolution on the situation of human rights \r\nin the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): I have the honour \r\nof delivering this statement on behalf of Andorra, \r\nAustria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, the \r\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, \r\nGermany, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, \r\nJapan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Monaco, the \r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal. \r\nQatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, \r\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and my \r\nown country, Liechtenstein.\r\nDraft resolution IV, entitled “Situation of human \r\nrights in the Syrian Arab Republic”, again this year \r\nreflects recent developments in the atrocious human \r\nrights situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, as set \r\nout in the reports of the accountability mechanism, \r\nthe International, Impartial and Independent \r\nMechanism; the Organization for the Prohibition of \r\nChemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative \r\nMechanism; the Independent International Commission \r\nof Inquiry; as well as the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and many brave \r\ncivil society actors.\r\nWe are deeply concerned about the well-documented \r\nabhorrent crimes that constitute serious violations \r\nof international law, in particular international law, \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights law, in many cases \r\namounting to war crimes or crimes against humanity. \r\nWe welcome the draft resolution’s emphasis on the need \r\nfor accountability and continue to reiterate our call on \r\nthe Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to \r\nthe International Criminal Court, which can ensure \r\na comprehensive judicial process for all the relevant \r\ncrimes committed by all actors in Syria.\r\nIn the absence of a Security Council referral, \r\nthe General Assembly has taken a much-needed \r\nfirst step to close the immense immunity gap by \r\ncreating the International, Impartial and Independent \r\nMechanism, which is carrying out its functions with \r\nremarkable effectiveness and success. With the \r\noverwhelming support of the General Assembly, the \r\nInternational, Impartial and Independent Mechanism \r\nis fully operational and discharges its mandate in a \r\ndiligent manner, with the seriousness and breadth of \r\nexpertise needed, to prepare case files for the many \r\ndifferent grave crimes committed. We welcome that \r\nthe draft resolution before us supports those efforts in \r\npractical terms.\r\nParagraph 31 mandates the International, Impartial \r\nand Independent Mechanism to present its reports on \r\nan annual basis to the plenary of the General Assembly, \r\nunder the existing agenda item entitled “Prevention \r\nof armed conflict”, under which the International, \r\nImpartial and Independent Mechanism was created \r\ntwo years ago. The paragraph is fully in line with the \r\nexisting rules of procedure of the General Assembly \r\nand adds clarification to the relationship of the General \r\nAssembly and its subsidiary body the International, \r\nImpartial and Independent Mechanism.\r\nParagraph 32 notes the steps taken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in response to last year’s decision to include \r\nthe necessary funding for the Mechanism in his next \r\nbudget proposal. The transfer of the Mechanism’s \r\nfunding from voluntary contributions to the regular \r\nbudget corresponds to the wish of a large majority of \r\nStates that agreed to it last year. It does not come with \r\nprogramme budget implications, as incorrectly claimed \r\nby some. With those provisions, the draft resolution \r\nmakes an important contribution to the quest for justice \r\nfor victims of the crimes committed in the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic. We call upon all States to vote in favour of \r\nthe draft resolution and to oppose attempts to amend \r\nor alter it.\r\nMr. Budhu (Trinidad and Tobago): I have the \r\nhonour to deliver this explanation of vote before the \r\nA/73/PV.56 17/12/2018\r\n4/26 18-44309\r\nvoting on a number of draft resolutions presented under \r\nsub-item (c) of agenda item 74.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is committed to upholding the \r\nrule of law at the national and international levels. In that \r\nregard, our Constitution, which is our supreme law, has \r\nentrenched fundamental human rights and freedoms, in \r\nkeeping with our legally binding obligations that arise \r\nfrom various global and hemispheric human rights \r\ninstruments. Consequently, we condemn all violations \r\nof human rights, wherever they are committed, as \r\nwe subscribe to the view that the human rights of the \r\nindividual are inviolable. As a responsible member \r\nof the international community, we are committed \r\nto ensuring that all human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms are globally promoted and protected.\r\nHowever, Trinidad and Tobago wishes to recall \r\nthat the Human Rights Council, an independent \r\nand impartial body, was established by the General \r\nAssembly to address violations of human rights \r\nin Member States, including through its Universal \r\nPeriodic Review process and its special procedures. \r\nAdditionally, it must also be recalled that human rights \r\ntreaty bodies established by different conventions \r\nand treaties contribute to addressing human rights \r\nviolations through monitoring the implementation of \r\ntreaties by States parties.\r\nAccordingly, we have some difficulty with the \r\nselectivity with which draft resolutions were put \r\nforward on the situation of human rights in certain \r\ncountries and the apparent politicization of those issues \r\nin this forum. Trinidad and Tobago submits that the \r\nHuman Rights Council and treaty bodies should be \r\nallowed to discharge their mandates and to examine in \r\na dispassionate manner the question of human rights \r\nviolations in any Member State. We also subscribe \r\nto the view that mutual dialogue, cooperation and \r\nunderstanding are key to improving human rights \r\nsituations, as they contribute to creating an environment \r\nin which there can be meaningful action.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago therefore encourages all \r\nMember States to cooperate with the Human Rights \r\nCouncil special procedures and treaty bodies in that \r\nregard. For those reasons, Trinidad and Tobago will \r\nabstain in the voting on the draft resolutions submitted \r\nunder sub-item (c) of agenda item 74.\r\nMr. Kim Song (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): I already made a statement this morning (see \r\nA/73/PV.55) with regard to sub-item (c) of agenda item \r\n74, so I will not repeat the same things again. I will, \r\nhowever, very briefly emphasize the key points of my \r\nstatement for the General Assembly’s understanding.\r\nFirst, my delegation totally and categorically \r\nrejects draft resolution I, entitled “Situation of human \r\nrights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea”, \r\nas a product of a political plot by hostile forces aimed \r\nat disgracing the image of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and overthrowing our political and \r\nsocial system.\r\nSecondly, the text of the draft resolution is consistent \r\nwith the ongoing lies and that plot and severely distorts \r\nthe real human rights situation in my country.\r\nThirdly, the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea maintains a consistent and principled position of \r\nsolving all issues through dialogue and negotiation. We \r\ncannot compromise with confrontational approaches, \r\nsuch as that of the draft resolution presented by the \r\nEuropean Union and Japan, and we will not be forced \r\nto adopt the draft resolution against my country.\r\nFinally, we neither recognize nor accept the draft \r\nresolution, and therefore never feel any need to call for \r\na vote.\r\nMr. Poveda Brito (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela wishes to explain its position \r\nregarding the draft resolutions under sub-item (c) of \r\nagenda item 74, to be acted upon in this meeting and \r\nrelating to country-specific human rights situations, \r\nnamely, draft resolution I, on the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, draft resolution II, on the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, and draft resolution IV, on the Syrian \r\nArab Republic.\r\nIn that regard, Venezuela wishes to reaffirm its \r\nprincipled position with regard to the adoption of draft \r\nresolutions, special procedures and other mechanisms \r\non country-specific human rights situations, while \r\nrejecting politically motivated selectivity in addressing \r\nthose issues, as that constitutes a violation of the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. As \r\nwell as exceeding the remit of the Committees of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the continued practice of selectively \r\nadopting draft resolutions relating to country-specific \r\nhuman rights situations violates the principles of \r\nuniversality, objectivity and non-selectivity that we \r\nshould employ when addressing human rights issues.\r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.56\r\n18-44309 5/26\r\nCooperation and dialogue are the appropriate \r\nmeans and essential principles for effectively promoting \r\nand protecting human rights. In that regard, we support \r\nthe ongoing calls of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries concerning this issue. Venezuela urges \r\nStates to build on the positive progress made since the \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council and to foster \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review mechanism as a form of \r\ncooperation to address the issue of human rights. We \r\ncall for the elimination of the practice of selectively \r\nadopting draft resolutions concerning countries, which \r\nweakens the mandate of the Human Rights Council.\r\nFinally, on the basis of our principled position, \r\nVenezuela will vote against the draft resolutions to be \r\nput to the vote and we disassociate ourselves from the \r\nconsensus on draft resolution I.\r\nMr. Xing Jisheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): China \r\nconsistently maintains that human rights differences \r\nshould be resolved through constructive dialogue and \r\ncooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect. \r\nWe reject the politicization of human rights issues and \r\nthe exertion of pressure on other countries under the \r\npretence of human rights. We also reject the practice of \r\ncountry-specific human rights draft resolutions.\r\nIn view of those reasons, the Chinese delegation \r\nwill not join the consensus on draft resolution I, on \r\nthe human rights situation in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, and will also vote against other \r\nhuman rights-related country-specific draft resolutions.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake action on draft resolutions I, II and IV.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution I, entitled “Situation \r\nof human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea”. In connection with draft resolution I, the \r\nGeneral Assembly has before it a draft amendment \r\ncirculated in document A/73/L.60. In accordance \r\nwith rule 90 of the rules of procedure, the Assembly \r\nshall first take a decision on the draft amendment. A \r\nrecorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nBahrain, Belarus, Burundi, China, Cuba, \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Egypt, \r\nIran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Oman, Pakistan, \r\nRussian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, \r\nSouth Sudan, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, \r\nYemen, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nAlbania, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, \r\nArmenia, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, \r\nBelize, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, \r\nBrazil, Bulgaria, Cabo Verde, Canada, Chile, \r\nColombia, Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, \r\nCyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican \r\nRepublic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Fiji, \r\nFinland, France, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, \r\nGhana, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, \r\nIceland, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, \r\nLatvia, Lebanon, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, \r\nLuxembourg, Malawi, Maldives, Malta, Marshall \r\nIslands, Mexico, Micronesia (Federated States \r\nof), Monaco, Montenegro, Namibia, Netherlands, \r\nNew Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, \r\nPeru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Republic of \r\nKorea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis, Samoa, San Marino, Senegal, Serbia, \r\nSierra Leone, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, \r\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Timor-Leste, Trinidad \r\nand Tobago, Tunisia, Ukraine, United Kingdom \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Uruguay, \r\nVanuatu, Zambia\r\nAbstaining:\r\nAlgeria, Angola, Barbados, Bhutan, Brunei \r\nDarussalam, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central \r\nAfrican Republic, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, \r\nGuinea-Bissau, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Israel, \r\nJordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Mali, Mauritius, \r\nMorocco, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Papua New \r\nGuinea, Qatar, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nSingapore, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Thailand, Togo, \r\nTurkey, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania, United States of America, \r\nViet Nam\r\nDraft amendment A/73/L.60 was rejected by 95 \r\nvotes to 19, with 43 abstentions.\r\nThe Acting President: We now turn to draft \r\nresolution I, as a whole. The Third Committee adopted \r\nit without a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same?\r\nA/73/PV.56 17/12/2018\r\n6/26 18-44309\r\nDraft resolution I, as a whole, was adopted \r\n(resolution 73/180).\r\nThe Acting President: Draft resolution II is entitled \r\n“Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran”.

We call on all parties to \r\nrespect their commitments under international human \r\nrights law and international humanitarian law, and \r\nto providing the necessary protection to defenceless \r\ncivilians. Tunisia also calls for all perpetrators of \r\ncrimes and grave violations of human rights to be \r\nheld accountable and to ensure that they do not enjoy \r\nimpunity. My country is convinced that, if all parties \r\nreject escalations of violence, mitigate the suffering of \r\nthe Syrian people and respect human rights, we will be \r\nable to create a political climate conducive to moving \r\nforward towards a complete resolution of the Syrian \r\ncrisis, under the auspices of the United Nations. That \r\nwill enable our brotherly Syrian people to re-establish \r\npeace and security and look towards reconstruction \r\nand development.\r\nMr. Hassani Nejad Pirkouhi (Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran): My delegation disassociates itself from the \r\nconsensus on resolution 73/180, entitled “Situation \r\nof human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea”. In our view, the resolution takes a \r\ncounter-productive and confrontational approach \r\nand contravenes the principles of universality, \r\nnon-selectivity and objectivity in addressing human \r\nrights issues.\r\nMr. Cepero Aguilar (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Cuban delegation disassociates itself from the \r\nconsensus on resolution 73/180, entitled “Situation of \r\nhuman rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea”, in line with our stance against the imposition \r\nof selective and politically motivated resolutions \r\nand mandates. We believe that genuine international \r\ncooperation based on the principles of objectivity, \r\nimpartiality and non-selectivity is the only way to \r\neffectively promote and protect all human rights.\r\nWe urge that, in this case, as in others, the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism be given the opportunity to \r\nfoster a discussion free of politicization or confrontation \r\nand to stimulate respectful cooperation with the country \r\nconcerned. The resolution continues down the path of \r\nsanctions and dangerously and counter-productively \r\ninvolves the Security Council in matters that do not fall \r\nunder its remit.\r\nCuba can therefore not join the consensus on a \r\nresolution that seeks to safeguard Security Council \r\npunishment and sanctions in situations that do not \r\ninfringe on international peace and security. We cannot \r\nbe complicit in the attempts to deny the people of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea their right \r\nto peace, self-determination and development. We \r\nwish to point out that the opposition to this selective \r\nand politicized mandate does not promote any value \r\njudgement on the other outstanding issues that are set \r\nout in the twentieth paragraph. Those call for a fair \r\nand honourable solution, with the agreement of all \r\ninterested parties.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Saudi Arabia on a point of order.\r\nMr. Khashaan (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nFirst, my country’s delegation would like to point out \r\nthat the name of my country is the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nA/73/PV.56 17/12/2018\r\n8/26 18-44309\r\nArabia, not the Saudi regime. Moreover, my country’s \r\ndelegation refuses to enter into the mire into which the \r\nSyrian delegation is dragging us.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nsub-item (c) of agenda item 74.\r\n(d) Comprehensive implementation of and follow-\r\nup to the Vienna Declaration and Programme \r\nof Action\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/589/\r\nAdd.4)\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly wishes to take note of the report of \r\nthe Third Committee?\r\nIt was so decided (decision 73/526).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (d) of agenda item 74?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 74.\r\nAgenda item 109\r\nCrime prevention and criminal justice\r\nReport of the Third Committee (A/73/590)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before \r\nit nine draft resolutions recommended by the Third \r\nCommittee in paragraph 45 of its report and a draft \r\ndecision recommended by the Committee in paragraph \r\n46 of the same report.

The Committee adopted it without \r\na vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do \r\nthe same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution \r\n73/193).\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who \r\nwishes to speak in explanation of postion following the \r\nresolution just adopted.\r\nMr. Mamdouhi (Islamic Republic of Iran): My \r\ndelegation joined the consensus on resolution 73/193, \r\njust adopted. However, I would like to express my \r\ndelegation’s reservations about the parts of the \r\nreport contained in document A/73/600 and in the \r\nresolution that could be construed as recognizing the \r\nIsraeli regime.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 3 and of \r\nagenda item 3 as a whole?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.56\r\n18-44309 11/26\r\nAgenda item 34\r\nPrevention of armed conflict\r\n(a) Prevention of armed conflict\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/73/295)\r\nDraft resolution (A/73/L.47)\r\nDraft amendment (A/73/L.68)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Ukraine to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.47.\r\nMr. Kyslytsya (Ukraine): Draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.47, which I have the honour to introduce today \r\nunder sub-item (a) of agenda item 34, entitled “Prevention \r\nof armed conflict”, focuses on a pressing legal and \r\npolitical issue — the problem of the militarization of \r\nthe occupied territory of Ukraine, in particular the \r\nCrimean peninsula and respective parts of the Black \r\nSea and the Sea of Azov. The draft resolution addresses \r\na matter of fundamental concern to my country and, I \r\nbelieve, the broader United Nations membership.\r\nThe Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the \r\ncity of Sevastopol have been occupied by the Russian \r\nFederation since February 2014. The attempt to annex \r\nthat sovereign Ukrainian territory was not recognized \r\nby the international community, which was confirmed \r\nby resolution 68/262, on the territorial integrity of \r\nUkraine. Following the Russian Federation’s occupation \r\nof Crimea, it has progressively militarized the Crimean \r\npeninsula, which includes in particular destabilizing \r\ntransfers by Russia of weapon systems, including \r\nnuclear-capable aircraft and missiles, weapons, \r\nammunition and military personnel to the territory \r\nof Ukraine.\r\nThe occupation and subsequent militarization of \r\nCrimea led to the expansion of the area of use of Russian \r\nwarships and military aircraft in the Black Sea region \r\nand far beyond in the entire Mediterranean basin. As \r\nsuch, that activity has far-reaching consequences for \r\nsecurity in not only the Black Sea region, but also the \r\nwhole of Southern Europe, as well as North Africa and \r\nthe Middle East.\r\nMultiple military exercises conducted by Russian \r\narmed forces in Crimea and in the area reflect Russia’s \r\naggressive policy towards Ukraine and other Black Sea \r\nlittoral States. Such exercises also entail considerable \r\nlong-term negative environmental consequences in \r\nthe region.\r\nThe Russian Federation is also actively militarizing \r\nthe Sea of Azov by increasing the number of warships \r\nand their expansion to the whole territory of the Sea. \r\nAs an example, in October the Russian Government \r\nallocated a huge designated area in the Sea of Azov \r\nto the Russian Defence Ministry. That area is located \r\njust 65 kilometres from the city of Mariupol, one of \r\nUkraine’s largest seaport cities.\r\nThe progressing militarization of the Sea of Azov \r\nnot only has implications for maritime trade and \r\nsupplies into Ukraine, but also poses an additional \r\nmilitary threat to Ukraine and is leading to an escalation \r\nof the security situation in the region. The illegal \r\nconstruction of the Kerch Strait bridge between Russia \r\nand temporarily occupied Crimea has substantially \r\ncontributed to that threat, in particular by facilitating \r\nfurther militarization of Crimea and the involvement \r\nof additional Russian maritime and other forces in the \r\narea under the pretext of protecting the bridge and \r\nits infrastructure.\r\nAs a result, on 25 November a group of Ukrainian \r\nnaval vessels was deliberately attacked by the Russian \r\nborder guard patrol in the Black Sea near the Kerch \r\nStrait. Russia adopted a shoot-to-kill policy by openly \r\nfiring at the Ukrainian servicemen and then ramming \r\nthe Ukrainian vessels, which were in the process \r\nof conducting legitimate and peaceful transits to a \r\nUkrainian port.\r\nThat attack represents yet another blatant and \r\nbarefaced act of military aggression against Ukraine \r\nby the Russian Federation. Three Ukrainian military \r\nvessels were shot at and then seized by the Russians in \r\nthe waters beyond the 12-mile zone in the Black Sea on \r\ntheir way back to Odessa port. Twenty-four Ukrainian \r\nservicemen were seized and imprisoned, with six \r\nwounded, including two in critical condition, and \r\nparaded on Russian television as part of a show trial. \r\nThe provocative actions of the Russian Federation in \r\nthe Sea of Azov were condemned by Security Council \r\nmember States during the briefing requested by the \r\ndelegation of Ukraine on 26 November (see S/PV.8410). \r\nThe Secretary-General, in turn, also sounded an alarm.\r\nGiven the current volatile security situation in \r\nthe mentioned areas and its far-reaching negative \r\nimplications, Ukraine, together with Australia, Austria, \r\nBulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, \r\nA/73/PV.56 17/12/2018\r\n12/26 18-44309\r\nDenmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, \r\nIceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMontenegro, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden, \r\nTurkey, the United Kingdom and the United States \r\nof America, submitted draft resolution A/73/L.47, \r\n“Problem of the militarization of the Autonomous \r\nRepublic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, \r\nas well as parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov”. \r\nThat group was later joined by Belgium, Greece, \r\nHungary, Liechtenstein, the former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia, Malta, New Zealand, Slovakia and \r\nSpain. We are very grateful for that strong solidarity \r\nand support.\r\nThe main goal of the draft resolution I am \r\nintroducing today is to urge the Russian Federation \r\nto withdraw its military forces from Crimea and to \r\nstop the illegal occupation of Ukraine’s territory. By \r\nbringing before the General Assembly the issue of \r\nthe militarization of Crimea, Ukraine and the other \r\nco-sponsors do not seek confrontation or politicization. \r\nRather, we believe that it is a matter of the utmost \r\nimportance for every Member State to fully support the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nI believe that the draft resolution will enjoy the \r\nsame support and constructive attitude on the part of \r\nMember States that has been displayed concerning other \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on Ukraine. I urge all \r\nMember States to vote in favour of the draft resolution. \r\nSuch a vote will demonstrate their strong commitment \r\nto the fundamental principles of international law and \r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nUkraine is also convinced that the progressive \r\nmilitarization of the temporarily occupied Autonomous \r\nRepublic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol in Ukraine \r\nby the Russian Federation and Russia’s continued \r\naggressive acts, threats and use of force against Ukraine, \r\nin violation of the United Nations Charter, will have \r\nfar-reaching consequences for international peace and \r\nsecurity. The issue therefore constitutes an important \r\nquestion, as envisaged in rules 83 and 84 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly. Thus, the decisions \r\non the draft resolution and draft amendment A/73/L.68 \r\nshall be made by a two-thirds majority of the members \r\npresent and voting.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nthe representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to \r\nintroduce draft amendment A/73/L.68.\r\nMr. Mamdouhi (Islamic Republic of Iran): On \r\nbehalf of the delegations of the Islamic Republic of Iran, \r\nthe Republic of Nicaragua, the Syrian Arab Republic \r\nand the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, I have the \r\nhonour to introduce draft amendment A/73/L.68 to \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.47. The draft amendment was \r\nsubmitted on 13 December.\r\nBut before introducing the draft amendment, we \r\ndeem it necessary to reiterate our principled position on \r\nRussian and Ukrainian disputes. We firmly believe that \r\ndebates on multifaceted issues of a highly political and \r\ncontroversial nature within the setting of the General \r\nAssembly will have little, if any, utility in furthering \r\nefforts to achieve a workable solution to an issue on \r\nwhich agreements were decided in Minsk in 2015, \r\nendorsed by Security Council resolution 2202 (2015). \r\nWhile there is an agreed international mechanism in \r\nplace, which is supported by the Security Council, \r\nreferring the dispute to the General Assembly could \r\nbring out existing differences and sow division among \r\nMember States, instead of achieving a resolution. \r\nSuch action could even undermine the internationally \r\nrecognized agreed settlement format on Ukraine.\r\nWe need to give the already agreed mechanism \r\nmore time and refrain from taking hasty decisions. Our \r\nprincipled position is to support a peaceful solution to \r\nthe Ukraine and Russia dispute, and we firmly believe \r\nthat the issue must be resolved by the States concerned. \r\nAny solutions outside of that framework will not work \r\nunless endorsed by both Russians and Ukrainians. A \r\nprestigious representative organ should not prematurely \r\nengage itself in a debate that has been on the Security \r\nCouncil agenda since the occurrence of the events that \r\nprompted it.\r\nAs for our draft amendment, I should point out \r\nthat it contains three new operative paragraphs, to be \r\nincorporated after the current paragraph 5 of the draft \r\nresolution. Furthermore, it proposes that a new phrase \r\nbe added to the end of the current paragraph 6. After \r\nthe inclusion of the proposed new paragraphs, the \r\nparagraphs of the draft resolution, from paragraph 5 \r\nonwards, shall therefore be renumbered accordingly.\r\nRegarding the substance of the draft amendment, \r\naccording to the proposed new paragraphs, both Russia \r\nand Ukraine are urged to conduct a full, transparent and \r\nevidence-based investigation of the incident in question, \r\nwith a view to holding accountable those responsible for \r\nthe aggravation of the situation. The draft amendment \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.56\r\n18-44309 13/26\r\nalso stresses that the incident and subsequent measures \r\ntaken should not affect the implementation of the \r\nbinding decision adopted within the United Nations, \r\nnamely, Security Council resolution 2202 (2015), of \r\n17 February, on the issue. In addition to endorsing \r\nthe package of measures for the implementation of \r\nthe Minsk agreements and welcoming the declaration \r\nby the Presidents of Russia, Ukraine and France and \r\nthe German Chancellor in support of the package, the \r\nresolution calls on all parties to fully implement the \r\nmeasures.\r\nMoreover, the draft amendment proposes that \r\na reference to the 2003 treaty between Russia and \r\nUkraine on cooperation in the use of the Sea of Azov \r\nand the Kerch Strait be added at the end of current \r\nparagraph 6, as we believe that the treaty should be \r\nseen as the relevant legal instrument in force between \r\nthe parties concerned in the exercise of navigational \r\nrights and freedoms.\r\nThe proposals put forward are in line with the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, especially as they call on the parties to \r\nexercise restraint, respect each other’s sovereignty \r\nand the inviolability of borders and refrain from \r\ninflammatory rhetoric, which, in our view, is key \r\nto de-escalating tension. The proposals intend to \r\ncontribute to restraining both parties and call on them \r\nto avoid any further escalation of the situation, which is \r\nin line with encouraging the parties concerned to find \r\na peaceful solution to the dispute, as called for by the \r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nFurthermore, the proposals in the draft amendment \r\nhave been taken from agreed texts, some of which were \r\nadopted by the Assembly in its resolution 68/262, of \r\n27 March 2014, on the subject. In paragraph 3, it urges \r\nall parties to immediately pursue the peaceful resolution \r\nof the situation with respect to Ukraine through direct \r\npolitical dialogue and by exercising restraint, refraining \r\nfrom unilateral actions and inflammatory rhetoric \r\nthat may increase tensions and fully engaging with \r\ninternational mediation efforts.\r\nIt was the original intention of our delegations to \r\nsubmit those proposals during the informal consultations \r\non the draft resolution. However, as no consultations \r\nwere convened, we have no other option but to present \r\nthe proposals in the form of a draft amendment.\r\nLast, but not least, the proposals are of a general \r\nnature and fully respect the sovereignty of both Russia \r\nand Ukraine. As a result, they do not take sides with \r\neither of the parties concerned. We invite all Member \r\nStates to support the inclusion of the proposals in \r\nthe draft resolution and to vote in favour of the \r\ndraft amendment.\r\nThe Acting President: We shall now proceed to \r\nconsider draft resolution A/73/L.47.\r\nThe representative of Ukraine has stated that, in \r\nhis view, a two-thirds majority of the members present \r\nand voting is required for the adoption of the draft \r\nresolution and draft amendment A/73/L.68.\r\nAs I see no objection, may I therefore take it that \r\na two-thirds majority of the members present and \r\nvoting is required for the adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.47 and draft amendment A/73/L.68?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor to \r\ndelegations in explanation of vote before the voting, \r\nmay I remind delegations that explanations of vote are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations \r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMr. Al Arsan (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My country’s delegation would like to express \r\nits position on draft resolution A/73/L.47.\r\nWe are concerned about the practice of certain \r\ndelegations of using sub-item (a) of agenda item 34, \r\nentitled “Prevention of armed conflict”, as a tool to \r\nput forward politicized and non-consensual draft \r\nresolutions. That practice by the authors of such draft \r\nresolutions is based on exclusion, singularity and \r\noverlooking the established working mechanisms of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which call for holding consultations, \r\ntaking into account the concerns and positions of States \r\nand providing ample time for arriving at consensual \r\ndraft resolutions.\r\nIn principle, the Syrian Arab Republic opposes \r\nGeneral Assembly draft resolutions whose main \r\nobjective is to apply political pressure and worsen \r\ndisagreements among Member States uselessly, \r\nwhile even overburdening the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly and depleting the energies and human as \r\nwell as financial resources of the United Nations in a \r\nway that undermines the fundamental purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter.\r\nA draft resolution such as the one contained in \r\ndocument A/73/L.47 becomes, regrettably, a means \r\nA/73/PV.56 17/12/2018\r\n14/26 18-44309\r\nfor political politicization, discord and dispute, \r\nrather than bringing us together to achieve peace, \r\nsecurity and development for all, without exception \r\nor discrimination. The legal interpretation and political \r\nposition of the Syrian Arab Republic regarding the \r\nsituation in the Republic of Crimea is based on the \r\nfact that the results of the referendum that took place \r\non 16 March 2014 are ref lected by the current stable \r\nsituation in the region.\r\nWe reaffirm that the draft resolution before us \r\nnow is politicized and unbalanced, in particular its \r\nparagraphs 6 and 7, which we consider an unsuccessful \r\nattempt by the authors to impose biased views that do \r\nnot serve the cause of stability in the region. Those \r\nparagraphs allow certain Governments to exploit the \r\ncurrent situation between two historic neighbours, the \r\nRussian Federation and Ukraine, in order to impose \r\npolitical pressure on Moscow.\r\nHowever, despite our principled position in \r\nopposing such draft resolutions, we, alongside the \r\ndelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran, have \r\nsubmitted amendments contained in document \r\nA/73/L.68. That is a sincere and positive attempt on \r\nour part to contribute some form of balance, credibility \r\nand realism to the draft resolution.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation calls on Member \r\nStates to vote in favour of the amendments to which \r\nI referred. If those amendments are not adopted, \r\nthen we call on Member States to vote against draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.47. Our position today in opposing \r\nthe politicization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nis based on our respect for the Charter and international \r\ntreaties that govern the situation in the Republic \r\nof Crimea. It is also based on our commitment to \r\nthe rules of procedure and to avoiding the General \r\nAssembly from dealing with such politicized issues \r\nand overburdening its agenda with non-consensual \r\ndraft resolutions, particularly when they do not lead to \r\nthe settlement of disputes at the international level and \r\ndo not contribute to international peace and security in \r\nthat region or the world at large.\r\nMr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We very much appreciate the efforts of some \r\nof our colleagues from various Member States to bring \r\na little balance to Ukraine’s hateful draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.47. We understand their desire to introduce \r\nsome objectivity into even one element of this draft \r\ntext on the incident in the Kerch Strait on 25 November.\r\nI believe that many here today have realized the \r\ntrue goals of this overt act of provocation by Kyiv \r\naimed at achieving two main objectives, the first of \r\nwhich is arresting the free fall in the ratings of the \r\ncurrent post-Maidan authorities, above all President \r\nPoroshenko, who is running for re-election for a second \r\nterm, and the second, in violation of the General \r\nAssembly’s established working norms, adopting an \r\nopenly politicized anti-Russian resolution. Today we \r\nare seeing the apogee of those efforts, which were \r\ngiven a green light by various Western countries in \r\nthe Security Council’s meeting on 26 November (see \r\nS/PV.8410).\r\nI would like to remind the Assembly that on the \r\nevening of 25 November, three Ukrainian military \r\nvessels violated the rules of peaceful passage through \r\nRussia’s territorial waters in the Black Sea, in an area \r\nthat was Russian before 2014, and set a course for \r\nthe Kerch Strait. They did not respond to the border \r\nguards’ legitimate demands and carried out dangerous \r\nmanoeuvres that threatened normal navigation. Just \r\nfor information, there were 166 civilian vessels in the \r\nadjacent area at the time.\r\nThe Ukrainian vessels’ violation of Russia’s \r\nsovereignty left the Russian border guards with no \r\nchoice but to use force. Any country’s border control \r\npersonnel would have done the same in the situation. \r\nHowever, thanks to the high level of professionalism \r\nshown by our guys, we managed to avoid any casualties. \r\nThree of the Ukrainian servicemen were slightly \r\ninjured by fragments of ship equipment and were given \r\nmedical assistance, with no threat to their lives. All 24 \r\nmembers of the crew were arrested and given access to \r\nUkrainian consuls, while the impounded ships are in \r\nthe port of Kerch. Criminal proceedings are under way \r\nand the investigation is ongoing. We intend to affirm \r\nthe provocative nature of the Ukrainian authorities’ \r\nactions with documentary proof in court. The actions of \r\nUkraine in the Black Sea are in themselves a violation \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and the standards \r\nof international law, including the 1982 United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, whose articles 19 \r\nand 21 fully define the rules of peaceful passage and \r\ncoastal States’ rights to ensure their security.\r\nIf anyone is still unclear about this after these \r\nclarifications, I would like to add the following. The \r\nincident on 25 November was not accidental. Ukrainian \r\nmilitary vessels intentionally entered the Kerch Strait \r\nfrom Russia’s territorial waters. I want to emphasize \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.56\r\n18-44309 15/26\r\nonce again that those waters were Russian even before \r\nCrimea’s reunification in March 2014. On board those \r\nvessels were two Ukrainian security officers, who \r\nidentified themselves as such. It seems that from the \r\nvery beginning Kyiv planned to sacrifice the crews \r\nof the three ships, tasking them with opening fire on \r\nthe Russian border guards. However, common sense \r\nfortunately stopped them carrying out that criminal act.\r\nIn an attempt to cover its tracks, Ukraine’s Ministry \r\nof Defence concealed material information on the events \r\nof 25 November in the Kerch Strait, which Assembly \r\nmembers may verify for themselves. Kyiv was well \r\naware of the rules for the passage of ships through the \r\nKerch Strait and complied with them from 2014 until \r\nrecently. Indeed, on 23 September two Ukrainian ships \r\nfreely passed under the Crimean bridge with the help of \r\nRussian pilot vessels.\r\nIncidentally, the Ukrainian delegation has \r\ncontinued to mislead everyone regarding the United \r\nNations assessment of what occurred, including during \r\ntheir submission of their draft resolution. I would like \r\nto quote the words of Ms. DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Political Affairs, in the meeting on \r\n26 November:\r\n“Regrettably, a serious security incident took place \r\nyesterday near Crimea, close to the Sea of Azov. I \r\nwish to underline that the United Nations currently \r\ncannot independently verify the circumstances \r\nsurrounding the incident.” (S/PV.8410, p. 2)\r\nThere is therefore no clear assessment from the \r\nUnited Nations of the incident, and there cannot be \r\none. In other words, we are dealing with carefully \r\nplanned and ongoing act of provocation that is still \r\ngoing on under our noses in this Hall. It was made \r\npossible thanks to the approval of the United States and \r\na number of European Union countries that are playing \r\na confrontational game with the Kyiv authorities, and \r\nwe can see that most of those countries have sponsored \r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nI would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to \r\nthe fact that rumours began to be spread about the \r\nsituation in the Sea of Azov several months ago. Our \r\nassurances that we are not planning to create military \r\nbases or military infrastructure in the area were \r\nnot taken into account. The forces we have there are \r\nessential to navigation safety and the protection of the \r\nCrimean bridge. Our random checks of vessels are also \r\ncarried out in strict legality, and all these measures for \r\nprotecting critical infrastructure are extremely urgent \r\ngiven the regular calls from Kyiv and across the ocean \r\nfor blowing up the bridge.\r\nAs long as we are talking about militarization, we \r\nshould be looking at Ukraine, which has declared its \r\nintention to establish a military naval base in Berdyansk \r\nand has been systematically closing various areas of \r\nthe Sea of Azov for firing artillery, and yet the draft \r\nresolution says nothing about that.\r\nI have no desire even to comment on the Ukrainian \r\ndraft resolution. It not only has nothing to do with \r\nreality, it also contains outright lies and disinformation. \r\nIt is clearly one-sided and provocative. Its purpose, like \r\nothers that the Ukrainian delegation has previously \r\nsubmitted and will undoubtedly do again in the future, \r\nis not to solve problems but to polarize Member States, \r\ndivide the General Assembly and give Kyiv’s foreign \r\nmasters a further opportunity to count heads and ensure \r\nthat the number of countries supporting Ukraine’s \r\ndestructive policy in the region has not diminished.\r\nThis is not the first time that the General \r\nAssembly has allowed itself to be dragged into internal \r\npolitical games contrived in Kyiv, Washington and \r\nBrussels, and it is extremely dangerous. That is how \r\nto undermine the authority of our most representative \r\ninternational platform.\r\nUnfortunately, nothing about the attitude or working \r\nmethods of the authors of the draft resolution can be \r\nsaid to be constructive. They did not trouble to hold \r\neven one round of consultations to ascertain Member \r\nStates’ views of this initiative. If such consultations had \r\ntaken place, many inconvenient questions would have \r\nbeen raised. For example, why is there no reference \r\nin the document to the 2003 bilateral treaty between \r\nRussia and Ukraine on cooperation in the use of the Sea \r\nof Azov and the Kerch Strait, which the authors of the \r\ndraft amendments before us have inserted? After all, \r\nit is what regulates passage through the Kerch Strait. I \r\nwill explain why. It is because that document proves tha \r\nRussia’s actions during the incident on 25 November \r\nwere completely legitimate.\r\nWe intend to vote in favour of the aforementioned \r\nreasonable amendments (A/73/L.68) to the Ukrainian \r\ndraft resolution, which call on both parties to exercise \r\nrestraint and refrain from inflammatory rhetoric. It \r\nwould be odd if we did not to support that conciliatory \r\nmessage. Unfortunately, however, no amendments \r\ncan change the provocative essence of Ukraine’s draft \r\nA/73/PV.56 17/12/2018\r\n16/26 18-44309\r\nresolution. My delegation will therefore vote against it, \r\nand we urge all sensible delegations to do the same.\r\nWe urge those who intend to support the Ukraine’s \r\nprovocative action despite everything to think about \r\nthe message that they are sending to Kyiv. By voting \r\nfor these kinds of draft resolutions, in practice they \r\nare enabling Petro Poroshenko to continue destroying \r\nhis own citizens, undermining peace in the region and \r\ndragging his neighbours into confrontations. That is \r\nhardly consistent with the purposes and principles of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMrs. Van Eerten (Netherlands): The Kingdom \r\nof the Netherlands will vote against draft amendment \r\nA/73/L.68, which is not in line with the core message \r\nof draft resolution A/73/L.47 and contradicts the facts \r\non the ground.\r\nLet us be clear that the root cause of the current \r\ntension in the region was the illegal annexation of the \r\nCrimean peninsula by the Russian Federation. In its \r\noriginal form, the draft resolution once again calls on \r\nthe Russian Federation to end its illegal annexation \r\nof the Crimean peninsula, to restore the territorial \r\nintegrity of Ukraine within its internationally \r\nrecognized borders and to respect the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. The Kingdom of the Netherlands \r\ntherefore asks the representatives in this Hall to vote \r\nagainst the draft amendment.\r\nMs. Schoulgin Nyoni (Sweden): As one of the many \r\nco-sponsors of draft resolution A/73/L.47, Sweden has \r\nclosely followed the drafting of the text. We also follow \r\nthe situation on the ground in the region with great \r\nconcern, as it is playing out in our own neighbourhood. \r\nIt is clear that the illegal annexation of Crimea by the \r\nRussian Federation in 2014 was a f lagrant breach of \r\ninternational law and that the progressive militarization \r\nof Crimea and parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov \r\nare of the utmost concern, with dangerous regional and \r\nglobal implications.\r\nWe consider the proposed draft amendment \r\nA/73/L.68 as an attempt to distort the core message of \r\nthe draft resolution and we believe that it contradicts \r\nthe facts on the ground. Sweden will therefore vote \r\nagainst the proposed draft amendment and respectfully \r\nasks the representatives present to do the same.\r\nMr. Radomski (Poland): Let me thank Minister \r\nKyslytsya for his introduction of draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.47. We call on all States to reject draft amendment \r\nA/73/L.68, presented by the Islamic Republic of Iran, \r\nand to support the draft resolution, entitled “Problem \r\nof the militarization of the Autonomous Republic of \r\nCrimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, as well \r\nas parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov”, which \r\nreflects the serious situation on the ground correctly \r\nand in a balanced manner.\r\nRussia’s provocative actions in the Kerch Strait \r\nand the Sea of Azov resulted in a dangerous escalation \r\nof tension. The recent incidents are in keeping with \r\nRussia’s persistent policy towards Ukraine — creating \r\naggression to destabilize the country. Poland underlines \r\nthat the illegal use of military force by the Russian \r\nFederation against Ukraine in the region of the Kerch \r\nStrait and the Sea of Azov constitutes a f lagrant \r\nviolation of both international law and the bilateral \r\nagreements concluded between Russia and Ukraine.\r\nThrough its illegal annexation of Crimea and by \r\ndirectly assisting separatists in eastern Ukraine, Russia \r\nviolated the basic premises of a rules-based international \r\norder. Russia’s recent actions against Ukraine are \r\nclearly part of its ongoing breaches of the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law. No country has the legal \r\nright to benefit from its own illegal actions. We believe \r\nthat the international community must rigorously react \r\nin the face of Russia’s systematic violations of its own \r\nobligations under international law. Our common \r\nresponse must be strong enough to discourage Russia \r\nfrom crossing other red lines. We cannot forget that, \r\nunder international law, all States have a duty not to \r\nrecognize as lawful serious breaches of obligations \r\narising under peremptory norms, such as the prohibition \r\nof aggression. It is important to emphasize the legal \r\ncharacter of that obligation. Not to recognize such \r\nactions as lawful is not a matter of taking a political \r\ndecision or approach; it is a legal requirement.\r\nRecognition of Crimea as part of the Russian \r\nFederation is in itself a violation of international law \r\nbecause it constitutes a form of support for a State that \r\nbreaches peremptory norms in an attempt to legalize an \r\nunlawful situation. Poland therefore does not, and will \r\nnever, recognize Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea \r\nand reaffirms its enduring support for the territorial \r\nintegrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. \r\nFurthermore, Poland calls for the unconditional release \r\nof the vessels, crew and equipment without delay, since \r\nRussia’s attack on and seizure of the Ukrainian vessels, \r\nas well as its capture of Ukrainian servicemen, were \r\nillegal. Recent developments have clearly demonstrated \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.56\r\n18-44309 17/26\r\nthat the infrastructure that Russia treats as critical, be \r\nit the Kerch Bridge or the pipeline, serve as a pretext \r\nfor its illegal militarization. That is a worrying sign \r\nfor the future and undermines regional stability and \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMs. Plepytė (Lithuania): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of Estonia, Latvia and my own \r\ncountry, Lithuania. As co-sponsors of draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.47, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania strongly reject \r\nand oppose the amendments to the draft resolution put \r\nforward by the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Syrian \r\nArab Republic, contained in document A/73/L.68.\r\nThe proposed draft amendment contains hostile \r\namendments that have the sole intention of disrupting \r\nthe adoption of the draft resolution and changing its \r\nmeaning. The amendments distort the current reality \r\nin the occupied territories of Ukraine, as well as in the \r\nadjacent areas of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. \r\nThe amendments do not have any legal or factual \r\nbackground. The events that took place in the Black \r\nSea on 25 November constitute a blatant violation \r\nof international law and bilateral agreements by the \r\nRussian Federation. Russia once again showed complete \r\ndisregard for the norms of international law and, for \r\nthe first time since the annexation of Crimea and the \r\ninstigation of conflict in eastern Ukraine, openly and \r\ndirectly attacked the Ukrainian navy with military \r\nforce. In that context, we once again express our strong \r\nsupport for the draft resolution, as it fully reflects the \r\nreal situation on the ground and calls for appropriate \r\nand realistic action. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will \r\nvote against the draft amendment. Accordingly, we \r\nurge all Member States to reject the blatant attempt \r\nto distort the draft resolution and to vote against the \r\ndraft amendment.\r\nMr. Allen (United Kingdom): I am taking the \r\nf loor to urge all Member States to vote against draft \r\namendment A/73/L.68. The amendments that it contains \r\nhave been proposed by representatives of a tiny group \r\nof countries that have supported Russia’s actions in \r\nthe face of resolution 68/262, which was adopted with \r\n100 votes in favour and upholds the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of Ukraine.\r\nThe amendments seek to distort the facts, sow \r\nconfusion and frustrate the adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.47, proposed by Ukraine, on which we will \r\nvote shortly. Above all, in paragraph 6 of the draft \r\namendment, the text creates the misleading impression \r\nthat territorial waters were violated during the incident. \r\nWe must be clear — there was no such violation. The \r\nRussian authorities have admitted using force to \r\nseize the three Ukrainian naval vessels. They have \r\nalso acknowledged opening fire during the incident, \r\ninjuring three servicemen. That incident happened in \r\ninternational waters in the Black Sea when Ukrainian \r\nvessels were moving away from the Crimean coast. It is \r\nimportant to note that Crimea and its territorial waters \r\nare internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.\r\nI listened with interest to the Russian \r\nrepresentative’s comments, but no evidence has been \r\noffered by Russia to back up its claims. In paragraph \r\n7 of the draft amendment, the text, if inserted into \r\nthe draft resolution, would seek to justify Russia’s \r\narrest and prosecution of the 24 detained Ukrainian \r\nservicemen. That language would provide Russia with \r\ninsurance that its actions are in line with a United \r\nNations resolution and therefore justifiable. The draft \r\namendment risks being misused by Russia.\r\nHowever reasonable the sponsors may sound, their \r\naims are unreasonable. It is for those reasons that the \r\nUnited Kingdom will vote against the draft amendment \r\nand urges others to do the same. The essence of the \r\nissue is our common belief that States must not use force \r\nin their international relations, including to acquire \r\nterritory or to change borders, which is inconsistent \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Kyslytsya (Ukraine): One of the most toxic \r\nfeatures of this discussion is that a small number \r\nof countries that cannot help lapsing into repetitive \r\nviolations of international law and the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations have given us an earful of post-truths, \r\nmanipulative statements, distortions and blatant lies. I \r\nwould therefore like to bring our discussions back to \r\nthe legal realm. Draft amendment A/73/L.68, proposed \r\nby Iran, contains amendments to draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.47 that are not acceptable to its sponsors, as we \r\nhave just heard, on the following grounds.\r\nThe proposed amendments do not have any legal \r\nor factual background and do not meet the provisions \r\nof current General Assembly resolutions, notably \r\nresolution 68/262, “Territorial integrity of Ukraine”, \r\nadopted on 27 March 2014 by an overwhelming \r\nmajority under the same agenda item. What happened \r\non 25 November in the Black Sea is not an incident, as \r\nthe Russian propaganda machine consistently states. It \r\nis yet another violation by the Russian Federation of the \r\nA/73/PV.56 17/12/2018\r\n18/26 18-44309\r\nUnited Nations Charter and a deliberate armed attack \r\nby Russian military forces against Ukraine within the \r\nneutral borders of the Black Sea. The Russian Federation \r\nbrutally violated Ukraine’s right as a coastal State in \r\nUkraine’s territorial waters, intervened in its freedom \r\nof navigation in an international strait and violated \r\nUkraine’s rights in that exclusive economic zone.\r\nAs a result, Ukrainian sailors and vessels were \r\ncaptured by the Russian Federation. In violation of the \r\nGeneva Conventions, Russia is treating the captured \r\ncrew members as criminals and is conducting a so-\r\ncalled criminal investigation, as we have just heard. \r\nHow can the General Assembly be expected to support \r\na draft amendment that does not meet the requirements \r\nof international humanitarian law? That is nonsense in \r\na civilized world. Ukraine has already initiated arbitral \r\nproceedings against the Russian Federation with regard \r\nto violations of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea. Ukraine also informed the arbitral \r\ntribunal of Russia’s recent violations of 25 November, \r\nwhich aggravated the dispute.\r\nUkraine is committed to solving all disputes by \r\npeaceful means, in accordance with the United Nations \r\nCharter. Having said that, my delegation calls for a \r\nrecorded vote on draft amendment A/73/L.68, which \r\nUkraine will vote against, and asks other delegations \r\nto do the same. I also once again call on delegations to \r\nvote in favour of draft resolution A/73/L.47.\r\nMr. Simonoff (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States will vote against draft amendment \r\nA/73/L.68 and urges all delegations to do the same. We \r\nreject the notion of equivalency contained in the draft \r\namendment. We do not support the General Assembly \r\ncalling on both States to take action when the Russian \r\nFederation is the sole Member State to have repeatedly \r\nand shamelessly engaged in aggressive activities \r\ndirected against Ukraine, including the purported \r\nannexation of Crimea and the aggressive activities in \r\nthe Kerch Strait.\r\nThe United States is pleased to co-sponsor draft \r\nresolution A/73/L.47, which highlights serious concerns \r\nabout the militarization of Crimea and Russia’s recent \r\nunprovoked attack on Ukrainian naval vessels in the \r\nKerch Strait. Russia’s attack is a dangerous escalation \r\nin its ongoing aggressive activities towards Ukraine. \r\nThe United States reiterates its call on the Russian \r\nFederation to immediately release the 24 captured \r\nUkrainian crew members and the three detained vessels.\r\nIn short, the United States calls on all Member \r\nStates to vote against the draft amendment and to vote \r\nin favour of the draft resolution.\r\nMs. Agladze (Georgia): I would also like to speak \r\nagainst draft amendment A/73/L.68, proposed by \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran. The draft amendment \r\nsubstantially harms the very essence of draft resolution \r\nA/73/L.47 and gravely distorts the real situation on \r\nthe ground in the occupied territories of Ukraine, as \r\nwell as in the adjacent areas of the Black Sea and the \r\nSea of Azov. It lacks any legal or factual background \r\nand contravenes the provisions of current resolutions, \r\nincluding resolution 68/262 on the territorial integrity \r\nof Ukraine.\r\nOn 25 November we witnessed a violation by \r\nthe Russian Federation of the Charter of the United \r\nNations in a deliberate armed attack by the Russian \r\narmed forces against Ukraine in the neutral waters \r\nof the Black Sea. The Russian Federation brutally \r\nviolated Ukraine’s right as a coastal State in Ukraine’s \r\nterritorial waters, infringed upon the freedom of \r\nnavigation and violated Ukraine’s right in its exclusive \r\neconomic zone. Furthermore, the Russian Federation \r\ncaptured Ukrainian sailors and vessels and treated the \r\ncrew members as criminals.\r\nHaving said all that and in reaffirmation of the \r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, \r\nGeorgia will vote against the draft amendment and \r\ncalls on other Member States to also vote against it.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the voting.\r\nThe General Assembly will now take action on \r\ndraft resolution A/73/L.47, entitled “Problem of the \r\nmilitarization of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea \r\nand the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, as well as parts of \r\nthe Black Sea and the Sea of Azov”.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat since the submission of the draft resolution and in \r\naddition to those delegations listed on the document, \r\nthe following countries have also become sponsors of \r\nA/73/L.47: Belgium, Greece, Hungary, Liechtenstein, \r\nMalta, New Zealand, Slovakia, Spain and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.56\r\n18-44309 19/26\r\nThe Acting President: In connection with the draft \r\nresolution, the General Assembly has before it draft \r\namendment A/73/L.68. In accordance with rule 90 of \r\nthe rules of procedure, the Assembly shall first take a \r\ndecision on the draft amendment.

72 abstentions (resolution 73/194).\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor \r\nfor explanations of vote on the resolution just adopted, \r\nmay I remind delegations that explanations of vote are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations \r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMr. Polyanskiy (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We regret the results of the vote that has \r\njust been held, but we are encouraged by the fact that \r\nmany States abstained and want nothing to do with this \r\npernicious Ukrainian enterprise. However, we have to \r\nconclude that today we have seen the formation of a \r\ngroup of Member States, mainly members of NATO \r\nand the European Union (EU), that through both \r\ntheir action and lack of action have encouraged their \r\nUkrainian protégés to commit new crimes and acts of \r\nprovocation in the region on behalf of Western political \r\nambitions. It is those States, in most cases guided by \r\ntheir infamous bloc discipline, that feature on the list of \r\nauthors and sponsors of Ukraine’s undertaking.\r\nThanks to this, the Kyiv regime continues to get the \r\nmessage that anything is permitted, all will be forgiven \r\nand Russia will be blamed for all its sins and crimes \r\nin advance and without exception. Thus it is Russia, \r\nwithout any evidence, that is accused of being behind \r\nthe five-year fratricidal war in Donbas, despite the fact \r\nthat that the Kyiv regime has presented no evidence \r\nfor the alleged Russian aggression behind which it is \r\nhiding, unless we count the fake stuff that Ukraine’s \r\nPresident periodically likes to beguile the international \r\ncommunity with and that any expert can see is false.\r\nOn the other hand, there is plenty of proof that \r\nUkraine’s armed forces and various volunteer battalions \r\nare waging war on their own citizens, shooting and \r\nkilling women, the elderly and children. That is not \r\nsomething the Assembly wants to see, because it is \r\nnot convenient. It is members’ successors who will \r\nultimately make judge the situation fairly, ashamed of \r\nthe hypocrisy and this unprincipled position, just as \r\nordinary Americans today are ashamed of America’s \r\ndishonourable campaign in Viet Nam. Unfortunately, \r\nthere are many current situations of which future \r\nUnited States citizens will be ashamed, with Ukraine \r\nbeing one of the most vivid examples.\r\nInstead of the United States bringing the Maidan \r\nregime to its senses and making it listen to the voice \r\nof its people, it is supplying it with weapons and all \r\nkinds of support, including military support. Such \r\naction suggests that Washington is not just trying to pit \r\ntwo brother peoples against each other but to unleash \r\na full-scale war between them, while brainwashing its \r\nNATO colleagues about the alleged Russian threat. \r\nIncidentally, there is only one worldwide threat today, \r\nthe American threat, and that is becoming clearer and \r\nclearer to many people.\r\nOne of the subjects of resolution 73/194 is Russian \r\nCrimea. I want to emphasize that Crimea is Russian \r\nbecause there has been no other Crimea for a long time. \r\nThis annexed, occupied, militarized territory exists only \r\nin the draft resolutions of our Ukrainian colleagues, \r\nwho are apparently still experiencing phantom pains. It \r\nis they themselves who lost Crimea and the Crimeans \r\nwhen they began to threaten them in the wake of the \r\nanti-constitutional coup. The Crimeans made a choice \r\nin order to preserve their identity and be able to honour \r\nthe memory of those who freed their land from the \r\nfascists and refused to collaborate with the occupiers. \r\nThrough their choice, the Crimeans saved themselves \r\nfrom the war and destruction with which citizens of \r\neastern Ukraine just like them are paying a heavy price \r\nfor their attempts to claim those rights.\r\nMany tourists visit Crimea today, including \r\nhundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, who can see with \r\ntheir own eyes that what the Maidan authorities say is \r\nnot true. No matter how many phoney resolutions they \r\nand their Western sponsors and those who are afraid to \r\noppose them in the spirit of EU and NATO democracy, \r\nthat will change nothing in or around Crimea. The key to \r\nsolving all the regional problems that have arisen since \r\n2014 lies in Kyiv, and more specifically in Washington, \r\nfrom whence Kyiv is governed.\r\nIncidentally, we should point out that the Ukrainian \r\ndelegation got entangled in lies even in its statement \r\ntoday. Mr. Kyslytsya stated that the recent incident \r\noccurred in neutral waters, if I correctly understood \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.56\r\n18-44309 21/26\r\nhis English. However, on 11 December right here in \r\nthis Hall, the representative of Ukraine stated that \r\nthe incident in question, which in her view involved \r\nthe capture of Ukrainian ships, occurred in Ukraine’s \r\nexclusive economic zone (see A/73/PV.49). My advice \r\nto Ukraine is that if it is going to lie, it should make \r\nsure that the lies all match. That will improve its \r\nbelievability.\r\nAs far as Russia and the Crimeans are concerned, \r\nthe issue of Crimea’s ownership has been resolved once \r\nand for all. Crimea was, is and will be Russian. None \r\nof Ukraine’s pitiful attempts at sanctions, resolutions or \r\nprovocations will change that. It is very disappointing \r\nthat Kyiv and its Western sponsors in the General \r\nAssembly have submitted yet another highly politicized, \r\nphoney and utterly false concoction. Such behaviour \r\nclearly tarnishes the reputation of the Organization.\r\nMr. Tozik (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): Belarus \r\nhas carefully followed the events in Ukraine and the \r\ndevelopments in the situation in the eastern region \r\nof our neighbour to the south. Peace and harmony in \r\nUkraine are of vital importance to Belarus. A peaceful \r\nsettlement of the conflict, an end to the violence, the \r\nprevention of armed clashes and the compliance of \r\nthe parties to the Minsk agreements remain the only \r\ntrue basis for effectively resolving the crisis. Belarus \r\nintends to continue to provide all assistance necessary \r\nto restore peace in Ukraine and to ensure the conditions \r\nnecessary for holding negotiations in Minsk in any \r\nformat, including at the highest level, as ws done in \r\nFebruary 2015.\r\nToday we supported the submission by a group of \r\nStates of the draft amendments contained in document \r\nA/73/L.68 to resolution 73/194, which are constructive \r\nand balanced and could serve as a comprehensive \r\nreflection of the situation. We did not vote for the \r\nresolution as a whole in view of our consistent position \r\non that kind of document.\r\nFor example, the resolution contains references to \r\nresolutions 68/262, 71/205 and 72/190 to which Belarus \r\nobjected  It makes no reference to the Minsk agreements, \r\nwhich is crucial, it is essentially confrontational \r\nand narrows the possibilities for seeking a peaceful \r\nsolution to the situation. It has no provisions regarding \r\ncontributing to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security or preventing armed conflicts, and it \r\nincludes accusations against one country alone. No \r\nsimilar requirements are made of other States that are \r\nbuilding a military presence in the region.\r\nSuch documents should call for a preliminary \r\nstudy within the framework of existing United Nations \r\nprocedures, including at the expert level, which was \r\nnot done in this case.\r\nMr. Margaryan (Armenia): We are following \r\nwith deep concern the increasing tensions related to \r\nCrimea and the developments in the area of the Black \r\nSea. Armenia shares a rich history of friendship with \r\nthe peoples of Russia and Ukraine. We hope that the \r\nparties concerned will exercise the utmost restraint to \r\nde-escalate the situation in order to open the way for \r\nnegotiations. We are confident that the solution to the \r\ncrisis can be achieved strictly through peaceful means, \r\nbased on the norms and principles of international law.\r\nOn a general note, Armenia reiterates its long-\r\nstanding position that an enduring solution to the conflict \r\nsituation between the parties can be achieved only \r\nthrough negotiations, in the established format and on \r\nthe basis of the implementation of relevant agreements.\r\nMr. Kyslytsya (Ukraine): Since the Russian \r\nrepresentative has problems understanding English, I \r\nwill say a few words in Russian.\r\n(spoke in Russian)\r\nIt seems that everyone in this Hall — the more \r\nthan 40 sponsors and almost 70 countries supporting \r\nresolution 73/194 — should be ashamed. Only the \r\nRussian Federation is not ashamed. Throughout its \r\nalmost 28 years as a member of the Security Council, \r\nthe Russian Federation has violated the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations many times, including its most \r\nfundamental provisions. In politics, and also in \r\npsychology and psychiatry, such behaviour is called \r\naggressive mimicry. In this type of behaviour, the \r\naggressor tries to present itself as the victim and \r\nbehaves as if it were the victim. But in both politics \r\nand psychology there are ways and means to fight that \r\naggressive mimicry.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIt is with great appreciation that we note that \r\nresolution 73/194 on the urgent and pressing issue of \r\narmed aggression by the Russian Federation against \r\nUkraine has been adopted today, with its clear evidence \r\nof total disregard by Russia of its obligations under the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, as well as other bilateral \r\nA/73/PV.56 17/12/2018\r\n22/26 18-44309\r\nand multilateral international treaties. It is evident that \r\nthe Russian Federation is certainly not a peace-loving \r\nState. Today, with the adoption of the resolution on a \r\nsituation that is of genuine concern not only to Ukraine \r\nbut also to the international community as a whole, \r\nwe have passed a critical juncture in condemning the \r\npattern of destructive activity of the Russian Federation \r\nin the region and beyond, thus reaffirming the ability of \r\nthe General Assembly to discharge its responsibilities \r\nin the sphere of the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to express our deepest \r\nand sincerest gratitude to all those who participated \r\nin the negotiation of the draft resolution and all those \r\nwho, under unprecedented pressure by Russia, have \r\nstayed courageous and remained committed to the \r\nfoundations of the Organization. Ukraine is absolutely \r\nconvinced that the issue of international peace and \r\nsecurity represents a core pillar of the Assembly’s \r\nwork. Therefore, my delegation will continue its \r\nefforts to bring to the attention of the United Nations \r\nthe situation in the parts of the sovereign territory of \r\nUkraine that are occupied by the Russian Federation. I \r\ntake this opportunity to also call on all Member States \r\nto actively participate in the Assembly’s consideration \r\nof its newly introduced agenda item 67, “Situation in \r\nthe temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine”, at a \r\nmeeting to be held in February 2019.\r\nMr. Gafoor (Singapore): I am taking the f loor \r\nto explain my delegation’s vote in favour of both the \r\namendment contained in document A/73/L.68 and \r\nresolution 73/194. As a small country, Singapore is \r\ndeeply committed to multilateralism and respect for \r\ninternational law. Singapore opposes the annexation \r\nof any country or territory, as it is a clear violation of \r\ninternational law. We object to any unprovoked invasion \r\nof a sovereign country under any pretext. Singapore \r\nreaffirms the principles of respect for territorial \r\nintegrity, non-interference in the domestic affairs of \r\na sovereign State, respect for sovereignty and the rule \r\nof law. Singapore therefore opposes the annexation \r\nof Crimea.\r\nIn March 2014, Singapore expressed its opposition \r\nto the annexation of Crimea by voting in favour \r\nof resolution 68/262, entitled “Territorial integrity \r\nof Ukraine” (see A/68/PV.80). In our view, the \r\nresolution that we have just adopted (resolution \r\n73/194) is intrinsically linked to resolution 68/262. \r\nUnlike resolutions 71/205 and 72/190 on the human \r\nrights situation in Crimea and Sevastopol, the crux of \r\nresolution 73/194 is related to the question of Ukraine’s \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. Singapore also \r\nreaffirms its consistent view that all countries must \r\nadhere to international law and support the right to the \r\nfreedom of navigation, as provided for by the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Singapore \r\nechoes the call of the Secretary-General to avoid any \r\nrisk of further escalation and we urge all parties to \r\nexercise restraint, take immediate steps to de-escalate \r\ntension and resolve the crisis peacefully, in accordance \r\nwith international law.\r\nMr. Chang (Republic of Korea): My delegation \r\nvoted against the amendment contained in document \r\nA/73/L.68 and abstained in the voting on resolution \r\n73/194.\r\nWhile emphasizing the importance of peaceful \r\nresolution through dialogue, my delegation would \r\nlike to note that today’s vote does not constitute a \r\ndeparture from its position of 27 March 2014, when it \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 68/262 (see A/68/PV.80), \r\nreaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, political \r\nindependence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine \r\nwithin its internationally recognized borders.\r\nMs. Krisnamurthi (Indonesia): Let me start \r\nby reaffirming our basic principle to respect and \r\nsupport the territorial integrity of Ukraine within \r\nits internationally recognized borders. Indonesia’s \r\nprincipled and consistent position respects the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States and is \r\na fundamental principle of relations among nations. \r\nIndonesia is therefore opposed to any action of \r\nannexation against any sovereign country or territory, \r\nas that would contravene the aforementioned principles \r\nas well as international law.\r\nWith regard to the current situation in Crimea, \r\nIndonesia stresses the importance of dialogue and \r\ndiplomacy among concerned States in order to \r\nresolve the ongoing problems in Crimea and the city \r\nof Sevastopol, as well as parts of the Black Sea and \r\nthe Sea of Azov. In so doing, Indonesia encourages the \r\nStates concerned to take the measures necessary to \r\nde-escalate tensions. We are of the view that some of \r\nthe elements of resolution 73/194 may further escalate \r\ntension among the concerned States and further \r\nalienate them from initiating possible peaceful efforts, \r\nincluding through direct political dialogue.\r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.56\r\n18-44309 23/26\r\nBased on those considerations, while in favour \r\nof the amendment contained in document A/73/L.68, \r\nwhich was proposed by several delegations, Indonesia \r\nabstained in the voting on resolution 73/194. Indonesia \r\ncalls on all concerned parties to manage the crisis, \r\npromote the peaceful settlement of the situation and \r\nconsistently uphold and respect international law.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote after the voting.\r\nI now give the f loor to the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union.\r\nMr. Dabouis (European Union): The candidate \r\ncountries Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Montenegro and Albania; the European \r\nFree Trade Association country Liechtenstein, member \r\nof the European Economic Area; as well as Ukraine, \r\nthe Republic of Moldova and Georgia align themselves \r\nwith this statement.\r\nThe European Union (EU) reaffirms its full \r\nsupport for the independence, sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally \r\nrecognized borders. The EU recalls that the illegal \r\nannexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia in 2014 \r\nremains a direct challenge to international security, \r\nwith grave implications for the international legal order \r\nthat protects the unity and sovereignty of all States. The \r\nEU condemns that violation of international law and \r\nunderlines that it does not and will not recognize the \r\nillegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia. \r\nThe EU recalls that the construction of the Kerch bridge \r\nconstitutes a further violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity.\r\nWe refer to the declaration made by High \r\nRepresentative Federica Mogherini on behalf of the \r\nEU on the escalating tensions in the Azov Sea, issued \r\non 28 November, in which the EU expressed its utmost \r\nconcern about the dangerous increase of tensions in the \r\nAzov Sea and the Kerch Strait, which had led to the \r\nseizure of Ukrainian vessels and their crews by Russia, \r\nwith shots being fired at them, wounding several \r\nUkrainian servicemen. We underscore that the EU was \r\ndismayed at that use of force by Russia, which, against \r\nthe backdrop of increasing militarization in the area, \r\nis unacceptable.\r\nThe EU strongly calls on Russia to unconditionally \r\nrelease the seized vessels and their crew and \r\nequipment, without delay. The EU expects Russia to \r\nensure unhindered and free passage through the Kerch \r\nStrait to and from the Azov Sea, in accordance with \r\ninternational law. We also recall the EU call for all \r\nparties to exercise the utmost restraint to de-escalate \r\nthe tension.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nsub-item (a) of agenda item 34.\r\nAgenda item 116 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and \r\nother elections\r\n(b) Election of members of the United Nations \r\nCommission on International Trade Law\r\nThe Acting President: The 30 outgoing Member \r\nStates are as follows: Armenia, Bulgaria, Cameroon, \r\nCanada, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Denmark, Ecuador, \r\nEl Salvador, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, \r\nHungary, Indonesia, Japan, Kuwait, Liberia, Malaysia, \r\nMauritania, Mexico, Namibia, Panama, the Republic of \r\nKorea, the Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, Singapore, \r\nSwitzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland and Zambia. Those Member States \r\nare eligible for immediate re-election.\r\nI should like to inform members that the following \r\nStates will continue to be represented in the Commission \r\non International Trade Law: Argentina, Australia, \r\nAustria, Belarus, Brazil, Burundi, Chile, Colombia, \r\nthe Czech Republic, India, the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Lebanon, Lesotho, Libya, \r\nMauritius, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, \r\nRomania, Spain, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, \r\nthe United States of America and the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela. Those 30 States are therefore \r\nnot eligible for election.\r\nThe General Assembly will now proceed to the \r\nelection of 30 members to replace those members whose \r\nterm of office will expire on 7 July 2019.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, \r\nthe election shall be held by secret ballot. I should like \r\nto recall, however, paragraph 16 of General Assembly \r\ndecision 34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing \r\nwith the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs \r\nwhen the number of candidates corresponds to the \r\nnumber of seats to be filled should become standard \r\nunless delegations specifically request a vote on a \r\ngiven election.\r\nA/73/PV.56 17/12/2018\r\n24/26 18-44309\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it \r\nthat the Assembly decides to proceed to this election \r\non the basis of dispensing with the secret ballot, \r\nwhere applicable?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: With regard to candidatures, \r\nI should like to inform members of the following.\r\nFor the seven seats from among the African States, \r\nthe group has endorsed the following seven candidates: \r\nAlgeria, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, South \r\nAfrica and Zimbabwe.\r\nFor the seven seats from among the Asia-Pacific \r\nStates, nine candidates have been communicated: \r\nBahrain, China, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, Malaysia, the \r\nRepublic of Korea, Singapore and Viet Nam.\r\nFor the four seats from among the Eastern European \r\nStates, the group has endorsed the following four \r\ncandidates: Croatia, Hungary, the Russian Federation \r\nand Ukraine.\r\nFor the five seats from among the Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States, five candidates have been \r\ncommunicated: the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, \r\nHonduras, Mexico and Peru.\r\nFor the seven seats from among the Western \r\nEuropean and other States, eight candidates have been \r\ncommunicated: Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, \r\nGermany, Greece, Switzerland and the United Kingdom \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nSince the number of candidates from the African \r\nStates, the Eastern European States and the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States corresponds to the \r\nnumber of seats to be filled by each group, may I take \r\nit that the General Assembly wishes to declare those \r\ncandidates elected for a six-year term beginning on \r\n8 July 2019?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: With regard to the Asia-\r\nPacific States and the Western European and other \r\nStates, the number of candidates exceeds the number \r\nof vacancies allocated to those regions. Therefore, the \r\nAssembly will now proceed to a vote by secret ballot \r\nto elect seven members from among the Asia-Pacific \r\nStates and seven members from among the Western \r\nEuropean and other States.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that the \r\nnumber of candidates not exceeding the number of \r\nseats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of \r\nvotes and not less than the majority required, will be \r\ndeclared elected.\r\nIn the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there \r\nwill be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates \r\nthat have obtained an equal number of votes. Consistent \r\nwith the practice of the General Assembly, if more than \r\nthe required number of Member States have obtained \r\nthe required majority of the same ballot, those Member \r\nStates that have obtained the largest number of votes \r\nabove the required majority will be considered elected \r\nup to the number of seats to be filled. Moreover, \r\nconsistent with past practice, if, due to a tie vote, it \r\nbecomes necessary to determine one candidate to \r\nbe elected or that will proceed to the next round of \r\nrestricted balloting, there will be a special restricted \r\nballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an \r\nequal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Before we begin the voting \r\nprocess, I should like to remind members that, pursuant \r\nto rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General \r\nAssembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting \r\nexcept on a point of order on the actual conduct of \r\nthe voting. In addition, ballot papers will be given \r\nonly to the representatives seated directly behind the \r\ncountry’s nameplate.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. I would like to remind members that, at \r\nthis stage, they are voting for seven seats for the Asia-\r\nPacific States and seven seats for the Western European \r\nand other States.\r\nBallot papers marked “A” and “B” will now be \r\ndistributed and the voting has thus begun.\r\nIn accordance with resolution 71/323 of \r\n8 September 2017, the names of the States that have \r\nbeen communicated to the Secretariat at least 48 hours \r\nprior to the election today have been printed on the \r\nballot papers for the two regional groups. Moreover, \r\nadditional blank lines corresponding to the number of \r\nvacant seats to be filled for each of the regional groups \r\n17/12/2018 A/73/PV.56\r\n18-44309 25/26\r\nhave been provided on the ballot papers for inscribing \r\nother States as necessary.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot \r\npapers that have been distributed. For ballot papers \r\nmarked “A” for Asia-Pacific States, members are \r\nrequested to put an “X” in the boxes next to the States \r\nthat they wish to vote for and/or write other eligible \r\nnames on the blank lines. For ballot papers marked “B” \r\nfor Western European and other States, members are \r\nalso requested to put an “X” in the boxes next to the \r\nStates on the ballot paper or write the name of another \r\neligible State on the blank line. The total number of \r\nchecked boxes and/or handwritten names should not \r\nexceed the number of vacant seats to be filled, as \r\nindicated on the ballot paper.\r\nA ballot will be declared invalid if it contains \r\nmore names of Member States from the relevant region \r\nthan the number of seats assigned to it. Accordingly, \r\nfor ballot papers marked “A” for Asia-Pacific States, \r\nthe total number of checked boxes and/or handwritten \r\nnames should not exceed seven, and for ballot papers \r\nmarked “B” for Western European and other States, \r\nthe total number of checked boxes and/or handwritten \r\nnames should also not exceed seven. If a ballot paper \r\nfor a region contains the names of States that do not \r\nbelong to the region concerned, the ballot paper \r\nremains valid but the vote for those Member States will \r\nnot be counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the Acting President, \r\nMr. Stankov (Bulgaria), Ms. Edwards (Guyana), \r\nMr. El Jallad (Lebanon), Ms. De Schot (New \r\nZealand), Mrs. Philips-Umezurike (Nigeria) and \r\nMr. Muhamedjanov (Tajikistan) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 5.45 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 6.25 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows:\r\nGroup A — Asia-Pacific States (7 seats)\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  193\r\nAbstentions:  0\r\nNumber of members present and voting:  193\r\nRequired majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nSingapore  180\r\nJapan  167\r\nIndonesia  160\r\nChina  159\r\nViet Nam  157\r\nRepublic of Korea  155\r\nMalaysia  149\r\nBahrain  116\r\nIraq  57\r\nKuwait  1\r\nGroup B — Western European and other States \r\n(7 seats)\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  193\r\nAbstentions:  2\r\nNumber of members present and voting:  191\r\nRequired majority:  96\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nGermany  181\r\nFinland  171\r\nFrance  171\r\nBelgium  166\r\nUnited Kingdom  161\r\nSwitzerland  160\r\nCanada  150\r\nGreece  107\r\nHaving obtained the required majority and the \r\nlargest number of votes of the members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the following 14 States are \r\nelected members of the United Nations Commission \r\non International Trade Law for a six-year term \r\nbeginning on 8 July 2019: Belgium, Canada, China, \r\nFinland, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, \r\nMalaysia, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, \r\nSwitzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland and Viet Nam.\r\nThe Acting President: I congratulate the \r\nfollowing States, which have been elected members of \r\nthe United Nations Commission on International Trade \r\nLaw for a six-year term beginning on 8 July 2019: \r\nAlgeria, Belgium, Cameroon, Canada, China, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, Croatia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, \r\nFinland, France, Germany, Ghana, Honduras, Hungary, \r\nIndonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mali, Mexico, Peru, the \r\nRepublic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Singapore, \r\nSouth Africa, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Viet \r\nNam and Zimbabwe.\r\nA/73/PV.56 17/12/2018\r\n26/26 18-44309\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 116.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in the exercise of \r\nthe right of reply, may I remind members that statements \r\nin the exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 \r\nminutes for the first intervention and five minutes for \r\nthe second and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Khashaan (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nI would like to exercise my right of reply following \r\nthe statement made by the Permanent Representative \r\nof the Syrian Arab Republic (see A/73/PV.55) about \r\nmy country.\r\nWe strongly reject the mendacious and baseless \r\nallegations made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nthe Syrian delegation against my country. We are used to \r\nhis impoliteness, lies and mendacious accusations, and \r\nare therefore not surprised that his country has violated \r\nall international laws and norms, including moral and \r\nhumanitarian laws. We would like to remind the Syrian \r\nrepresentative, who has greatly enjoyed the centuries-\r\nlong human rights involvement in his country, as well \r\nas the General Assembly, of the heinous crimes that his \r\ncountry has committed against the Syrian people, who \r\nare suffering injustice, particularly through the use of \r\ninternationally banned weapons. That tragedy has led \r\nto the external displacement of nearly 6 million people, \r\nwhereby hundreds of thousands of them are currently \r\nhosted by my country, not to mention the internal \r\ndisplacement of approximately 7 million people.\r\nMy country’s delegation would like to clarify that \r\nthe attempts of the Syrian delegation are nothing but \r\na means to cause uncertainty and hide the truth. That \r\nsame approach was used during the adoption of draft \r\nresolution 73/181 in the Third Committee. All those \r\nattempts have failed. We therefore ask the Syrian \r\ndelegation not to use such old tricks, which benefit \r\nno one.\r\nMr. Al Khalil (Syrian Arabic Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): An Arab proverb says “He who does \r\nnot possess something cannot give it away”. The \r\ntop scandal is that a Government such as that of the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is not party to the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \r\nsubmits a draft resolution on human rights. Like \r\nDa’esh, it violates human rights in the country by still \r\nbeheading its people. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has \r\nviolated human rights in Yemen by killing thousands \r\nof Yemeni children, and by supporting terrorist groups \r\nin my country, Syria. Everyone knows that the Saudi \r\nArabia Government has for decades issued fatwas \r\ncalling for killing and terrorism throughout the world. \r\nIt is responsible for religious and sectarian hatred, in \r\ncontravention of religious and moral values and the \r\nprinciple of coexistence among peoples of different \r\neconomic, social and political sytems. Saudi Arabia \r\nis the country from which takfiri thought originated, \r\nwhich destroyed the Buddhist statues in Bamiyan, \r\nAfghanistan, and was responsible for the London and \r\nMadrid underground explosions and the 9/11 attacks \r\nin New York, while also murdering Syrians and Iraqis \r\nwith car bombs and suicide belts.\r\nWhat we heard from the representative of the Saudi \r\nregime is affiliated with the Saudi pre-Islamic thought \r\nthat spread terrorism from Tora Bora Mountains \r\nin Afghanistan to Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, Libya, \r\nSyria, the Sahel region in Africa, Europe and the \r\nAmerican continent.\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to express my \r\nthanks to the interpreters for staying with us so late.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.35 p.m.\r\n"
