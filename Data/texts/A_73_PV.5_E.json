"United Nations A/73/PV.5\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n5th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 24 September 2018, 10.30 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.40 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 66 (continued)\r\nPeacebuilding and sustaining peace\r\nHigh-level plenary meeting, to be known as the \r\nNelson Mandela Peace Summit\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Before we begin \r\nwith the list of speakers, I would like to address some \r\nimportant organizational matters pertaining to the \r\nconduct of plenary meetings.\r\nI would like to appeal to all speakers to keep their \r\nstatements brief and concise in order to make maximum \r\nuse of the limited time we have for this high-level \r\nmeeting. In order to enable all on the list of speakers \r\nto be heard, statements in plenary meetings should be \r\nlimited to three minutes when speaking in a national \r\ncapacity and five minutes when speaking on behalf of a \r\ngroup, as stipulated in resolution 72/243.\r\nAs members will recall, in its resolution 72/313, of \r\n17 September 2018, the General Assembly called for \r\nstrict adherence by each speaker to time limits in the \r\nAssembly, in particular during high-level meetings. To \r\nassist speakers in managing their time, a light system \r\nhas been installed at the speaker’s rostrum. Participants \r\nwith longer statements are encouraged to read a \r\nshorter version of their text and to submit their full-\r\nlength statements to the Secretariat for posting on the \r\nPaperSmart portal.\r\nAlso in accordance with resolution 72/313, the “all \r\nprotocol observed” principle is recommended, whereby \r\nparticipants are encouraged to refrain from listing \r\nstandard protocol expressions during their statements.\r\nBearing in mind the time limit, I would like to appeal \r\nto speakers to deliver their statements at a reasonable \r\npace so that interpretation into the six official United \r\nNations languages may be properly provided.\r\nI appeal for the cooperation of all speakers in \r\nobserving the time limits for statements so that all those \r\ninscribed will be heard in a timely manner.\r\nFinally, in order to avoid disruption for the next \r\nspeaker, I urge all representatives to remain in their seats \r\nafter the delivery of each statement. In that connection, \r\nI would like to invite speakers, after delivering their \r\nstatements, to exit the General Assembly Hall through \r\nroom GA-200, located behind the rostrum, before \r\nreturning to their seats.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic \r\nof Rwanda.\r\nPresident Kagame: Nelson Mandela’s centenary \r\npresents us with an ideal moment to reflect on what \r\nthe legacy of the great African freedom fighter and \r\nstatesman means for us today. He understood that \r\na politics of confrontation and division impedes a \r\nnation’s social cohesion and progress. Even though the \r\nwounds were still fresh, he endeavoured to show that \r\nthe suffering that he and countless other South Africans \r\nhad endured could be redirected towards building a \r\nmore positive future for his country. That was not an \r\neasy message, but President Mandela was a true leader \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

He did what was right, \r\neven when it was not popular.\r\nIn Rwanda, our tragic history has taught us the \r\nimportance of unity and inclusivity for reconciliation \r\nand nation-building. We work to ensure that all citizens \r\nhave equal rights and opportunities and are able to \r\nparticipate actively in shaping our country’s direction \r\nin meaningful ways. That approach has enabled us \r\nto restore trust in public institutions and also in one \r\nanother. Inclusive and non-sectarian politics is not \r\nadvantageous in Africa only or in post-conflict \r\nsituations. As the world has seen, nation-building and \r\nnational unity are good things wherever they take place. \r\nWe are fortunate to have Nelson Mandela’s example to \r\nkeep bringing us back to that fundamental truth.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Iván \r\nDuque Márquez, President of the Republic of Colombia.\r\nPresident Duque Márquez (spoke in Spanish): On \r\n18 July 100 years ago, South Africa had the honour of \r\nbecoming the birthplace of an extraordinary human \r\nbeing. Later, the world had the honour of knowing and \r\nlearning from a great, virtuous, upright and courageous \r\nleader. Nelson Mandela was an inspirational man who \r\ntranscended attitudes and generations, because he \r\ncombined what few can achieve. He was a man, an icon, \r\na prisoner, a President, a fighter and a peacemaker. \r\nNelson Mandela’s leadership was unique.\r\nToday I am here representing a generation and \r\na country that has found inspiration in Mandela’s \r\nideals. In Colombia, we are inspired by a society that \r\nis fraternal and noble, without exclusion or hatred. \r\nWithout the exclusion that racism represents, our \r\ncountries can make great transformations. And without \r\nclass discrimination, we can build a nation with \r\nfreedom and justice, dignity and hope, one that never \r\ngives up and that desires to build peace through the law, \r\nin equality and unity, one that understands very well \r\nhow sport and culture have the power to unite all races \r\nand classes under the same flag.\r\nThat resilience, of which Nelson Mandela is a \r\nsymbol and which also characterizes Colombia, has \r\nhelped us to address violence, overcome extreme \r\npoverty and receive with open arms 1 million of our \r\nVenezuelan brothers and sisters, f leeing a terrible \r\ndictatorship. Today’s Peace Summit is an opportunity \r\nto convey to new generations what Mandela’s life \r\nsymbolized. It was a constant struggle to ensure that \r\nnone of his fellow human beings would be oppressed or \r\nenslaved by another.\r\nThe centenary of Nelson Mandela’s birth should \r\nrepresent an appeal to the world never to forget the \r\ninfinite capacity for transformation that a leader and a \r\npeople can possess when they want to correct the errors \r\nof the past and build a future. The legacy of Mandela \r\nmeans being able to rise above hatred, serving as an \r\ninspiration because this leader helped us to understand \r\nthat in spite of our differences, the things that unite us \r\nare more important.\r\nAs Mandela himself said during his trial,\r\n“I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and \r\nfree society in which all persons live together in \r\nharmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal \r\nwhich I hope to live for. But if needs be, it is an \r\nideal for which I am prepared to die.”\r\nWe in Colombia are working hard to make that \r\nideal — of a united country that builds peace through \r\nthe law — a reality.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Nana Addo Dankwa \r\nAkufo-Addo, President of the Republic of Ghana.\r\nPresident Akufo-Addo: Once in a while, someone \r\ncomes along who manages to leave an indelible imprint \r\non his generation and humankind. Nelson Mandela, the \r\nman in whose memory this plenary meeting on global \r\npeace is being held, is clearly one such person. In his \r\nown words, he dedicated his life to the struggle of the \r\nAfrican people for their freedom and development, \r\nand “cherished the ideal of a democratic and free \r\nsociety in which all persons live together in harmony \r\nand with equal opportunities”. The implementation of \r\nthat commitment not only secured for him 27 years \r\nin the apartheid prison of Robben Island, but also his \r\nundisputed place in the pantheon of the continent’s \r\nnotables as Africa’s greatest-ever leader.\r\nNelson Mandela came from prison with probably \r\nthe most recognized name in the world, and the true \r\nmeasure of the man was made evident when he helped \r\nto ensure a peaceful outcome of the negotiations among \r\nSouth Africa’s historical antagonists. Indeed, when all \r\nthe experts predicted disaster prior to the negotiations, \r\nNelson Mandela somehow managed to avert a civil war. \r\nHe held his nerve and with his calm dignity disarmed \r\nthe most determined of those who wanted a fight to \r\nthe death. After he won the historic elections of 1994, \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 3/86\r\nthere was pressure on him to give the oppressors of \r\nold a taste of their own medicine. But he stayed firm, \r\nhelped to cement the reconciliation of post-apartheid \r\nSouth Africa and left office after one successful term \r\nas President.\r\nIt falls to us who come after him to make his dream \r\nof a peaceful world a reality, in which all of us, men and \r\nwomen, young and old, live in harmony. He acted on \r\nthe proposition that with a spirit of generosity, modesty, \r\nhumility and fellow-feeling, all of us are capable of \r\ninhabiting this planet in dignity, freedom, justice and \r\nsolidarity. Let us keep alive and thereby burnish the \r\nlegacy of Nelson Mandela — Madiba. It is the legacy \r\nof a deep belief in humankind’s limitless potential \r\nfor good.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Alexander van der \r\nBellen, Federal President of the Republic of Austria.\r\nPresident van der Bellen: We have gathered here \r\ntoday to honour an extraordinary man who dedicated \r\nhis entire life to achieving global peace. We pay tribute \r\nto Nelson Mandela and to the values he defended. The \r\nfall of apartheid was not only a significant success for \r\nhis own country, South Africa, it was also a political \r\nmilestone in the endeavours to grant equal rights to \r\npeople all around the world. However, human rights \r\nhave once again come under increasing pressure. Our \r\ncommon and overarching message must be that human \r\nrights are not a special interest issue. On the contrary, \r\nhuman rights are our rights, and it is our responsibility \r\nto uphold and defend them.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nhas been a major step in our efforts to create peaceful \r\nand inclusive societies. Austria continues to support its \r\npartners in and outside of Europe in their sustainable \r\nsocial, economic and democratic development and \r\nthe establishment of the rule of law. In addition, \r\nAustria firmly believes that a world with fewer \r\nweapons, especially weapons of mass destruction, \r\nis a precondition for global peace. In that regard, we \r\nwould like to reaffirm our strong commitment to \r\neffective multilateralism.\r\nFinally, I would like to thank the Group of African \r\nStates for its initiative to hold this Summit. It affirms \r\nour unshakeable commitment to global peace and \r\nrespect for human rights, including the rejection of \r\nviolence, racism and repression. Nelson Mandela \r\ndemonstrated that a successful struggle for those goals \r\nrequires patience, courage, new ways of thinking and a \r\nreadiness for reconciliation. Let us all uphold and carry \r\non his legacy.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Lenin \r\nMoreno Garcés, Constitutional President of the Republic \r\nof Ecuador.\r\nPresident Moreno Garcés (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, I am very grateful to the United Nations for \r\nits new facilities that allow persons with disabilities to \r\naddress the General Assembly. I hope that they will set \r\nan example for the rest of the world.\r\nToday, it is an honour to commemorate here the \r\ncentenary of the birth of our beloved Nelson Mandela, \r\nwho was undoubtedly one of the greatest men in world \r\nhistory. However, I must say that I wish his prophecy did \r\nnot still ring so true: that as long as poverty, injustice \r\nand inequality persist in our world, none of us can rest. \r\nWe do not let our great people rest, because world peace \r\nhas yet to be achieved.\r\nBeloved Nelson Mandela, you were, of course, \r\nalso a man of arms, and you knew very well which \r\nwere the most effective and far-reaching. You always \r\nsaid that the best weapon is that of sitting down and \r\ntalking, because no problem is so acute that it cannot \r\nbe overcome through discussion and negotiation, if all \r\nparties are willing, instead of using force and violence.\r\nHowever, we are not heeding your advice, beloved \r\nMadiba. We have not understood that peace must first \r\nbe born in the hearts of each and every one of us. The \r\ngreat peacemakers are upright and honest people, but \r\nabove all they are humble, because one of the most \r\ndifficult things is not to change society, but to change \r\nourselves. Since no power on this Earth can destroy \r\nthe yearning for human dignity, I now believe that it \r\nis in that yearning that we will find the foundation \r\nand mortar for peacebuilding, given that overcoming \r\npoverty is not an act of charity but an act of justice, as \r\nyou stated.\r\nI thank you, teacher  of peace, because from you we \r\nlearned that our task is to liberate not the oppressed but \r\nthe oppressors. You believed that it is not generals or \r\nkings — and I would add rulers to that list — who make \r\nhistory, but the masses. You always said, “Do not judge \r\nme by my successes. Judge me by how many times I \r\nfell and got back up again”. Your compulsion to get \r\nback up, each time more triumphant, was paradoxical \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n4/86 18-29599\r\nand surprising, perhaps because you were an important \r\ntestament to the fact that we should not allow fear to get \r\nin our way. I thank you, great Mandela, for this legacy, \r\nwhich we must build on and maintain: a multicultural, \r\ndiverse society in which every man, woman and child \r\nis treated equally and a world in which all people of \r\nall races — I would prefer to speak only of the human \r\nrace — work together in harmony.\r\nThat is what will happen and that is what we who \r\nare committed to building new nations for our children \r\npromise, because, like you, they are our greatest treasure \r\nand because they are our future. Those who abuse them \r\nrend the fabric of our society and weaken our nations, \r\nbecause the sun has never set on so glorious a human \r\nachievement.  Madiba, it is our duty to ensure that the \r\nday comes when, as you said, freedom will reign.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, \r\nPresident of the Arab Republic of Egypt.\r\nPresident Al Sisi (spoke in Arabic): Today, \r\nit is a pleasure for me to participate in the Nelson \r\nMandela Peace Summit, which coincides with the \r\ncommemoration by the world and Africa of the \r\ncentennial of the birth of the late African leader, whose \r\nlegacy embodied the aspiration of the African people \r\nto independence, dignity and the elimination of all \r\nforms of discrimination. Along with other immortal \r\nsymbols of Africa, such as Nkrumah, Abdel Nasser, \r\nSékou Touré and Nyerere, he expressed the hope of \r\nestablishing the principles of equality and justice \r\namong all peoples. Mandela adhered to those principles \r\nwith honesty and dignity while he made great sacrifices \r\nto liberate his country from the abhorrent system of \r\napartheid. It is therefore natural for his people to carry \r\nhis legacy forward with unwavering loyalty and for his \r\nname to symbolize African hope and that of all peoples \r\naround the world for the enjoyment of freedom, justice \r\nand equality.\r\nI congratulate President Ramaphosa on the \r\nconvening of this commemorative Summit and on the \r\nselection of a theme that reaffirms the values of world \r\npeace in all its forms, encourages us to redouble our \r\nefforts to attain peace and sustainable development, \r\nand reasserts the principles of human rights.\r\nIn today’s world, we urgently need effective policy \r\nand operational frameworks to address the root causes \r\nof conflict, promote good governance, respect human \r\nrights in all their dimensions, and eradicate poverty and \r\nepidemics. We must also empower women and young \r\npeople with a view to truly honouring and rising to \r\nthe human aspiration of sustainable development. We \r\nmust also join hands and sincerely cooperate in order to \r\ndefeat terrorism and fight the scourges of extremism, \r\nracism, discrimination, sectarianism and intolerance.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to underscore \r\nEgypt’s support for efforts to strengthen the role of the \r\nUnited Nations in promoting integrated approaches to \r\nenhancing the Organization’s effectiveness, efficiency \r\nand credibility. The aim is to reinforce its ability to \r\nattain the goals and purposes of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations in maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, preserving the values of tolerance, mutual \r\nrespect, and understanding others. Those are the \r\nvalues that characterize the legacy of the leader Nelson \r\nMandela and serve as a shining light for multilateralism.\r\nToday’s meeting is a good opportunity to take stock \r\nof and ascertain what is lacking in the international \r\nsystem and what needs to be developed to uphold those \r\nimportant values and objectives. Nelson Mandela was \r\nand remains a symbol for the African continent, which \r\nis facing basic challenges embodied in the need of \r\nall our children for a good education that will enable \r\nthem to face the future; scarcity of water and food; \r\ndesertification; and weakness in health-care provision \r\nthat may allow diseases and epidemics to prevail in the \r\nfuture. Indeed, there is also a shortfall in international \r\ncooperation mechanisms that has led to the current \r\nsituation in Africa, which we look forward to changing \r\nwith strong will, perseverance and the courage to take \r\nhard decisions.\r\nLet us move forward together to achieve the \r\nobjectives of this historic Summit by recalling the \r\nprinciples and values adopted by the leader Nelson \r\nMandela during his struggle. Let our common goal be \r\nto offer our peoples a better future in a more peaceful \r\nand stable world.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Miguel \r\nDíaz-Canel Bermúdez, President of the Councils of \r\nState and Ministries of the Republic of Cuba.\r\nPresident Díaz-Canel Bermúdez (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We are very happy and encouraged that \r\nthe General Assembly has convened a peace summit \r\nbearing the name of Nelson Mandela.\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 5/86\r\nLess than 30 years ago, the beloved Madiba was a \r\npolitical prisoner in an apartheid jail, imprisoned for life \r\nas a result of his noble struggle for justice and equality \r\namong all the men and women of South Africa, where \r\na white minority subjected the black majority to the \r\nscorn of segregation. We have not forgotten that, during \r\nthe dark years of apartheid and long after being elected \r\nas President, Mandela and the most brilliant and honest \r\nAfrican fighters were kept on lists of alleged terrorists.\r\nCuba is honoured to recall that it shared in his \r\nstruggles on the front line of combat, together with his \r\nAfrican brothers from Angola and Namibia. We will \r\nnever forget Cuito Cuanavale. In that regard, there \r\nwas no greater recognition than the embrace of a free \r\nMandela with our historic leader, Fidel Castro, on \r\nCuban territory.\r\nI hope that we pay tribute to Mandela not only as \r\nthe first black President of South Africa and the winner \r\nof the Nobel Peace Prize, but also as a rebel who was \r\nforced to fight against injustice when peaceful paths \r\nwere closed, a political prisoner, a defender of human \r\nrights and the rights of his people, and a politician who \r\nchanged history. We are pleased that, in remembering \r\nMandela, we recognize the heroic struggle of the \r\nSouth African people against the disgraceful apartheid \r\nregime, led by the African National Congress with the \r\nsupport of many leaders and combatants who dedicated \r\ntheir lives to the cause of freedom in Africa.\r\nThe First Secretary of our Party, Army General \r\nRaúl Castro Ruz, described Mandela as a prophet \r\nof unity, reconciliation and peace. For his part, the \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Cuban revolution, Fidel \r\nCastro Ruz, defined him as an example of an absolutely \r\ncomplete man, unwaveringly strong, courageous, \r\nheroic, serene, intelligent and capable, which is how the \r\nCuban people also remember Nelson Mandela.\r\nWe are alarmed by recent announcements of \r\nincreases in military spending, which will send the \r\nworld into a new arms race, to the detriment of the \r\nenormous resources that are needed to build a world of \r\npeace. There can be no development without peace and \r\nstability or peace and stability without development. \r\nThere can be no peace and security for people suffering \r\nfrom high levels of poverty, chronic hunger and \r\nmalnutrition, poor health and limited access to drinking \r\nwater, illiteracy, high rates of infant mortality, deaths \r\nfrom preventable diseases and low life expectancy.\r\nTo achieve a world in which peace and the peaceful \r\nsolution of conflicts prevail, we must address their root \r\ncauses. The millions who are excluded by the unfair \r\ninternational economic order, the displaced, the hungry \r\nand those f leeing from war and a lack of opportunity \r\nto lands of abundance built from the plundering of \r\nour peoples are the victims of a silent and silenced \r\nsegregation. Much remains to be done in order to \r\nmake Mandela’s dreams come true. The only tribute \r\nworthy of his memory is to foster the development \r\nof disadvantaged nations. We need deeds rather than \r\nwords; cooperation, not intervention; and solidarity, \r\nnot pillage.\r\nBlood ties unite Cuba and Africa. The cultural \r\nheritage of the African continent in the idiosyncratic \r\nmake-up of Cubans is undeniable. The culture and the \r\nbest values of Africa’s peoples have nurtured our own. \r\nWe are inspired by their courage, nobility, wisdom \r\nand capacity for resistance. Cuba’s collaboration with \r\nthe peoples of Africa has been maintained for more \r\nthan 50 years as a priority of the foreign policy of the \r\nCuban revolution.\r\nInternational peace remains threatened by the \r\nphilosophy of domination. That is why we make \r\nMandela’s words our own; we too want to be masters \r\nof our own destiny. Let us therefore work for the future \r\nof peace to which our peoples are entitled. Let us truly \r\nand fully honour the unforgettable Mandela, whom the \r\nhistoric leader of the Cuban revolution called an apostle \r\nof peace.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Hage G. Geingob, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Namibia.\r\nPresident Geingob: An article by Dr. David Sack \r\non the website Psychology Today, entitled, “The Five \r\nTraits of Extraordinary Ordinary People”, listed the \r\nfive unique characteristics of the people whom we all \r\nadmire most, who live genuine, authentic and generous \r\nlives. Those traits are a focus on the things that matter, \r\nkindness, a willingness to be seen as imperfect, an \r\nability to connect and, lastly, joyfulness.\r\nThe extraordinary ordinary personality who we are \r\ncommemorating today — a man we know affectionately \r\nas Madiba — is someone who exhibited those unique \r\ntraits during his lifetime. So profound was his effect \r\non humankind that the impact of his life will resonate \r\nfor centuries to come. Madiba was a man who focused \r\non the things that mattered — the freedom and dignity \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n6/86 18-29599\r\nof his fellow human beings. He chose to forgo his own \r\nsafety, comfort and dignity and was labelled a terrorist \r\nand imprisoned for 27 years for the sake of the freedom \r\nof the oppressed peoples of apartheid South Africa and \r\nsouthern Africa.\r\nMadiba was a man of kindness — a kindness that \r\nwas genuine and that he transferred to the people of \r\nSouth Africa and the world through the concept of the \r\nrainbow nation. He believed that, through kindness, \r\nall human beings could hold hands and live in peace, \r\nharmony and understanding.\r\nMadiba was willing to be seen as imperfect. His \r\nacceptance of imperfection is encapsulated in the \r\nfamous words, “the greatest glory in living life lies not \r\nin never falling, but in rising every time we fall”.\r\nMadiba had an ability to connect. Who can forget \r\nhis trip to Orania in 1995 to meet Mrs. Betsie Verwoerd, \r\nthe widow of one of the chief architects of the apartheid \r\nsystem, Hendrik Verwoerd?\r\nMr. Arrocha Ruíz (Panama), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nFinally, Madiba had an innate joyfulness. Despite \r\nhis life of struggle, he never stopped smiling. He never \r\nstopped dancing. Madiba danced. He never stopped \r\nliving. His joyfulness permeated every facet of South \r\nAfrican life, giving rise to that famous Madiba magic, \r\nwhich was experienced at various sports arenas. Madiba \r\nonce said,\r\n“For to be free is not merely to cast off one’s \r\nchains but to live in a way that respects and \r\nenhances the freedom of others”.\r\nAs a United Nations family, let us honour that \r\nextraordinary personality by not just seeing freedom as \r\nthe casting off of chains of oppression but by living in \r\na way that respects and enhances the freedom of every \r\nhuman being on our planet.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. George Manneh Weah, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia.\r\nPresident Weah: It is an honour to stand here \r\ntoday to pay homage to Africa’s greatest hero, Nelson \r\nMandela, on the centenary of his birth. He was a man \r\nwho fought to free his people from the shackles of \r\napartheid; a man who enlightened the minds of his \r\npeople to give them courage and hope to stand against \r\nracial segregation; a man whose enemies kept him in \r\nprison doing hard labour for almost three decades and \r\ndid not succeed in breaking his spirit. When he was \r\nfreed and given the mantle of authority, he forgave his \r\ncaptors and oppressors and united South Africans of all \r\nraces into a rainbow nation.\r\nNelson Mandela was a personal hero to many and \r\na role model. He served as an inspirational reservoir \r\nof courage in the face of many adversities. Nelson \r\nMandela taught that peace comes through reconciliation \r\nbecause he believed that a reconciled nation brings \r\nabout development and prosperity for its people. That \r\nlesson has been emulated by many, including myself. \r\nI followed his philosophy and accepted the role as a \r\nUNICEF Peace Ambassador to help humankind, which \r\nhas allowed me to travel the world in the quest for peace \r\nand true reconciliation. Nelson Mandela inspired me \r\nto work tirelessly to help disarm child soldiers during \r\nLiberia’s civil crisis and bring peace to my country. As \r\nhe once said, “Courageous people do not fear forgiving, \r\nfor the sake of peace”.\r\nWe are all very fortunate to have spent time on \r\nthe same planet during his lifetime. All of our lives in \r\nmany ways are better because we have been fortunate \r\nto know him or of him — Baba Madiba, a reconciler \r\nand peacemaker. Let us honour him by promoting \r\npeace, because without peace and reconciliation our \r\nworld would not be stable.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia.\r\nPresident Lungu: It is with a great sense of honour \r\nthat Zambia has joined the rest of the international \r\ncommunity in showing appreciation for the convening \r\nof the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit, which focuses on \r\nglobal peace in honour of the centenary of the birth of \r\nNelson “Madiba” Mandela.\r\nToday I am pleased that we are able to honour \r\nthe legacy of a great leader and son of Africa, whose \r\ncontributions to global peace have remained for the \r\nworld to emulate. The principles and values that Nelson \r\nMandela and our founding fathers in Africa’s front-line \r\nStates stood for — those of sacrifice and struggle, human \r\nrights, mutual respect, tolerance and reconciliation \r\nin our relations — should remain the bedrock in our \r\nsearch for lasting peace. Love, peace and forgiveness \r\nshould continue to be at the core in seeking sustained \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 7/86\r\nglobal peace. Mandela proved to the world that healing \r\nis possible and that reconciliation remains at the heart \r\nof human development. The name of Mandela resonates \r\nwith that of the fight for freedom, not only in his native \r\nSouth Africa but in all corners of the world.\r\nIn the quest for peace and the fight against apartheid, \r\nZambia became home to many of South Africa’s \r\nfreedom fighters and was host to the African National \r\nCongress from 1963 to 1994, with its headquarters \r\nin Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia. As one of the \r\nfront-line States, Zambia actively contributed to ending \r\napartheid and minority rule in South Africa, eventually \r\nleading to the release of Nelson Mandela. Today, his \r\nlegacy of peace deserves the commendation of the \r\nentire global community.\r\nTwo weeks after his release from 27 years of \r\nincarceration, Nelson Mandela’s first visit outside \r\nSouth Africa was to Zambia. The visit was in \r\nrecognition of the efforts and great sacrifices of the \r\npeople of Zambia in upholding the valued principles of \r\npeace and freedom. They are and remain the virtues, \r\nincluding reconciliation, that form the foundation of \r\nhuman development. I therefore wish to call upon the \r\ninternational community to redouble its efforts to build \r\na just, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive and fair world by \r\nplacing human dignity at the centre of all our actions.\r\nLet me applaud the Assembly for designating the \r\nperiod 2019-2028 as the Nelson Mandela Decade of \r\nPeace. There is no doubt that it will provide our global \r\nvillage with a great opportunity to advance human \r\nrights, freedom and peace for all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\r\nPresident Mnangagwa: I wish to express my \r\nGovernment’s gratitude for the adoption of resolution \r\n72/243 in December 2017, on the holding of today’s \r\nhigh-level meeting focusing on world peace to mark \r\nthe centenary anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s \r\nbirthday. Today’s centenary celebration is indeed an \r\noccasion to reflect on his life and legacy. We applaud \r\nthe Government of the Republic of South Africa and \r\nthe United Nations for organizing various events \r\nto celebrate and keep alive the legacy and unique \r\ncontributions of Nelson Mandela. His sacrifices and \r\ntireless commitment to justice and equality, as well as \r\nhis courage, magnanimity and compassion, continue to \r\nmotivate and inspire the world.\r\nAs a great visionary, he remains a beacon of \r\npeace, and we cannot afford to let his vision fade. In \r\nspite of his long imprisonment, Nelson Mandela was \r\nnever a hostage of his past by becoming retributive. \r\nInstead, he rose above the challenges and directed his \r\nefforts towards promoting reconciliation and building \r\na peaceful, multiracial and democratic South Africa \r\nLet us be emboldened by the words of Nelson Mandela, \r\nwho said:\r\n“[D]o not look the other way. Do not hesitate. \r\nRecognize that the world is hungry for action, not \r\nwords. Act with courage and vision.”\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that \r\nhonouring Nelson Mandela without action to address his \r\nconcerns would be a betrayal of the immense sacrifice \r\nhe made in his lifetime. He once said, “sometimes it \r\nfalls upon a generation to be great. You can be that \r\ngeneration”. Indeed, we can be that great generation \r\nby providing global leadership and ensuring that his \r\ninvaluable ideals of peace, equality, human dignity \r\nand justice are realized and upheld throughout the \r\nentire world, for the betterment of present and future \r\ngenerations. I wish the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit \r\nfruitful and successful deliberations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Danny Faure, President of the Republic \r\nof Seychelles.\r\nPresident Faure: This year, a true son of Africa \r\nand a giant of history would have celebrated his 100th \r\nbirthday. Today we have come together to commemorate \r\nthe memory of a man who stood for social justice \r\nand universal peace, while also acknowledging his \r\nenduring legacy.\r\nWhen Nelson Mandela was growing up in a small \r\nvillage named Mvezo 100 years ago, there was no \r\nreason to think he would change the course of history. \r\nBut through his sacrifice, his leadership and, most \r\nimportantly, his belief in the human spirit and its \r\ninfinite capacity for good, he set an example for the \r\nworld. It is not enough that we preach the great ideals \r\nfor which he stood if we practise the opposite. We have a \r\ngolden opportunity as leaders to ensure that we govern \r\nwith the philosophies of peace and equitable progress \r\nhe championed.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n8/86 18-29599\r\nToday, I renew my commitment to living by the \r\nideals of the late Nelson Mandela and ensuring that his \r\nmessage of equality, democracy, dignity and goodness \r\nlives on through the people I have been entrusted to \r\nserve. I also believe that to fully achieve Madiba’s \r\nvision for the world, the state of our planet and only \r\nhome must be protected at all costs. If we fail to take \r\nresponsibility for our actions and the impact we are \r\nhaving on our environment, we run the grave risk of \r\ncondemning our children to the fate that he struggled \r\nduring his lifetime to abolish.\r\nA common thread unifies all our people — a \r\nlonging for peace, prosperity and an equitable future. \r\nWe must work hard to ensure that it becomes a reality. \r\nNelson Mandela said that,\r\n“to be free is not merely to cast off one’s chains, \r\nbut to live in a way that respects and enhances the \r\nfreedom of others”.\r\nWe must live and lead by that truism. Only then will we \r\nhave fulfilled his legacy.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President and \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya.\r\nPresident Kenyatta: I am equally delighted \r\nto participate in today’s historic Peace Summit in \r\nhonour of Nelson Mandela, a unique African icon. In \r\nMarch 2009, I had the unique fortune of meeting the \r\nglobal icon and that encounter left an indelible mark \r\non my life. Madiba reflected the best in us: humility, \r\nforgiveness, compassion, self lessness and integrity. He \r\ngave us a glimpse of what we could become if we set \r\nour sights on making the world a better place and have \r\nthe courage to move the obstacles that stand in the way.\r\nMadiba occupies a special place for us in Africa \r\nand, indeed, the world. We are proud heirs to his legacy \r\nand that of other heroes, such as Kwame Nkrumah of \r\nGhana, Léopold Senghor of Senegal, Mwalimu Julius \r\nNyerere of Tanzania, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, \r\nKenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Sir Seretse Khama of \r\nBotswana, just to mention a few. Those leaders planted \r\nthe seeds of freedom, pan-Africanism, development, \r\ndemocracy and peaceful coexistence. The greatest \r\nhonour we can bestow on Madiba and other African \r\nheroes is to emulate them and work determinedly \r\ntowards a united, peaceful and prosperous continent. \r\nWe should rededicate ourselves to African solidarity \r\nwith the shared values of freedom and human \r\ndignity. We should seek home-grown solutions to our \r\nchallenges and pursue amicable negotiated settlements \r\nto disputes for sustainable peace and political stability, \r\nwhich are prerequisites for meaningful social and \r\neconomic development.\r\nNelson Mandela stands as a beacon of hope for us in \r\nKenya as we continue to nurture and consolidate social \r\ncohesion and peaceful coexistence among people of \r\ndifferent ethnic groups and races. Madiba continues to \r\ninspire us to seek regional peace and political stability. \r\nOver the years, Kenya has supported peace and \r\npolitical stability in Somalia by hosting and facilitating \r\nnegotiations, contributing troops to the African Union \r\nMission in Somalia, and providing technical support. \r\nIn addition, Kenya is involved, alongside other member \r\ncountries of the Intergovernmental Authority on \r\nDevelopment, in seeking sustainable solutions in South \r\nSudan. Today, we earnestly hope that in the spirit \r\nof today’s Peace Summit, parties to the revitalized \r\nAgreement in South Sudan will set their differences \r\naside and work together in its implementation for the \r\ngood of the South Sudanese, who have borne the brunt \r\nof an unnecessary war.\r\nAs I conclude, allow me to echo the sentiments \r\nof previous speakers in supporting the adoption of \r\nthe Nelson Mandela political declaration (resolution \r\n73/1). We reaffirm our commitment to the values of \r\nNelson Mandela and to the pursuit of the ideals that \r\ndefine his legacy, including the promotion of peace, \r\nreconciliation, non-discrimination, and the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights. I welcome in particular \r\nthe recognition of the period 2019-2028 as the Nelson \r\nMandela Decade of Peace, as a constant reminder to \r\nall Members to redouble their efforts in the pursuit of \r\npeace, development and human rights for all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, President of \r\nthe Republic of Croatia.\r\nPresident Grabar-Kitarović: The great Nelson \r\nMandela said, “Give a child love, laughter and peace”. \r\nThat statement takes me back in time to the early 1990s, \r\nwhen a teary-eyed girl in a bright blue coat, literally \r\nreflecting the bleak ruins of Vukovar and thousands of \r\nworn-out people driven out from underground shelters, \r\nbecame the face of war in Croatia. Looking back, I \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 9/86\r\nrealize how far we in Croatia have come. However, \r\nas we look around the world today, 100 years after \r\nMandela’s birth and five years after his death, it seems \r\nas though there have never been so many children living \r\nwithout love, in extreme poverty or dying of hunger and \r\narmed conflict.\r\nThe migrant and refugee crisis is one of the \r\nmost pressing challenges in the world today. It \r\nbrings together all of the issues that we have been \r\ndiscussing for decades — armed conflicts, poverty, \r\nhumanitarianunger, climate change, terrorism and \r\nmany others. It is our duty to strengthen cooperation \r\nand jointly address those issues through existing \r\nmechanisms and instruments, but also to try to find \r\nnew, better and viable solutions. That duty is also part \r\nof Mandela’s legacy.\r\nWe must spare no effort to restore confidence \r\nin the institutions of the United Nations and in our \r\ncollective security. For the sake of the United Nations \r\nand its effectiveness, we should improve the way we \r\nreach collective decisions, especially in situations \r\nof grave violations of human rights and breaches of \r\ninternational humanitarian law. We should believe in \r\nbuilding strong and resilient societies, while shifting \r\nthe focus from crisis resolution to prevention, political \r\ndialogue and active engagement. That is also part of the \r\ngreat Mandela’s legacy.\r\nSpecial attention must be paid to the protection \r\nand empowerment of women and girls and their \r\nequal participation and full involvement in all social \r\nstructures. Respect for the dignity and rights of every \r\nsingle person and the values of diversity and peaceful \r\ncoexistence have no alternative. It is of vital importance \r\nto preserve the tradition of intercultural, inter-ethnic \r\nand interreligious dialogue, especially with respect to \r\nfighting violent extremism.\r\nLet me conclude with another quote from Nelson \r\nMandela — a rare global moral authority and a great \r\nAfrican. “We can change the world and make it a better \r\nplace. It is in our hands to make a difference.” Let us be \r\nthe generation that has the courage to do so.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Maithripala Sirisena, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\r\nPresident Sirisena (spoke in Sinhalese; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): Today \r\nwe are gathered here at the Nelson Mandela Peace \r\nSummit, the organization and convening of which was \r\na commendable endeavour that deserves appreciation, \r\nespecially from the people and the Government of \r\nSri Lanka.\r\nNelson Mandela was a great humanitarian and the \r\nepitome of reconciliation. He was a great leader who \r\nshowed the world the path we must all take. Today, we \r\nare gathered here to pay tribute to him because there is \r\ndearth of such leaders in the world. Nelson Mandela set \r\na great example for the world with regard to letting go \r\nof power. He showed the world what should be done by \r\nthose wielding power. When we observe today’s world, \r\nit is clear that it is taking an entirely different direction. \r\nTherefore, the world needs to recall the journey taken \r\nby Nelson Mandela.\r\nIn the world in which we live, it is clear that \r\nNelson Mandela’s qualities are lacking in many of \r\ntoday’s leaders. Peace among nations, reconciliation \r\nand humanitarianism were some of the examples set \r\nby Nelson Mandela. That is why it is very important \r\nthat world leaders take the time to study the character \r\nand journey of this great leader, including his \r\nhumanitarianism, immense love for people and feelings \r\nabout power. He was not power-hungry; he was willing \r\nto let go of power.\r\nFor more than 27 years he was not in power but he \r\nhad no desire to hold on to it once he was elected as \r\nthe leader of his nation. Therefore, we must pay tribute \r\nto this leader. I invite all world leaders to emulate the \r\njourney of the great Nelson Mandela.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Angola.\r\nPresident Lourenço (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation): We \r\ncommend the initiative of the United Nations to pay \r\na fair and well-deserved tribute to Nelson Mandela, \r\nan outstanding son of Africa and of the world, whose \r\nexample of dignity, resilience and tolerance remains a \r\nmodel of moral strength and an inpiration for millions \r\nof people fighting for social justice and the progress \r\nof humankind. The courage and political strength with \r\nwhich Nelson Mandela faced the apartheid regime \r\nin South Africa and resisted the sustained captivity \r\nimposed on him by the racist regime, as well as the \r\nforgiveness he showed to his former jailers, reconciled \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n10/86 18-29599\r\nand united South Africa and rightly earned him \r\ninternational recognition as an outstanding freedom \r\nfighter.\r\nNot only did Nelson Mandela fight for the freedom \r\nof his people; he also ensured the freedom of his \r\noppressors. We join others in paying tribute to him on \r\nthe centenary of his birth and recognize the common \r\nfight of Angolans and South Africans against racial \r\nsegregation in all its forms in favour of a free and fair \r\nsociety with equal opportunities. While paying tribute \r\nto Nelson Mandela, we should not forget the millions of \r\nanonymous freedom fighters in Angola, Mozambique, \r\nNamibia, Zimbabwe, South Africa itself and other \r\ncountries in southern African who were inspired by \r\nhis example and sacrificed their lives to transform the \r\nregion into a safe, peaceful, democratic and free place. \r\nLong live Nelson Mandela.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Botswana.\r\nPresident Masisi: It is a great honour for me to \r\naddress this gathering, convened befittingly to pay \r\ntribute to the world’s venerated Nobel Peace laureate, \r\nthe late President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. As we \r\ncelebrate the centennial of a man who lived as the \r\nembodiment of the liberation struggle, we should be \r\nreminded of his sacrifice and the legacy of peace he \r\nbequeathed to future generations. Today we bask in the \r\nvery freedom that he fought for with gusto. We can only \r\ntruly honour him by jealously guarding the freedom we \r\nso greatly enjoy.\r\nMy own country, Botswana, as a founding member \r\nof the front-line States — a coalition of countries \r\nthat sought to end apartheid and white-minority rule \r\nin southern Africa — made a modest contribution \r\nto the liberation struggle. Botswana provided safe \r\nhaven and assisted the freedom fighters in any way \r\nwe could, sometimes with dire repercussions from \r\nthe South African apartheid regime. We tactfully and \r\nskilfully defied the ultimatums issued to us, as we fully \r\nunderstood that none of us could be truly free when \r\nour brothers and sisters next door remained under the \r\nshackles of oppressive regimes. We contributed to the \r\narmed struggle without bearing arms ourselves. We \r\njoined in the great jubilation following the release of \r\nNelson Mandela in 1990 and equally in 1994, when he \r\nwas inaugurated as President of a free South Africa. We \r\nremain humbled that Botswana was the first country \r\nthat Nelson Mandela visited in 1962, in his quest for \r\ninternational support for the liberation struggle, and \r\nagain upon his release from prison in 1990.\r\nI am confident that if Mandela were here today \r\nhe would without reservation endorse our mantra of \r\nleaving no one behind. Let us therefore leave here with \r\nthese words of Rolihlahla himself:\r\n“No one is born hating another person because \r\nof the colour of his skin, or his background, or his \r\nreligion. People must learn to hate, and if they can \r\nlearn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love \r\ncomes more naturally to the human heart than \r\nits opposite.”\r\nIn conclusion, Botswana fully endorses the Mandela \r\nPeace Summit political declaration (resolution 73/1). \r\nIt is an honour befitting an exceptionally great man \r\nand one of the greatest leaders of our time. He lived a \r\npurpose-driven life that has touched and enriched us \r\nall, directly or indirectly. Let us do good by him for we \r\nare all better off for having been touched by him.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Adama Barrow, President of the \r\nRepublic of The Gambia.\r\nPresident Barrow: It is with much esteem that I \r\nwish to pay tribute to Madiba Nelson Mandela on the \r\ncentenary of his birth and underscore the importance \r\nof today’s Peace Summit, organized to recognize and \r\nhonour the enduring legacy of a very special world \r\ncitizen — a man of peace and compassion and a strong \r\ndefender of social justice and equality.\r\nThe whole world has noted with admiration that, \r\nin spite of the unique situation in his homeland, his \r\nlifelong struggle was not solely about liberating South \r\nAfrica from injustice and oppression; rather, it was \r\nabout making the entire world a better place for all. \r\nThat made Nelson Mandela a noble, global citizen \r\nwith a global vision for humankind. As we devote this \r\nPeace Summit to celebrating the centenary of his birth, \r\nI submit that we should reflect on some of the lessons \r\nfrom his life for the betterment of our world.\r\nToday, racism, the dislike of foreigners, modern-\r\nday slavery and intolerance are as rife across the \r\nworld as never before. It is a paradox that the evils that \r\nMandela struggled against decades ago persist, and \r\nin fact pose a threat to his dream of a better world. It \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 11/86\r\nis wise and fitting, therefore, that world leaders draw \r\nfrom his wisdom, strength and resolve to stamp out \r\nsuch vices and transform the world into a safer and \r\nbetter place for all.\r\nWhen Nelson Mandela devoted his life to truth, \r\nnational reconciliation and healing in post-apartheid \r\nSouth Africa, he was living what he believed in. \r\nMandela believed in dialogue and reconciliation as \r\nnecessary elements for brokering, promoting and \r\nmaintaining peace. That makes it necessary for all \r\nleaders to draw inspiration from his statesmanship, to \r\nbe genuine in word and in deed, and to work closely \r\nto stop all conflicts from developing and raging on. \r\nThat is particularly relevant to Africa, where conflicts \r\ncontinue to erupt. The world at large, and Africa in \r\nparticular, does not only have a distinguished statesman \r\nto emulate in Madiba, but also a mission to fulfil. \r\nMandela left behind the unfinished mission of attaining \r\nglobal peace and progress.\r\nAs his strategy, Nelson Mandela devoted his life \r\nto preventive diplomacy and the peaceful resolution of \r\nconflicts, and he intervened at critical moments to end \r\nconflicts and discord across Africa and beyond. He won \r\nmany hearts by continuing that mediating role as an \r\nelder statesman, even after he left office as President. \r\nIn that light, I call on the United Nations, the African \r\nUnion and all regional organizations to promote and \r\ninvest in preventive diplomacy, and to participate \r\nactively in efforts for mediation and conflict resolution.\r\nMandela’s exemplary leadership qualities will \r\nremain a source of inspiration for posterity. His \r\nenduring legacy is his struggle to make the world a \r\nbetter place for all. Let us honour that legacy today with \r\nthe pledge that, as we leave this hallowed Hall, we will \r\nrededicate our lives to making the world a better place \r\nfor all. I would like to end with a timeless quotation \r\nfrom a landmark statement by Mandela to the General \r\nAssembly in 1994. He said,\r\n“The millions across our globe who stand \r\nexpectant at the gates of hope look to this \r\nOrganization to bring them peace, to bring them life, \r\nto bring them a life worth living.” (A/49/PV.14, p. 10)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran.\r\nPresident Rouhani (spoke in Farsi; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): At the \r\noutset, I would like to offer prayers for the peaceful \r\nrest of the martyred souls who were killed on Saturday \r\nduring the cowardly terrorist attacks in the city of \r\nAhvaz and declare the ever more resolute stance of my \r\nnation in the fight against terrorism in all its forms.\r\nToday’s commemoration by the General Assembly \r\nof the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela is a \r\npraiseworthy message of support for global peace. \r\nNelson Mandela’s long and formidable journey to \r\nfreedom — from his birth and childhood in a small \r\nvillage to his joining the anti-racism movement, which \r\nresulted in long years of imprisonment and his ultimate \r\nrestoration to freedom and rise to presidency — are \r\ndistinctive and unique in contemporary history.\r\nMandela was a close and loyal friend of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran in the years prior to the victory of the \r\nIslamic revolution. The royal regime in Iran at the time \r\nhad established very strong relations with the Zionist \r\nentity and the apartheid regime, which were among the \r\nclosest allies of the United States of America. During \r\nthose years, Iran was the main supplier of energy to \r\nboth regimes. However, following the victory of the \r\nIslamic revolution and inspired by the will of its people \r\nto support the South African liberation movement, the \r\nIranian Government severed all relations with both \r\nthe Zionist and the apartheid regimes. Following the \r\ncollapse of the apartheid regime and the establishment \r\nof democracy in South Africa, relations between Iran \r\nand South Africa entered a new phase that continues \r\nto develop.\r\nThe suffering endured through hard times of \r\nstruggle did not compel Mandela to abandon his \r\nmethods, which were based on the pursuit of peace \r\nand accord. The way Mandela treated his enemies and \r\nopponents after his release from prison was so merciful \r\nthat he sowed the seeds of amity and compassion in their \r\nhearts. It is a historical reality that great statesmen tend \r\nto build bridges rather than walls. While racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination and xenophobia make it easier to build \r\nwalls instead of bridges between nations, it is dialogue, \r\ntolerance and peaceful coexistence that constitute the \r\nbuilding blocks to overcome differences and divisions.\r\nI strongly believe that Nelson Mandela was one \r\nof the greatest men in contemporary history who \r\nconsidered the establishment of peace and friendship \r\nas an absolute necessity rather than a mere expediency. \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n12/86 18-29599\r\nOver the past decades, the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nhas spoken in the Assembly to inspire such initiatives \r\nas dialogue among civilizations and a world against \r\nviolence and extremism, pursuant to efforts to \r\nstrengthen multilateralism and develop international \r\npeace and cooperation. Iran remains firm and resolute \r\nin that intention and warmly greets all pro-peace and \r\npro-tolerance leaders.\r\nA remedy for racism, xenophobia, violence and \r\nhatred must be sought through dialogue, tolerance and \r\ndemocracy. That is the same path that Mandela bravely \r\nforged for real and genuine statesmen. The name and \r\nmemory of that great man shall live on eternally. May \r\nhis soul rest in peace.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Jorge Carlos De Almeida Fonseca, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cabo Verde.\r\nPresident Fonseca (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): Along \r\nwith freedom, peace and the stability that it enables \r\nand progress that it promotes is undoubtedly the \r\ngreatest public asset for humankind and interaction \r\namong nations. Nelson Mandela, the great symbol of \r\npeace, naturally inspires and guides us as States and \r\nnations in our reflection, action and responsibility to \r\ndo everything possible so that the world may achieve \r\nglobal peace.\r\nUnfortunately, even in this first quarter of the \r\ntwenty-first century, we continue to lament the \r\nexistence and proliferation of new conflicts, resulting in \r\nmore suffering and destruction of life. In this seventieth \r\nyear since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, many grey areas persist and continue \r\nto blemish the face of human dignity. Three years after \r\nadopting the Sustainable Development Goals for our \r\npeople and our planet, women and men face the risk of \r\nbeing left behind if we do not find solutions to finance \r\nthe achievement of the Goals established for 2030.\r\nFortunately, it is not all doom and gloom if \r\nwe turn to examples that point us in the right \r\ndirection — examples where conflicts have ended or \r\nbeen avoided, human rights have been promoted and \r\npoverty has been reduced. Those examples support the \r\nvision of the Secretary-General, whom I congratulate \r\nfor establishing a mutual relationship of cause and effect \r\nbetween sustaining peace and sustainable development. \r\nLet us follow examples where political dialogue has \r\nprevented the outbreak of conflict and development \r\nhas enhanced the possibilities for peace. Finally, let us \r\nfollow the examples set by Nelson Mandela’s actions of \r\npolitical struggle, as well as tolerance and advocacy for \r\nthe ideals of justice.\r\nFor Cabo Verde, in its struggle for emancipation \r\nfrom colonialism, Nelson Mandela’s example was more \r\nthan a point of reference; it was an anchor. The peace \r\nwe have preserved since independence has been our \r\ngreatest achievement. It has allowed us to progressively \r\nrestore a democratic rule of law that respects and \r\nprotects fundamental rights and freedoms. We believe \r\nthat the example of Cabo Verde, albeit small, is still a \r\npowerful example of our intrinsic strength. Just as we \r\nhave relied on international solidarity, our contribution \r\nto a world with more peace and development lies in the \r\nmodest contribution of our example and in working in \r\nsolidarity with others. May we honour the memory of \r\nNelson Mandela. May we have peace and development \r\nthroughout the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, President of the \r\nPortuguese Republic.\r\nPresident Rebelo de Sousa (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation): \r\nIn 1993, Madiba visited Portugal. He had just won \r\nhis freedom, and soon afterwards he would be freely \r\nelected as President of South Africa. In Portugal, he \r\nwas greeted enthusiastically, as people embraced his \r\ntestimony of the victory over oppression. Portugal \r\nhad recently triumphed over its own oppression and \r\nhad ended its colonial rule following the Carnation \r\nRevolution. Nelson Mandela saluted that revolution, \r\nstating that it was also an inspiration for people that \r\nremained predominantly repressed.\r\nAt the same time, he spoke to more than half a \r\nmillion Portuguese of the consolidation, peace and \r\nintegration of the future South Africa. That was Nelson \r\nMandela in all his courage, in his humanity, in his \r\nintelligence, in the simplicity of his compassion, in his \r\ngreatness of soul and in his long road to freedom. It was \r\nthat inspiration that prevailed in resolving crises such \r\nas that in Timor-Leste.\r\nHe showed the world that it is always worth trying \r\nand that nothing is impossible; that in our personal \r\nbattles, we are capable of conquering fear with hope \r\nand can overcome hatred with love and forgiveness. \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 13/86\r\nThat is why Mandela’s legacy must be supported and \r\nwhy Portugal supports the Nelson Mandela Decade of \r\nPeace 2019-2028. I salute those awarded the United \r\nNations Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela Prize: the former \r\nPresident of Portugal, Jorge Sampaio, and Dr. Helena \r\nNdume of Namibia, for their work on youth, the future \r\nand education, particularly in critical areas.\r\nThe legacy of Mandela, aligned with the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights, leads us to believe that we can and \r\nmust invest in the future, not only through declarations, \r\nwhich are fundamental, and not only through words, \r\nbut through hard work and in such a way that the world \r\nitself may become a better place — a peaceful place \r\nwhere no one is left behind. Nelson Mandela was not \r\nonly an exceptional man, he was clearly one of the \r\ngreatest of us all.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will how \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Juan Carlos \r\nVarela Rodríguez, President of the Republic of Panama.\r\nPresident Varela Rodríguez (spoke in Spanish): \r\nIn commemorating the centenary of the birth of Nelson \r\nMandela, we must speak of his legacy, which is nothing \r\nless than a commitment to overcoming social inequality \r\nand racial discrimination at the global level. We must \r\nrecognize his dedication to the service of humankind, \r\nhis humanitarian vocation and his tireless efforts to \r\npromote and protect human rights, reconciliation, \r\nsolidarity and democracy. He was a promoter of the \r\nculture of peace, to which he devoted his life.\r\nMandela continues to be a source of inspiration \r\nand an example of courage and compassion for all, \r\nembodying the values  and essence that should guide \r\nthe Organization. As he once stated, our greatest \r\nweapon, which the enemy can never resist, is peace. As \r\na multi-ethnic and multicultural country that respects \r\ndiversity and tolerance, Panama staunchly believes that \r\ncountries should gear their capacities towards solving \r\nthe problems that life brings, rather than those that we \r\ncreate for ourselves.\r\nAt the current global juncture, in which war and \r\nconflicts are the main causes of mass migrations — to the \r\ngrief and pain of which Panama has borne witness — it \r\nis imperative to champion and strengthen the principles \r\nof non-violence. Having partnered to achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, my country today \r\nrenews its commitment to national, regional and \r\nglobal actions for the promotion of peace, as we firmly \r\nbelieve that they are essential to achieving the other \r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nLikewise, we recognize the role that young people \r\ncan and must play in the prevention of conflicts, violence \r\nand even in the consolidation of peace processes, for \r\nwhich we note the value and obligation of paving the \r\nway to promote their inclusion and active participation. \r\nIn welcoming the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace \r\n2019-2028, Panama renews its commitment to actively \r\nand constructively contribute to the global peace \r\nagenda and to maximize the scope of our collective \r\nefforts as an essential tool for a more peaceful and \r\nprosperous world.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will how \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Tommy Esang \r\nRemengesau Jr., President of the Republic of Palau.\r\nPresident Remengesau: Today, we honour the \r\nlegacy of a great leader and great humanitarian, \r\nMr. Nelson Mandela, as we carry on his work to \r\npromote peace, eliminate the weapons of war and repair \r\nthe damage of colonial legacies through reconciliation \r\nand racial and gender equality. Palau is still grappling \r\nwith its own history of being colonized by several \r\nmajor Powers. Our matrilineal system of governance \r\nhad served us well, with our people living sustainably \r\nfor thousands of years. Land and resources were \r\nmanaged through clan- and village-based systems \r\nwithout the need for private property. Cooperative work \r\narrangements were the norm.\r\nForeign Powers attempted to impose their modern \r\nconcepts of order and commerce, which forced us to \r\nintegrate traditional systems into an uneasy hybrid. \r\nWe have seen first-hand the turmoil of the world’s \r\nimperial legacies. The forced transition ignited bitter \r\npower struggles that sometimes erupted into violence \r\npreviously unseen in our country. Those new systems, \r\ninitially understood by few Palauans, left us open to \r\nexploitation by those with the knowledge and the \r\nmoney. Palauans are very adaptive people, however, \r\nand so we have done our best to navigate this difficult \r\nperiod of our history without sacrificing the values that \r\nmake our islands such a special place. The protection \r\nof our local environment remains a guiding principle, \r\ndespite the pressures of a global economy that would \r\nmonetize our natural spaces for short-term gain.\r\nMr. Gertze (Namibia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n14/86 18-29599\r\nThe Pacific region also has a painful history with \r\nweapons of war. More than 2,000 nuclear tests have \r\ntouched peoples and communities in many regions, \r\nincluding in the Pacific. Nuclear tests have negatively \r\nimpacted the environment, human health, food \r\nsecurity and economic development. Weapons of mass \r\ndestruction have no place in this world, and we urge the \r\nachievement of the complete, verifiable and irreversible \r\ndismantling of such weapons and ballistic missiles of \r\nall ranges. We remain committed to the need to ensure \r\nthat nuclear weapons are never used again.\r\nThe greatest tribute we can pay to the great Madiba \r\nis to carry on his legacy with the same single-minded \r\npurpose that defined his life, first as a revolutionary in \r\nhis own country and then as a revered global statesman. \r\n“May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears”, \r\nas he once said. That should be our mantra as we all \r\nstrive to follow his example.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Ilir Meta, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Albania.\r\nPresident Meta: I would like to join previous \r\nspeakers in welcoming the adoption of the political \r\ndeclaration (resolution 73/1). I also congratulate the \r\norganizers and co-facilitators for convening the Nelson \r\nMandela Peace Summit and reminding us of the image \r\nof the man who inspired the whole world with his \r\ncommitment to peace and reconciliation, as well as his \r\ndedication and persistence in fighting and protecting \r\nhuman rights.\r\nIn recognizing the period 2019-2028 as the Nelson \r\nMandela Decade of Peace, we States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations commit ourselves to greater joint efforts \r\nand collectively hold ourselves accountable to the \r\nvalues and principles of that declaration. In Albania, \r\nwe have had our own Mandelas who, for decades during \r\nthe communist regime, were cruelly persecuted and \r\ndeprived of their freedom and liberty because of their \r\nideas and beliefs. However, they survived to tell us and \r\nencourage us to be more tolerant and respectful of each \r\nother’s faith, beliefs and ethnicity. We should act and \r\nfight together for those values.\r\nAs we speak, there are many violent conflicts \r\naround the world, great potential for proxy warfare \r\nthat must be prevented, and humanitarian crises to be \r\nconfronted. There are many violations of human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms, and our goal for global \r\npeace is yet to be achieved. In all those dimensions \r\nof volatility, there is a legacy of people who have \r\nbeen fighting for peace and of nations fighting for a \r\npeaceful future.\r\nToday, we seek new ways to better promote \r\nsustaining peace and make the best use of prevention \r\nwith a long-term perspective. In that respect, Albania \r\nconsiders that we need a whole-of-society approach, \r\nbacked by strong institutions and the rule of law, human \r\nsecurity, inclusive development and the full enjoyment \r\nof human rights for all. On the eve of the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, I would like to highlight that human rights \r\nare a critical foundation for peace and that resilience \r\nis anchored in the synergies between fulfilling human \r\nrights and the peaceful coexistence of societies.\r\nGiven that human rights are universal, they \r\nconstitute the backbone of our societies in building \r\npeace and guaranteeing security and stability. The \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and its goal of fostering peaceful, just \r\nand inclusive societies leads us towards the promotion \r\nof prevention as a step towards the culture of peace \r\nand ensuring peaceful coexistence between nations, \r\nsocieties, communities and individuals.\r\nThe adoption of the Secretary-General’s reforms \r\non peace and security, which Albania supports, is \r\na new approach to responding efficiently to fragile \r\nnations and vulnerable societies, preventing conflicts \r\nand building a more durable and just peace. I believe \r\nthat fostering political dialogue and strengthening \r\nmultilateralism are the best ways to promote rule-based \r\nglobal societies based on the values of human rights \r\nand respect for international law. To deny people their \r\nhuman rights is to challenge their very humanity, as \r\nNelson Mandela taught us.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Borut Pahor, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Slovenia.\r\nPresident Pahor: Nelson Mandela once said: \r\n“Negotiation and discussion are the greatest weapons \r\nwe have for promoting peace”. There is no better place \r\nto do that than the United Nations. We certainly have \r\nall the necessary tools, as set out in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. The question is, however: Do we also \r\nhave the political will?\r\nThe United Nations was established to save future \r\ngenerations from the tragedy of war by binding us in a \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 15/86\r\nrules-based order, with the United Nations Charter at its \r\ncore. For the system to work, every Member State must \r\nabide by and defend the rules-based order prescribed by \r\nthe Charter. That is not just a matter of political will; it \r\nis an actual legal obligation. I would now like to focus \r\non four brief messages.\r\nFirst, without respect for human rights, there \r\ncan be no peace and security, nor can there be \r\ndevelopment. Violations and abuses of human rights \r\ncontinue in many parts of the world. Secondly, we \r\nneed to think and rethink our approach to peace. \r\nFirst and foremost, we need to put more emphasis on \r\npreventing and addressing the root causes of conflict \r\nand instability. For that, Slovenia strongly supports the \r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to reorient the international \r\ncommunity’s thinking on crisis and conflict prevention. \r\nIn that context, mediation is a very important tool. \r\nAlthough every mediation situation is unique, the use \r\nof that instrument generates hope and the possibility of \r\npeaceful solutions to conflicts.\r\nThe third message is accountability and the final \r\nmessage, which is very important, is reconciliation. \r\nI think that is the legacy of Nelson Mandela. There \r\nare many people who are capable of revenge, but not \r\nmany who can forgive. Nothing is more inspiring than \r\nthe power of forgiveness. After all, I think Mandela \r\ngives us hope that even the impossible is possible. The \r\nessential point of his legacy is that important issue of \r\nreconciliation. Long live Madiba.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar \r\nKeita, President of the Republic of Mali.\r\nPresident Keita (spoke in French): At the outset, I \r\nwelcome the initiative of convening the Nelson Mandela \r\nPeace Summit to celebrate the life of an exceptional man \r\nthat is full of lessons for current and future generations. \r\nI am deeply moved by the wealth of testimony for the \r\nmost illustrious of political prisoners of the twentieth \r\ncentury. The late President Madiba spent 27 consecutive \r\nyears of his life in prison as a class D prisoner — the \r\nlowest class — from his registration in 1964 as prisoner \r\nnumber 466/64 at Robben Island prison.\r\nOne needs to have visited Robben Island — to \r\nhave been in the prison cell where Madiba spent those \r\n27 years and seen the tiny bed on which he had to \r\nsqueeze his substantial body for 27 years. One can only \r\nimagine the damage that inflicted on his knees and \r\nlegs. We witnessed his journey of shame; we saw his \r\nsuffering; we saw how our brother was dehumanized. \r\nAnd yet, it made him even stronger. Why did Madiba \r\nmake that sacrifice? It was for the noble cause of the \r\ntriumph of freedom, peace, equality, justice, solidarity \r\nand tolerance. Upon his release, Nelson Mandela \r\nwas able to give all of humankind a great lesson in \r\nforgiveness, reconciliation and unity by launching the \r\nconcept of the rainbow nation in South Africa.\r\nI still remember that, when he was elected President \r\nof his country in the post-apartheid era, President \r\nMandela made an appeal at his inauguration to the South \r\nAfrican people for unity of action: “None of us acting \r\nalone can achieve success”. That call remains relevant \r\ntoday if we want to promote world peace, respect for \r\nhuman rights and inclusive development.\r\nFor its part, Mali supported the legitimate fight \r\nof Nelson Mandela. In April 1962, Madiba led a \r\ndelegation of the African National Congress to Mali \r\nand approached Modibo Keita, requesting the support \r\nof our people in the struggle against apartheid. When \r\nOliver Tambo described the purpose of their visit, \r\nModibo replied:\r\n“If you, our brothers of Azania, had not risen to \r\nfight back against the inhuman conditions that have \r\nbeen imposed on you, I, Modibo Keita, would have \r\nfound you unworthy of Chaka.”\r\nI was Prime Minister of Mali when Madiba \r\nreturned to our country at the invitation of President \r\nAlpha Oumar Konaré, and we welcomed him in a \r\nway that was worthy of his struggle and status, but he \r\ndemonstrated great modesty and care for others during \r\nhis visit. For me, during the two days that I was in his \r\ncompany, I was struck by his humility and the greatness \r\nof his soul. Today, I am here on behalf of my country to \r\npay a deserved tribute to him, not only out of routine, \r\nbut out of a duty of the heart, a duty of dignity, and a \r\nduty of gratitude to one of the most deserving Africans \r\nof this and the previous century.\r\nMali fully endorses the political declaration \r\n(resolution 73/1) adopted at this Summit. I conclude by \r\npaying a warm tribute to the life and work of the great \r\nNobel Peace Prize winner. May his example continue \r\nto inspire us to build and consolidate peace throughout \r\nthe world.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Teodoro \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n16/86 18-29599\r\nObiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of the Republic of \r\nEquatorial Guinea.\r\nPresident Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke \r\nin Spanish): We are here today to remember and \r\ncommemorate the personal character and legacy of \r\nthat illustrious son of Africa, Nelson Mandela, as we \r\ncelebrate the centenary of his birth. The greatness of \r\nhis character is highlighted by the fact that, a century \r\nafter his birth, his example, his teachings and his life \r\ntestimony remain relevant in a world that continues \r\nto suffer injustices, wars, conflicts, discrimination, \r\njealousy and crimes of every kind against humanity.\r\nRecalling Mandela’s personal characteristics \r\nshould lead us to reflect deeply on where we are taking \r\nthe world and what legacy we will leave our children. \r\nMandela’s teachings are valid not only for us Africans. \r\nRather, they should serve as an inspiration and example \r\nfor all human beings who strive to make this world a \r\nbetter place to live.\r\nHis vision is a guide to overcoming the many \r\nobstacles and limitations that some humans impose on \r\nothers, as was the case in the apartheid regime of South \r\nAfrica and in global colonialism. Indeed, Mandela \r\nrepresents an example and hope for peoples that are still \r\nstruggling to achieve equality and integration. Despite \r\nhaving been unjustly deprived of his liberty for 27 \r\nyears, he was capable of overcoming his imprisonment \r\nto come to live with and forgive his tormentors.\r\nMandela’s thought has been incorporated by the \r\nOrganization in order to build a new world of human \r\nsociety. As former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nsaid in July 2009,\r\n“Nelson Mandela is the living incarnation of the \r\nvalues that the United Nations represents”.\r\nWe in Equatorial Guinea, we have drawn inspiration \r\nfrom the Mandela legacy in many of the actions we \r\nhave undertaken to secure and maintain harmonious \r\ncoexistence among the people of Equatorial Guinea \r\nand to achieve the economic development and well-\r\nbeing of our country. It is timely that we have gathered \r\nhere at the beginning of the general debate of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session in order \r\nto celebrate the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit. We \r\nhope that the spirit of Mandela will guide our thoughts \r\nand actions in order to make our Organization and \r\nthe entire world a place that this worthy son of Africa \r\nwould have dreamed of. We hope that this session will \r\nenable us to embark upon a new era in international \r\nrelations and coexistence among the peoples imbued \r\nwith Mandela’s spirit.\r\nWe subscribe to the political declaration adopted at \r\nthe opening of the Peace Summit (resolution 73/1).\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Azali \r\nAssoumani, President of the Union of Comoros.\r\nPresident Assoumani (spoke in French): A few days \r\nafter the moving tribute to the late Secretary-General \r\nKofi Annan, the United Nations is commemorating \r\nthe centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela, a son of \r\nAfrica who has left humankind an exceptional legacy. \r\nEach of those persons, in his own way and on his \r\nown journey, is celebrated by us for several reasons, \r\nparticularly for their unique contribution to all nations \r\nand people working for the maintenance of peace. This \r\nPeace Summit in honour of the late Nelson Mandela, \r\npursuant to resolution 72/243, of 22 December 2017, is a \r\nworthy tribute to a man who sacrificed a quarter of his \r\nlong life to the fight for the emancipation of his people, \r\nand of Africa in general, and against colonialism and \r\nimperialism through his categorical rejection of racism \r\nand its institutionalized form — apartheid.\r\nThat fight, however, had an impact far beyond the \r\nAfrican continent. He was a charismatic leader who \r\nwas ready to sacrifice his life to that noble cause. He \r\nwas as firmly opposed to white domination, a legacy \r\nof the slave mentality, as he was to the prospect of \r\nblack domination, which would have been vindictive. \r\nIn that context, after having lived through South \r\nAfrica’s attempt to deny a people’s humanity through \r\nsegregation, Mandela embodied what Albert Einstein, \r\nspeaking of Gandhi, which was that  \r\n“generations to come ... will scarcely believe \r\nthat such a one as this walked the Earth in f lesh \r\nand blood.”\r\nConsidering the plight of powerless minorities \r\nworldwide and the persistence of the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict, among so many other factors that fuel threats \r\nto global peace, paying tribute to Mandela is also \r\nneeded, and perhaps above all, in order to perpetuate \r\nthe memory of a man who, after having been subjected \r\nto the worst hardships and frustrations and condemned \r\nto life imprisonment with his peers, never stopped \r\ndreaming that one day he and his countrymen would \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 17/86\r\nbuild a rainbow nation reflecting the history of the \r\nSouth African people.\r\nForgiveness was instituted as a governing method \r\nthrough the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and \r\nthat strategy is already a watermark of the negotiations \r\namong the South African people. It has led to the results \r\nwe know well, with Mandela being awarded the Nobel \r\nPeace Prize jointly with former President Frederik de \r\nKlerk, as had been the case with the historic Palestinian \r\nleader Yasser Arafat along with former Prime Minister \r\nRabin and former Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.\r\nAdditionally, on behalf of the Union of Comoros, \r\nI would be remiss if I did not pay tribute to Mandela’s \r\npersonal contribution, on behalf of the African Union, \r\nto the settlement of the institutional and separatist crisis \r\nin Comoros in 1998.\r\nWe recognize Mandela’s importance for global \r\nsustainable peace, especially in the face of the ugly and \r\ncriminal face of international terrorism. The General \r\nAssembly adopted resolution 72/243 in 2017 with a \r\nview to holding this Summit, which highlights a unique \r\nperson — a man who absolutely refused to be defeated \r\nand who was able to overcome all obstacles to come \r\nto understand that living and dying in peace meant \r\nrecognizing the full humanity of the other.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Arthur \r\nPeter Mutharika, President of the Republic of Malawi.\r\nPresident Mutharika: One hundred years after \r\nhis birth, it is proper to commemorate the legacy \r\nof Nelson Mandela and his role in global peace. The \r\nglobal peace agenda is at the very heart of Malawi’s \r\npolicies. Malawi is a peace-loving country. We are \r\ntherefore committed to ensuring that there is total \r\npeace and tranquillity in the world. Every human \r\nbeing deserves to live in a peaceful environment with \r\npeace of mind. With our support, the African Union \r\nwill carry out its Master Roadmap of Practical Steps to \r\nSilence the Guns in Africa by 2020. Malawi will always \r\ngo out to defend peace wherever it is under threat. We \r\nwill continue participating in peace-loving missions \r\nwherever duty calls us to do so. Malawi has moved to \r\ndevelop counter-terrorism legislation and is party to \r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological \r\nWeapons Convention.\r\nHowever, the United Nations would make more \r\nprogress and do a better job of maintaining peace if \r\nit involved Africa in its decision-making processes. \r\nWe therefore call upon the United Nations to expedite \r\nthe debate on Security Council reform. We call upon \r\nthe United Nations to adopt the African position in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus. We call upon the United Nations \r\nto accommodate Africa with two permanent seats on \r\nthe Security Council. As we celebrate the life of Nelson \r\nMandela, I ask all of us to reflect on the role that \r\nMandela played in peacebuilding. Let us reflect on the \r\nrole Africa might play in the world today. The world \r\nneeds Africa more than ever. Let us rise up and take our \r\nplace in the global community.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the \r\nEuropean Commission.\r\nMr. Juncker (European Union) (spoke in French): \r\nThe great Nelson Mandela once said that “it always \r\nseems impossible until it is done”. That is the most apt \r\ndescription of the performance of the founding fathers \r\nof the European Union, on behalf of whom it is my \r\nhonour to address the General Assembly this morning.\r\nThe European Union was born of the will of those \r\nwho, having returned from the fields of battle and \r\nconcentration camps in 1945, turned the phrase “never \r\nagain to war” into a reality by countering the force \r\nof weapons with the force of law, and the rejection of \r\nothers with solidarity with others. The primary aim of \r\nthe European Union has always been to be a force for \r\npeacekeeping. Its actions must extend far beyond the \r\nborders of Europe. Since it is our relentless obligation \r\nto assume our global responsibilities, we must have a \r\npresence in the world.\r\nSince the world belongs to us all, not just a \r\nfew, and all peoples have the right to same dignity, \r\nmultilateralism will always be the guiding principle \r\nof our global action. There is no happy unilateralism \r\nor protectionism. The world must become more open. \r\nIt needs cooperation, rules and principles to resolve \r\nconflicts, to eradicate poverty, to reduce inequality, to \r\ndevelop free and fair trade that will create jobs and new \r\nopportunities for all and to preserve our planet — the \r\nindivisible heritage of all humankind.\r\nOur shared rules, agreed freely by each of us, do \r\nnot limit us. On the contrary, they free us from the \r\nlaw of the jungle and render each of us stronger. We \r\nshould also enhance our respect for our multilateral \r\ninstitutions, which are certainly not perfect, but that is \r\nno reason to call them into question or withdraw from \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n18/86 18-29599\r\nthem. Rather, we should pool our efforts to reform \r\nthem, modernize them and breathe new life into them. \r\nThat is what we should do with the United Nations, the \r\nkeystone of multilateralism and the guarantor of peace \r\nand the world order. My friend António Guterres knows \r\nthat he can count on the full support of the European \r\nUnion for completing the reform of the Organization \r\nso that its functions and ambitions are adapted to our \r\ntwenty-first century world.\r\nTomorrow, like today, the European Union will \r\ncontinue to assume its responsibilities in the efforts \r\nto achieve the great aims of the United Nations, \r\nsupport of which is more critical than ever. I am \r\nreferring particularly to the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, to which we \r\nhave contributed significantly and which requires the \r\nmobilization of all of our policies and financial means.\r\nIt is a unique privilege and lasting inspiration to \r\nhave been able to meet Mandela. His words continue \r\nto resonate within me today. He came from a cousin \r\ncontinent — a young, noble and promising continent. \r\nAfrica is linked to Europe through our shared destiny. It \r\nis a neighbour with whom we wish to forge ever-stronger \r\nties. An alliance among our continents — among \r\nequals — is the only way forward because the fate of \r\nmillions of men, women and children depends on our \r\njoint efforts.\r\nI believe that the best way we can pay tribute to \r\nMandela is to follow his path for the future and for \r\nhope — a path of permanent dialogue among continents \r\nand civilizations, of the inseparable freedom of a \r\nglobalized human family, of love for others.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia.\r\nMr. Kalla (Indonesia): Today we celebrate the \r\nlegacy of the late President Nelson Mandela and the \r\nmany ways in which he continues to inspire us — not \r\nonly his fellow South Africans, but also people from \r\nvarious corners of the world. I was fortunate to \r\nmeet him in 2003. I remember him as a person with \r\na calm character — a modest figure, but with strong \r\nconvictions. I also remember fondly his beloved, \r\ncolourful batik shirt, which reflected his vibrant spirit.\r\nNelson Mandela taught us the values of justice and \r\nreconciliation. His struggle against apartheid showed \r\nus what it means to free ourselves from discrimination \r\nand to respect human rights and dignity, regardless of \r\nthe differences in our skin colour, faith, nationality or \r\nsocial status. Those are values that transcend borders. \r\nDemocracy will succeed when there is peace, respect \r\nfor differences and tolerance. Peace and stability are \r\nimportant preconditions for progress and development.\r\nI am a believer in the value of reconciliation. One \r\nexample is how well the reconciliation process has \r\nworked in Aceh. Peace in Aceh has allowed for steady \r\neconomic development, and former rebels now hold \r\nimportant Government positions.\r\nJustice and reconciliation were also sought at the \r\nregional and international levels. Indonesia’s present-\r\nday relationship with Timor-Leste is a model for \r\npost-conflict relations based on those values. Our \r\ngood-neighbourly relations continue to strengthen the \r\nforward-looking relationship between our two countries \r\nand peoples.\r\nWe understand that peace is a prerequisite for \r\ndevelopment and that development would be impossible \r\nor unsustainable without peace. In order for development \r\nto be sustainable, it must be fair, both within and among \r\nsocieties. Therefore, the United Nations and all its \r\nentities should continue to promote and ensure global \r\npeace, as well as equitable and sustainable development \r\nfor all its Members. No one can be left behind.\r\nWe believe that a habit of dialogue nurtures a culture \r\nof peace. It underpins good relations among nations, \r\ntolerance among creeds and religions, and the alliance \r\nof civilizations. We also believe that dialogue can help \r\ntackle hate speech, radicalism and violent extremism.\r\nMr. Sánchez (Spain), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nAs a true partner for peace, Indonesia is committed \r\nto waging peace, which includes prevention, avoiding a \r\nrelapse into conflict, and post-conflict peacebuilding. \r\nLet us take the life and legacy of Nelson Mandela \r\nas an example and set to work together on issues of \r\ncommon concern.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to Her Excellency Ms. Epsy Campbell \r\nBarr, Vice-President of the Republic of Costa Rica.\r\nMs. Campbell Barr (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nNelson Mandela once said that he was just a common \r\nman who became a leader owing to extraordinary \r\ncircumstances. That is the call that we make to those in \r\nleadership positions. Those are the words of one of the \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 19/86\r\ngreatest leaders of our times, a man who transcended \r\nhis circumstances and put the freedom of his people \r\nabove his own freedom.\r\nThis Peace Summit is an extraordinary opportunity \r\nto pay tribute to Nelson Mandela. I welcome this \r\nmeeting, as it allows States to consider the challenge of \r\npeace, as peace is the basis for ensuring the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of our societies. It is an opportunity, \r\nbefore the opening of the general debate of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session, to reflect upon \r\nand recognize the legacy of one of the most emblematic \r\nand important figures of our times and to reflect on \r\nthe ideals upon which he based his life and which \r\nhe so ardently defended. Mandela will always be a \r\nbeacon for his courage and for his emotional and moral \r\nfortitude, and above all for the great challenges he \r\nfaced owing to his convictions and in defence of his \r\nown principles. Those convictions must become our \r\nsource of inspiration in our fight for a world of equality, \r\nfreedom and equal opportunities for men and women, \r\nwhere there is neither racism nor discrimination.\r\nThe legacy of Nelson Mandela should become an \r\neven stronger foundation for building peace, dialogue \r\nand democracy, where national reconciliation and \r\nhuman rights are central elements. When peace \r\nbreaks down in various parts of the world, we must \r\nstrengthen multilateralism and follow the teachings of \r\nNelson Mandela with regard to dialogue, negotiation, \r\nrespect, humility and solidarity among peoples and \r\nnations. As peoples, as nations and as the international \r\ncommunity, we must find the way to transcend our own \r\ncircumstances so as to ensure the greatest good for \r\nour nations — as Mandela did — and build societies \r\nbased on tolerance, reconciliation and dialogue. In that \r\nmanner we can eliminate injustice, oppression, racism \r\nand discrimination.\r\nToday we join in this celebration of Nelson \r\nMandela’s life and legacy with the hope that we can \r\nbecome living examples of his legacy. I make a call for \r\npeace so that our brother Republic of Nicaragua can \r\ncreate the necessary conditions to emerge from its crisis \r\nthrough respectful and tolerant dialogue and respect for \r\nthe human rights of all people. It is our responsibility to \r\nbring about a just, free and peaceful world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of \r\nCanada.\r\nMr. Trudeau (Canada): Nelson Mandela’s message \r\nof peace was rooted in the conviction that we are all \r\npart of the same community, that our fate is tied to that \r\nof our fellow citizens. He famously held that\r\n“to be free is not merely to cast off one’s chains, \r\nbut to live in a way that respects and enhances the \r\nfreedom of others”.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nNamed an honorary Canadian citizen in 2001, \r\nNelson Mandela touched the lives of millions of \r\npeople, transcending time and place. Our former \r\nPrime Ministers Mulroney and Clark are among the \r\nCanadians who were firmly opposed to the apartheid \r\nregime and pressured world leaders and leaders of \r\nmultilateral organization to take the same stance. I also \r\nrecall the deep impact that Mandela had on my father, \r\nwho admired his character and his fight for peace. They \r\nspoke about those topics at length when they met in \r\nthe 1990s.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFrom the dock of the defendant to the confines of \r\nRobben Island to the f loor of the United Nations, Nelson \r\nMandela always appealed to our common humanity. \r\nThat must be the foundation of any lasting peace. One \r\nhundred years after his birth, it is fitting that Madiba be \r\nremembered here by leaders of all nations.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIt is fitting that he be remembered by leaders who \r\nrecognize that they share the same challenges and \r\nwho, despite their differences, share the same hopes \r\nand dreams of peace, prosperity and possibilities for \r\ntheir citizens.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThat is not to say that our solidarity is unquestioned \r\nor unshaken. Armed conflict, emerging threats and \r\na changing climate have all tested the strength of \r\nour commitment and the bounds of our compassion. \r\nAt times like these, we must remember the example \r\nof Nelson Mandela, who believed that we should not \r\ndespair — for our troubles only bear witness to a \r\njob unfinished.\r\nAs we pay tribute to the legacy of Nelson Mandela, \r\nCanada reaffirms its resolve to push forward the work \r\nthat he began. Canada will continue to call out the \r\nunfair treatment of racial and ethnic minorities, women \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n20/86 18-29599\r\nand girls, and indigenous peoples. We will continue to \r\nspeak up for the Rohingyan refugees, for the Yazidis of \r\nnorthern Iraq, and for the people of Venezuela. Canada \r\nwill always stand tall for democracy, the rule of law \r\nand human rights at home and abroad. Peace is the \r\nwork of many generations. Madiba took up the cause of \r\npeace, and it is now up to us to keep carrying the torch \r\nforward. The f lames of his ideals must live on in each \r\nand every one of us.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chief Executive of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Abdullah (Afghanistan): It is a distinct honour \r\nfor me and the Afghan delegation to attend the Nelson \r\nMandela Peace Summit today as we begin the work of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-third session. We \r\nare gathered here today to honour the centenary of the \r\nbirth of the late Nelson Mandela, one of the world’s most \r\nimpressive and dedicated defenders of freedom, liberty \r\nand human rights, indeed a symbol of those values.\r\nHowever, this Summit goes beyond remembrance \r\nand celebration. It is an occasion for addressing the real \r\nchallenges and dire conditions faced by human beings \r\nwho are being victimized in communities around the \r\nworld. It is a reminder that we have not only moral and \r\nlegal obligations to protect and defend, but also another \r\nopportunity to renew our commitment to peace, \r\nconflict prevention and resolution, reconciliation, \r\nnon-discrimination and the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights. We are all painfully aware of the agony \r\nand injustice faced by millions around our planet, \r\nsome as victims of indiscriminate violence, of which \r\nterrorism is one particular form.\r\nI am here today representing a country and a \r\nsociety that has undergone almost 40 years of conflict \r\nand has suffered mainly as a result of external strife, \r\nprimarily imposed on us against our people’s majority \r\nwill and wishes. Almost every theme and core issue \r\naddressed by the Summit matches conditions faced by \r\nAfghanistan and the impact that such conditions have \r\nhad on three generations of Afghans.\r\nIt is therefore befitting and of critical importance \r\nto me and my compatriots to focus on concepts \r\nsuch as reconciliation aimed at attaining a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace. The renewal of our commitment \r\nneeds to go beyond rhetoric and empty pledges. We need \r\nto translate them into results-oriented engagement, \r\ndialogue, negotiations, strategy and policy changes and \r\nreforms that lead to sustainable and fair solutions. That \r\nis what we have aimed to do in Afghanistan for the past \r\nfew years.\r\nWe value the steadfast resolve of our security \r\nforces to fight terrorism, as well as the general support \r\nof our international friends who stand by those shared \r\ngoals. Our message has been clear: we will defend our \r\ncountry and our people’s lives and rights as part of the \r\nconstitutional order, but we stand ready to talk and \r\nnegotiate with armed groups amenable to reconciliation, \r\nas well as with armed opposition forces that renounce \r\nviolence and terror and believe in a united, democratic, \r\npeaceful and economically prosperous future.\r\nI believe that this is the spirit conveyed by such \r\ninspiring global role models as Nelson Mandela, and \r\nI believe that it is part of the legacy that this body and \r\neach country carries as part of their commitments and \r\nresponsibilities. I wish us success in bringing the vision \r\nfor peace and human rights to life across the globe.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Boyko Borissov, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Bulgaria.\r\nMr. Borissov (Bulgaria) (spoke in Bulgarian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): It is a great \r\nprivilege for me to take part in this important event \r\nmarking the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. \r\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Bulgaria, \r\nas well as on my own behalf, let me express our sincere \r\nadmiration for his legacy.\r\nThe challenges that we are all facing today demand \r\nthat we never forget the values that Nelson Mandela \r\navidly fought for, namely, peace, tolerance, democracy \r\nand respect for human rights for all. It is necessary to \r\nreaffirm the principles of multilateralism, as today’s \r\nchallenges can be overcome only if all countries \r\nwork together.\r\nNelson Mandela taught us that the brave are not \r\nafraid to forgive in the name of peace. It is exactly \r\nthat type of valour that we, the leaders of today, who \r\nhave the task and bear the responsibility of making this \r\nworld a better place, need to demonstrate — a world \r\nof shared opportunities, shared prosperity and shared \r\nresponsibilities; a world in which all our differences \r\ncoexist in harmony.\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 21/86\r\nNelson Mandela remains forever as a glowing \r\nsymbol in human history of the drive of the peoples of \r\nAfrica, as well as all other peoples around the world, for \r\nfreedom, peace, development and prosperity. His cause \r\nprovoked an avalanche of events and changes that led \r\nto the establishment of a new paradigm of thinking and \r\nrelations based on the defence of human rights, together \r\nwith the goal of ensuring social justice, development \r\nand reconciliation.\r\nThis remarkable anniversary compels me to \r\nshare a few additional thoughts. When we talk about \r\nsocial justice and development here at the United \r\nNations, we cannot but mention the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. Achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, which are universal in nature but \r\nclosely interdependent, is the key to tackling the global \r\nchallenges of today.\r\nIn the first half of this year, the Bulgarian presidency \r\nof the Council of the European Union made significant \r\nefforts to achieve progress and consensus among the \r\nmember States on the main domains in this area. We \r\nare proud that, during that period, the mandate of the \r\nEuropean Union for the commencement of negotiations \r\nfor the conclusion of a new partnership agreement \r\nwith the 79 countries of Africa, the Caribbean and \r\nthe Pacific was endorsed. The negotiations aim to \r\nestablish a modern and dynamic partnership with \r\nthose countries as an important instrument for tackling \r\nglobal challenges, namely, the fight against poverty and \r\ninequality, and the nourishing of peace, security and \r\nsustainable growth for all.\r\nThis is also the place to take up the commitment \r\nto redoubling our efforts aimed at eliminating violence \r\nbased on gender, religion or ethnicity, our struggle \r\nfor the empowerment of women and youth, who are \r\nthe future of our planet. Only by providing equal \r\nopportunities for all can prosperity be achieved.\r\nAs I pay my utmost respects to the political, \r\nhuman and spiritual legacy of the extraordinary Nelson \r\nMandela, I would like to express my own highest regard \r\nand that of the people of Bulgaria for his ideals of \r\nfreedom, equality and justice in relations among people \r\naround the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Nikol Pashinyan, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Armenia.\r\nMr. Pashinyan (Armenia): It is a great a honour \r\nto address the General Assembly on the occasion of \r\nthe Nelson Mandela Peace Summit, which marks the \r\ncentennial anniversary of that iconic political leader’s \r\nbirth. Mandela’s image symbolizes peace and human \r\ndignity, while at the same time embodying the ideals of \r\nstruggle and compassion. His name is deeply rooted in \r\nour collective memory as a pioneer in the fight against \r\nracism and discrimination and as a strong advocate for \r\njustice and equality.\r\nIt was only half a year ago that the people of \r\nArmenia rejected fear and injustice and took to the \r\nstreets to protest for their fundamental rights, freedom \r\nand dignity. As dramatic events were unfolding in \r\nthe streets of Yerevan, I was asked if I had a model \r\nof a leader who inspired me in my national striving \r\nfor democracy and social justice, and my answer was: \r\n“Yes, there is such a leader, and that leader is Nelson \r\nMandela”. Having been a political prisoner myself, I \r\nclosely followed the political and life story of that most \r\nfamous political prisoner, who would in the end change \r\nhis own country and the aspirations of millions of \r\npeople worldwide. As Mandela said on one occasion,\r\n“I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, \r\nbut the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who \r\ndoes not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear”.\r\nMandala’s book Long Walk to Freedom was \r\nwith me during my imprisonment. It influenced my \r\nconscience to a great extent and motivated me to \r\nembark upon my own long walk to freedom through \r\nimprisonment, persecution and the struggle against \r\ninjustice throughout the towns and villages of my \r\ncountry. In the true spirit of Mandela’s ideals, our \r\nmovement became known to the world as the Armenian \r\nnon-violent velvet revolution of love and solidarity. \r\nNow, months after our people’s success, I stand here \r\nat the high rostrum of this Summit, as the Head of a \r\nmodern Armenian Government, to celebrate the legacy \r\nof that great person, whose courage and determination \r\nserve as an example for others around the globe.\r\nI come from a region where, unfortunately, bloody \r\nconflicts, corrupt systems of governance and animosity \r\namong people often overshadow wisdom and the need \r\nfor peaceful coexistence. It is said that democracies \r\ndo not wage war against one another, and I hope that \r\none day our region’s democratic development will rule \r\nout the risk of hostilities, wars and hatred. Armenia \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n22/86 18-29599\r\nhas firmly embarked upon that path and unwaveringly \r\nstands for regional peace, stability and reconciliation.\r\nThis Summit provides us with yet another \r\nopportunity to reflect upon the reasons that humankind \r\nis not yet immune to the scourge of discrimination, \r\nintolerance, xenophobia, persecution and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. The life and struggle of Nelson \r\nMandela will stand as a true model of what should and \r\ncan be done, as he preached that no one is born hating \r\nothers, and if one can learn to hate, one can be taught \r\nto love. Therefore, the mission of the world’s leaders is \r\nto learn and teach their people how to love. That will be \r\nthe greatest tribute to Mandela’s memory.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Erna Solberg, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Norway.\r\nMs. Solberg (Norway): It is an honour for me to \r\nbe here today to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela’s vision \r\nand political leadership. I stand in this Hall as Prime \r\nMinister of Norway with the values that I express today \r\non behalf of all five Nordic countries — Denmark, \r\nFinland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.\r\nMandela’s dedication to peace, equality and justice \r\nhas been an inspiration to the world. Nelson Mandela \r\ntaught us two important lessons about sustainable \r\npeace: the importance of truth and reconciliation and \r\nthe importance of inclusion. It has been 25 years since \r\nthe Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian \r\nLiberation Organization were signed in Washington, \r\nD.C. The end of the Cold War had created new hope \r\nfor the future. We saw an opportunity for the mediated \r\nresolution of armed conflicts. That marked the beginning \r\nof the Nordic engagement in conflict resolution. It has \r\nsince become a cornerstone of Norwegian and Nordic \r\nforeign policy. For more than 25 years, all the Nordic \r\ncountries have engaged in efforts to resolve conflicts \r\naround the world. We have learned an important lesson \r\nfrom that: negotiating a peace agreement is always \r\ndifficult, but implementing an agreement is even \r\nharder. In fact, few peace agreements are ever fully \r\nimplemented. Sixty per cent of all conflicts recur, and \r\nsince the mid-1990s conflict recurrence has become \r\nmore common than the onset of new conflicts. That \r\nmeans that the best way to prevent conflict is to ensure \r\nthat peace is sustainable.\r\nConflict resolution is not a quick fix. It requires \r\nbold leadership from all the parties involved. During \r\nhis Nobel Peace Prize lecture in Oslo, Nelson Mandela \r\nemphasized the importance of public participation in \r\npeace processes. That principle is just as important \r\ntoday, and a key component of public participation is the \r\nparticipation of women. Ownership is also vital to the \r\nsustainability of every peace process. Nelson Mandela \r\nalso showed us that we cannot ignore the past; we have \r\nto confront it with the truth. Truth and reconciliation \r\nare key to ending conflict and preventing further \r\nconflict. Norway and the Nordic countries will continue \r\nto be inspired by Mandela’s ideals in our peace efforts \r\naround the world, and we will continue to support the \r\nSecretary-General in his sustainable peace agenda and \r\nin efforts to ensure inclusive peace processes.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Malta.\r\nMr. Muscat (Malta): It is a privilege to have the \r\nopportunity to celebrate the centenary of the birth of \r\nNelson Mandela here with everyone today. We are \r\npaying tribute not only to a person, but also to the \r\nvalues that he embodied, that is, reconciliation over \r\nrevenge, cooperation over conflict and hope over hate. \r\nIt is in that spirit of cooperation that we must grapple \r\nwith the emerging challenges that are already adding \r\nto existing economic pressures and political tensions \r\nworldwide. Whether with regard to climate change \r\nor migration, our ability to effect change will depend \r\nupon our capacity to mobilize our resources to address \r\nunderlying causes. By shifting our efforts towards \r\nsustainable development, conflict resolution and \r\npeacebuilding, we can try to prevent wars and alleviate \r\npoverty, a blight that dispossesses millions of people. \r\nIn the near future, shifts in the risk of extreme weather \r\nwill become an additional factor that will compel people \r\nto f lee their homes and abandon their communities.\r\nMy country, Malta, has always maintained \r\nthat we are greater than the sum of our individual \r\ninterests. Initiatives such as the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change continue to provide reason for \r\noptimism. That strong sign of unity should also be \r\nvisible in our approach to the exodus of refugees and \r\nmigrants — a phenomenon that we need to manage. \r\nThe European Union-Africa Valletta Summit reflected \r\nour commitment to a multilateral approach aimed at \r\ndelivering a holistic plan. Going forward, our ability to \r\nstrive towards the collective good will serve as a litmus \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 23/86\r\ntest of our belief in the values of Nelson Mandela, which \r\nwe are celebrating today.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Andrew Holness, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister of Defence, Economic Growth and Job \r\nCreation of Jamaica.\r\nMr. Holness (Jamaica): I commend the \r\nUnited Nations — the greatest global peace \r\nalliance — for convening the Nelson Mandela Peace \r\nSummit in commemoration of the centenary of that \r\ngreat man’s birth.\r\nJamaica is proud of the strong leadership role that \r\nit played in driving efforts to dismantle the apartheid \r\nsystem in South Africa. Under that system, Nelson \r\nMandela was unjustly incarcerated for 27 years, and \r\nmillions of Africans were oppressed. We were the first \r\ncountry in the western hemisphere and the second in \r\nthe world, together with India, to ban trade and travel \r\nwith the racist regime. Jamaica’s support for the fight \r\nagainst racial injustice in South Africa preceded the \r\nofficial advent of the apartheid system. Over many \r\nyears, with support from countries all around the globe, \r\nmany Jamaicans, including academics, politicians, \r\nclergy and iconic artists, such as our own reggae \r\nlegend and freedom fighter Bob Marley, and people \r\nfrom all walks of life joined together in the clarion call \r\n“Free Mandela”.\r\nIt is in that context that I am deeply honoured to \r\nparticipate in this Summit, which comes at a time of \r\nheightened global concern about hostility and conflict \r\nwithin some of our societies, with some regimes focused \r\non the use of might rather than the protection of right. \r\nThe centenary of Nelson Mandela’s birth provides \r\nus with space as world leaders to affirm the need for \r\nhealthy and meaningful dialogue to engender peace, \r\nreconciliation and communal accord. Those, I believe, \r\nare principles that Mandela would very much wish us \r\nto promote on this occasion. Admittedly, those goals \r\nare not easily achieved without significant sacrifice on \r\nthe part of leaders. No one understood that better than \r\nNelson Mandela. He asserted that real leaders must be \r\nready to sacrifice all for the freedom of their people. \r\nThat was his mantra and sacrifice, to which he held and \r\nwhich guided his actions. Nelson Mandela understood, \r\nhowever, throughout his long walk to freedom, that full \r\nfreedom could be achieved only if he left bitterness \r\nbehind. In that regard, he stated,\r\n“What counts is not the mere fact that we lived. \r\nIt is what difference we have made to the lives of \r\nothers that will determine the significance of the \r\nlife we lead”.\r\nLike Mandela, we too must commit to the consolidation \r\nof peaceful coalitions. What better occasion than this \r\nSummit to do just that? Let that be our legacy in \r\nhis honour.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jüri Ratas, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia.\r\nMr. Ratas (Estonia): It is my honour to speak \r\nhere today about the legacy of Nelson Mandela and his \r\noutstanding service to humankind. That legacy is an \r\nexample for all of us, as well as for future generations. \r\nHis endless fight for peace, human rights and \r\ndemocracy permanently changed how we live today. \r\nHis self-sacrificing aspirations for African freedom \r\nhave inspired many. Nelson Mandela said that the sight \r\nof freedom looming on the horizon should encourage us \r\nto redouble our efforts.\r\nLikewise, in 1990, Estonia was on the path to \r\nregain the most precious thing: its freedom. We \r\nsincerely appreciate Nelson Mandela’s dedication to, \r\nand persistence in, bringing about freedom and justice, \r\nbecause Estonians know very well the price of peace \r\nand independence. We welcome the adoption of the \r\nNelson Mandela political declaration (resolution 73/1), \r\nwhich calls for the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace. \r\nThat will take forward the work begun by the African \r\nUnion under Nelson Mandela’s decade of reconciliation \r\nin Africa. Peaceful solutions and preventive actions \r\nare the most effective way to avoid the escalation \r\nof disputes.\r\nEstonia calls for the involvement of all actors, \r\nincluding women and young people, in resolving disputes \r\nin a peaceful manner. We find that reaching a peaceful \r\noutcome through negotiations and compromises is \r\nalways the preferable path for achieving sustainable \r\nsolutions. Estonia believes that every person in the \r\nworld should live in dignity. We continue to promote \r\nfreedom, equality and prosperity. However, we should \r\nbe reminded that we are standing at a crossroads. Once \r\nagain the disputes today and the challenges of past \r\ndecades are threatening the world in which we live and \r\nour shared values. It is our decision as to which path we \r\nchoose. The choice is between a world of alienation and \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n24/86 18-29599\r\nhatred or one of unity and prosperity. Looking back at \r\nthe lifelong struggle of Nelson Mandela, who provided \r\nan example for our own aspirations for independence, \r\nwe should keep in mind that positive changes can never \r\nbe taken for granted.\r\nIn conclusion, as part of the United Nations, we are \r\nreminded everyday of the importance of human rights \r\nas a bridge to freedom in providing us with a vision in \r\nour work for achieving justice, freedom and dignity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ralph E. Gonsalves, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister for Finance, the Public Service, National \r\nSecurity, Legal Affairs and Grenadines Affairs of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines.\r\nMr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is situated in what has \r\nbeen called a zone of peace, and we owe our continued \r\npeaceful existence to a robust body of international law \r\nand the United Nations. But it was not always so. The \r\ngenocide of all native peoples by the colonial Powers \r\nand the atrocity of slavery brought conflict to our \r\nidyllic shores, and today we continue to grapple with \r\nthose legacies of colonialism. It is that very history, \r\nthe human tragedy and the quest for the ennoblement \r\nof humankind that connects us to Nelson Mandela. In \r\ncelebration of the centennial of his birth in July, my \r\nGovernment renamed the South Leeward Highway in \r\nSaint Vincent in his honour.\r\nMandela fought for all peoples, not just South \r\nAfricans. He led his people’s dismantling of the \r\ncolonial pyramids of oppression and racism, and he \r\nled the African National Congress in its mission to end \r\napartheid and establish an integrated nation of peace, \r\njustice, equality and democracy devoid of vengeful \r\nvendettas. There are attempts today to excise swaths \r\nof history from our collective memory and change the \r\nnarrative after the fact to one of the alleged successful \r\nconstructive engagements of yesteryear by the same \r\nPowers that labelled Mandela a terrorist. But they \r\ncannot do that. We remember.\r\nNow the stone that those so-called builders rejected \r\nhas become the cornerstone. We can now all gather at \r\nthe United Nations, including the former naysayers, to \r\nrecognize that peace icon together. Mandela’s legacy \r\ntells us to stop grinding old axes and start creating \r\nalliances. He tells us that we might have been separated \r\nbefore, but now we are together. His life shows us how \r\nan enemy and so-called threat to global peace today \r\ncan be a friend tomorrow. Mandela believed that there \r\ncannot be peace without equality. He stood up against \r\nunilateralism and nationalism in favour of dialogue. He \r\ntold us that we must do more to live up to those ideals, \r\nwhich have been captured in the political declaration \r\n(resolution 73/1), which we adopted today. As we join \r\nin the universal remembrance of Nelson Mandela, 100 \r\nyears after his birth, let us memorialize him with a \r\nrenewed commitment to sustaining peace globally.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, and National \r\nSecurity and Intelligence of New Zealand.\r\nMs. Ardern (New Zealand): I am honoured to be \r\nhere to mark the legacy of Nelson Mandela and the 100th \r\nyear since his birth. Nelson Mandela was a global icon \r\nfor the fight for equality, freedom and human rights. \r\nNot only did he lead the struggle against apartheid and \r\ndivision, but he personified the values of forgiveness \r\nand reconciliation. When I say that his impact was \r\nglobal, I mean just that. Nelson Mandela had a profound \r\nimpact on New Zealand. His struggle against apartheid \r\nwas supported in New Zealand through a mass protest \r\nmovement, which opposed sporting contacts between \r\nour countries, particularly the Springboks and the \r\nAll Blacks, culminating in major protest events in the \r\nearly 1980s.\r\nMy father missed my first birthday because of \r\nit. He was a policeman and was called upon to work \r\nduring the protests that surrounded that tour. The 1981 \r\nSpringbok tour protests were a lesson in solidarity and \r\nits impact. When Madiba visited New Zealand in 1995 \r\nas the elected President of South Africa, he described \r\nthe news of the protest action in New Zealand in the \r\n1980s as the sun coming out. I remember that 1995 \r\nvisit, his dignity and his inspiration. Mandela was \r\na living embodiment of United Nations values. It is \r\nthose values and Mandela’s moral example that we \r\nseek to promote in a world that is more fragmented and \r\nfractured than ever — an example that calls for justice, \r\npeace and forgiveness.\r\nFor many New Zealanders our most vivid memory \r\nof Mandela was his appearance on the field following \r\nSouth Africa’s 1995 Rugby World Cup victory over \r\nNew Zealand, while donning a Springbok jersey \r\nand presenting the trophy to the South African team \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 25/86\r\ncaptain. That was a seminal moment. If Mandela could \r\nmake peace, so could the rest of South Africa. That one \r\nact of both triumph and reconciliation said much about \r\nwho Nelson Mandela was, his capacity to forgive, his \r\ncommitment to reconciliation and his ability to lead \r\nand inspire against all odds.\r\nIt is to those same values of promoting peace \r\nthat we committed ourselves to when we signed the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We collectively bound \r\nourselves to the settlement of disputes and diplomacy. \r\nThat means that, when we see a worsening security \r\nsituation, we act. For too long the United Nations and \r\nthe international community have waited to react. \r\nInstead, we must be proactive and place greater focus \r\non conflict prevention. We must get better at identifying \r\nhigh-risk situations and warning signs before conflict \r\nbegins. We must not be silent in the face of intolerance, \r\nhate and discrimination. We must speak for those who \r\ndo not have a voice. We must pursue equal rights for all.\r\nLet us today remember Mandela and the values \r\nhe devoted his life to on his long walk to freedom, but \r\nlet us also not forget the work that remains to be done. \r\nWe must ensure that the just, peaceful, prosperous, \r\ndemocratic and inclusive world for which Mandela \r\nstrove is fully realized. New Zealand’s commitment to \r\nthat work remains unwavering. Above all else, Madiba \r\ntaught us that, whatever the issue — whether it concern \r\nracism, inequity or insurmountable differences — none \r\nof us is too small or too far away to be relevant in the \r\ncollective struggle for justice. As we remember Madiba, \r\nmy hope is that we all will give a reason for the sun to \r\ncome out.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mamuka Bakhtadze, Prime Minister of \r\nGeorgia.\r\nMr. Bakhtadze (Georgia): It is an honour for me to \r\nbe here today to address this audience. The centenary \r\nof the birth of Nelson Mandela is a great opportunity \r\nto celebrate his great achievements, and, for most \r\nof us, it is an opportunity to reflect on the universal \r\nvalues of peace, humanity, diversity and reconciliation \r\nthat guided him and inspired millions. We must admit \r\nthat the world of today is falling increasingly behind \r\nin terms of adhering to Mandela’s legacy. We continue \r\nto fall victim to unresolved armed conflicts, the threat \r\nof terrorism, grave human rights abuses and numerous \r\nforms of discrimination and inequality throughout the \r\nworld. In these challenging times, our efforts should \r\nbe directed towards investing in multilateralism, \r\nsustaining peace and building inclusive, diverse \r\nsocieties that stand on the pillars of democracy, human \r\nrights and the rule of law.\r\nNone cherish peace more than those who have \r\nexperienced its absence. Peace in my country, Georgia, \r\nhas been challenged by the ongoing conflict with the \r\nRussian Federation. That conflict, which dates back to \r\nthe early 1990s, has affected hundreds of thousands of \r\npeople, including those who had to f lee their homes and \r\nremain unable to return, as well as those few who remain \r\nin the occupied territories and are sealed off from the \r\nrest of the world, while facing ethnic discrimination \r\nand grave human rights violations. In the twenty-first \r\ncentury, we continue to witness the installation of \r\nrazor- and barbed-wire fences, which divide families \r\nand cut people off from their livelihoods. All of that \r\nsharply contrasts with the vision and ideals that Nelson \r\nMandela fought for. Despite the existential challenges \r\nthat we face today, our response to the aggression has \r\ninvolved constructive engagement and negotiations \r\naimed at the peaceful resolution of the conflict. As \r\nNelson Mandela said, “The common ground is greater \r\nand more enduring than the differences that divide”.\r\nWe are determined to reach out to our fellow \r\ncitizens residing on the other side of the occupation \r\nline and bridge the divides so as to build a common, \r\nprosperous future for our nation. With that in mind, \r\nin April, the Government of Georgia launched an \r\nimportant peace initiative, entitled “A step towards a \r\nbetter future”. Through that initiative, we are taking \r\nconcrete steps towards improving the humanitarian, \r\nsocial and economic conditions of the conflict-\r\naffected population.\r\nIt is time that we collectively raise our voices and \r\njoin efforts aimed at restoring a rules-based order and \r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nThose values cannot be taken for granted. We owe it to \r\nfuture generations to ensure that they live in peaceful \r\nand inclusive societies. Nelson Mandela’s fight for \r\nprogress, justice and equality should guide us on that \r\nroad. As he once famously said, “It always seems \r\nimpossible until it is done”.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Duško Marković, Prime Minister of \r\nMontenegro.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n26/86 18-29599\r\nMr. Marković (Montenegro) (spoke in \r\nMontenegrin; English interpretation provided by the \r\ndelegation): It is a particular honour for me to be able \r\nto address the General Assembly at this Summit named \r\nafter one of the genuine heroes of modern times. He \r\nwas a man who faced some of the gravest challenges \r\nfollowing the Second World War and yet found the \r\nrequired courage and wisdom to make the modern \r\nworld a better place in which to live. By preserving the \r\nmemory of the fearless spirit of Nelson Mandela — a \r\nunique symbol of the struggle against apartheid and \r\ndiscrimination — humankind is fulfilling its obligation \r\nto safeguard the future based on the foundations laid by \r\nMandela in his committed struggle for the liberation and \r\nprosperity of South Africa, the modern culmination of \r\nwhich was based on values conducive to the prosperity \r\nof all of humankind. It is to those values in particular \r\nthat we should dedicate ourselves in order to make the \r\nworld a better place. The challenges of today’s world \r\nare becoming increasingly complex, while bringing \r\nabout divisions within it that could undermine the \r\noverall progress already made.\r\nI believe that it is only through a joint and unified \r\nresponse and by reinforcing multilateralism, a synonym \r\nfor agreement among peoples and nations, that we can \r\nensure forward progress. In order to accomplish that \r\ngoal, we need an efficient and effective United Nations \r\nthat promotes the sacred values of human rights, \r\nequality and peace, thus serving as a stable anchor for \r\nall of our aspirations. Based on the foundation of Nelson \r\nMandela’s legacy, global differences and disparities can \r\nbe transformed into an environment where civil values \r\nare preserved and cherished, enabling a better future \r\nfor the generations to come.\r\nThe region that I come from is well known for \r\na proverb that says that our region absorbs history. \r\nUnfortunately, we have witnessed many conflicts. But \r\nwe in Montenegro have also managed to find the inner \r\nstrength to overcome the consequences of lost years \r\nthrough mediation. Montenegro is one of six countries \r\nthat emerged following the dissolution of the former \r\nYugoslavia, and despite the challenges it has faced, it \r\nhas preserved its internal stability.\r\nWe proudly point out that during the 1990s we \r\nopened our borders to hundreds of thousands of \r\nrefugees and displaced persons, which was quite a \r\nnatural choice for our multi-ethnic, multi-religious \r\nand tolerant community. Based on the foundation of \r\nintertwined religions, cultures and nations, we restored \r\nour independence precisely 109 years after our first \r\npeacekeeping mission. It is my particular honour \r\ntoday at the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit to have \r\nthe opportunity to recall the Montenegrin soldiers who \r\nwere deployed on the island of Crete to mediate between \r\nthe Cretans and the Greeks on 11 January 1897, paving \r\nthe way for the Blue Helmets of the United Nations. \r\nThose 70 soldiers and nine officers made our country \r\nproud for many years. My main reason for recalling this \r\nfact is to pay tribute to all the brave men and women \r\nwho are today risking their lives under the blue f lag \r\nof the United Nations in order to help others and in \r\norder to preserve the values that we promote here on \r\nthe East River.\r\nI thank the membership for this opportunity to \r\nconvey the readiness of Montenegro to reaffirm its \r\ndecision to continue to contribute to peace and equality \r\namong people. The best beacon on that road is the work \r\nof Nelson Mandela. That is why I would like to wrap \r\nup by expressing my utmost respect for his legacy. I \r\nbelieve that it will forever remain an inspiration for the \r\ncurrent and future generations of the entire world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Itaukei Affairs, Sugar \r\nIndustry and Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Fiji.\r\nMr. Bainimarama (Fiji): Before I begin, I would \r\nlike also to congratulate the representatives of South \r\nAfrica and Ireland, Mr. Jerry Matjila and Ms. Geraldine \r\nByrne Nason, and all our representatives for their \r\ncommitment to this consultation process.\r\nMy fellow representatives have given full and \r\ninspiring accounts of the life of service that His \r\nExcellency Nelson Mandela lived and of the legacy \r\nthat he bequeathed to humanity: one of tolerance, \r\nreconciliation, equality and kindness. As a political \r\nactivist who went through 27 years of imprisonment, \r\nas a national leader, and finally as an international \r\nstatesman, he held firmly to his principles and acted \r\nwith supreme wisdom. Through his life and legacy, \r\nMadiba is an inspiration to all of us who strive to \r\nrespect and protect the human rights of all people.\r\nThat legacy should mean a great deal to every \r\nperson on our planet, but it holds a special meaning for \r\nthe nation and the people that I lead. That is because, \r\nlike South Africa, Fiji and the Fijian people suffered \r\nfor decades under ethnicity-based political and cultural \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 27/86\r\ndivisions that fuelled hatred and disunity among our \r\ncommunities. It is only in recent years that we have \r\nbegun to shed that legacy and unshackle ourselves from \r\nour difficult history of ethnic division. We have done \r\nthat through a strict and unrelenting adherence to the \r\nsame principles for which Madiba so nobly sacrificed \r\nhimself during his life in order to defend a commitment \r\nto equal opportunity, and common and equal citizenry. \r\nThose principles lie at the heart of Fiji’s constitution. \r\nIt is on that foundation that Fiji will realize its full \r\npotential as a nation. That is the late Nelson Mandela’s \r\nenduring gift to our country. As such, it is with the \r\ngreatest pride that I give my support to today’s political \r\ndeclaration, a pride that I know is shared by the Fijian \r\npeople, a people that stands together, united today like \r\nnever before in our history.\r\nThe journey of human progress is unending. Yes, \r\nwe still face a world aff licted by conflict, racism \r\nand intolerance. But Mandela showed us that we can \r\nalways forge common ground, even in the bleakest of \r\nsituations, and that we can always find understanding \r\nin the shared experiences of our common humanity. At \r\nhome, abroad and in every encounter and exchange, \r\nwe must engage with an open mind. We must strive for \r\nacceptance and understanding. We must also remain \r\ncommitted to peace and democratic ideas. That was \r\nMandela’s vision, and that is what is captured by the \r\nMandela Declaration.\r\nSometimes we have to make sacrifices in order \r\nto forge enduring and just solutions to long-standing \r\nproblems. Mandela knew that. In fact, that is how he \r\nlived his life. It is a truth that we in Fiji recognize as \r\nwell. That is why thousands of brave Fijians have served \r\non the front lines in conflict areas around the world as \r\nUnited Nations peacekeepers over the past 40 years. We \r\nare deeply proud of that legacy. We have been proud to \r\nmake such a large commitment to global peace for a \r\nnation of our size and population. And we are equally \r\nproud to lead the world in confronting some of the \r\ngreatest challenges facing humanity, such as climate \r\nchange and the degradation of our oceans and seas. We \r\nhave led those important campaigns as President of the \r\n2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference and \r\nco-Chair of the Ocean Conference.\r\nAs part of our commitment to the global human \r\nfamily, we have built bridges between nations, State \r\nand local Governments, civil society, business leaders \r\nand ordinary citizens to overcome what differences we \r\nmay have in order to realize common goals — a stated \r\nobjective in the Declaration. In that way and in so \r\nmany others, the Nelson Mandela political declaration \r\nand this Summit amplify our own national priorities \r\nand how we Fijians see ourselves in the world — as \r\nchampions of peace, able and willing to forge bonds \r\nacross the global stage and as committed partners in \r\nuplifting and protecting all people, irrespective of who \r\nthey are or where they may come from.\r\nWith those few words, I am pleased to support \r\ntodat’s political declaration on behalf of Fiji and to \r\ngive, along with other leaders here, my full support to \r\nensuring that we build a better, more peaceful, more \r\nequal and more inclusive world — a world that lives up \r\nto the example of the great Nelson Mandela.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Thomas Motsoahae Thabane, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Lesotho.\r\nMr. Thabane (Lesotho): It is a great privilege \r\nfor me to deliver remarks on this auspicious occasion \r\nmarking the centenary of the birth of Nelson Rolihlahla \r\nMandela. Indeed, it is befitting that this Summit \r\nis entitled the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit. The \r\ncontribution of Nelson Mandela to peace, freedom, \r\ndemocracy, peaceful conflict resolution and the \r\npromotion of human rights is unparalleled. The peace \r\nthat we enjoy today, in Africa and beyond, was earned \r\nthrough the sacrifices of brave and self less men and \r\nwomen, including of course Nelson Mandela.\r\nNelson Mandela is undoubtedly one of the greatest \r\nleaders and statesmen of our time. I stand before this \r\nbody today, bearing testimony, since my country had \r\noccasion to benefit from the wisdom of that great man \r\nin resolving our own internal conflicts. In 1998, when \r\nmy country was in great turmoil and had plunged into \r\ninternal strife, former President Mandela, through his \r\nunique and unifying leadership, skill and humanity, \r\nably negotiated a breakthrough by way of a peace \r\nsettlement amid very acrimonious disagreements.\r\nWe in Lesotho also witnessed at first hand the \r\nbrutality and suffering that the black people of South \r\nAfrica and their liberation leaders, including Nelson \r\nMandela, went through under the apartheid yoke. It \r\nwas through the leadership of former President Nelson \r\nMandela and other revolutionary leaders that the people \r\nof South Africa remained hopeful in the face of despair, \r\nand of course ultimately they defeated the enemy.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n28/86 18-29599\r\nMandela lived a courageous life, epitomized by \r\nresilience, forgiveness and commitment to a cause \r\nbigger than himself. He was a giant who, all in the quest \r\nfor peace, self lessly embraced challenges that seemed \r\nimpossible to many. In the context of the struggle for \r\nliberation by the black people in South Africa, he had \r\nthe following to say:\r\n“I cannot pinpoint a moment when I became \r\npoliticized, but a steady accumulation of a \r\nthousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand \r\nunremembered moments produced in me... a \r\nrebelliousness, a desire to fight the system that \r\nimprisoned my people”.\r\nToday, we can speak of a free and democratic South \r\nAfrica, thanks to the leadership of Nelson Mandela. \r\nMandela, and other liberation fighters across the globe \r\nhave done their part. However, there is still a lot more \r\nthat needs to be done. Today, humankind is suffering \r\nfrom multidimensional crises, such as terrorism, the \r\ndenial of human rights, economic intolerance, the \r\noppression of the weak, and many others. All of those \r\nfactors not only disturb the equilibrium of peace, but \r\npresent an indictment of us all as leaders.\r\nAs we honour Madiba in this Summit, I challenge \r\neach of us to individually and collectively take a page \r\nfrom his life. Let us resolve to emulate and continue the \r\nlegacy that he left by striving to have a positive effect \r\non others around us. Let us embrace the values that he \r\nchampioned, which include economic development, \r\nthe eradication of poverty and the struggle to create \r\na better life for humankind. Our commitment should \r\nbe to follow in his footsteps so as to make the world a \r\nplace where we can all live in peace and harmony.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of Government \r\nof the Principality of Andorra.\r\nMr. Martí Petit (Andorra) (spoke in French): \r\nFor those of my generation who entered politics 25 \r\nor 30 years ago, President Mandela was always a \r\nmodel to be followed. He was a true pillar of an era \r\nmarked by the processes of democratization, peace \r\nand optimism. Mandela, and like him Gandhi several \r\ndecades previously, helped us to restore our confidence \r\nin humankind, the power of language, the struggle \r\nfor peace and the ability to engender change. I am \r\nconvinced that one of the key contributions of Nelson \r\nMandela was to show us that peace should not remain \r\na mere concept or an isolated one. In the strict sense \r\nof the term, peace is defined as the simple absence \r\nof violence. However, Peace with a capital “P” is far \r\nmore than just an absence of violence. It means justice, \r\nreconciliation, inclusion and respect for human rights. \r\nPeace that is built on the basis of injustice, vengeance \r\nor exclusion cannot be true or sustainable peace.\r\nThe same goes for the concept of democracy. In \r\na strict sense, it simply means the election of those \r\nwho govern by the governed. But democracy in the \r\nbroader sense also means justice, opportunities for all \r\nand respect for fundamental rights. One of the major \r\nproblems that democratic regimes must face today is \r\nthe fact that democracy is gradually moving away from \r\nthe values that make it a more complete and stronger \r\nsystem. We are seeing non-liberal and authoritarian \r\ndemocracies appear across the world. Those are regimes \r\nin which those who govern are, to be sure, elected by \r\nthe governed; however, there is a failure on the part of \r\nthose who govern to respect the rights of those whom \r\nthey govern. Mandela taught us that a peace that gives \r\nrise to exclusion or misery cannot be a real peace, and \r\nthat an unfair or discriminatory democracy is not a true \r\ndemocracy. We must be able to apply the lessons of \r\nPresident Mandela to our efforts to build a fairer and \r\nmore inclusive world, because what is necessary at the \r\nlocal level is also and perhaps even more necessary at \r\nthe global level.\r\nThe Principality of Andorra is a country that has \r\nno army and that has enjoyed 740 years of peace and \r\nneutrality. We are a country with strong democratic \r\nroots. Like all free, democratic States, we must continue \r\nto work for inclusion, non-discrimination and justice. \r\nThe Secretary-General knows that he can count on \r\nAndorra in the work of strengthening our commitment \r\nto achieving sustainable peace and preventing and \r\nresolving conflicts, while respecting international law \r\nand promoting human rights. The values of President \r\nMandela are also the values of the United Nations; \r\nthey are, therefore, also the values of the Principality \r\nof Andorra.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Hubert Alexander Minnis, Prime \r\nMinister of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\r\nMr. Minnis (Bahamas): I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening the \r\nNelson Mandela Peace Summit in support of global \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 29/86\r\npeace. Amid the wars, conflicts, violence, injustice, \r\nhunger and bitter hatreds that stalk the global commons \r\ntoday, we find hope in the commemoration of the \r\ncentenary of the birth of a noble soul, whose witness \r\nto reconciliation and peace is an eternal wellspring \r\nfor humanity.\r\nPeace and justice are as indivisible as the bond \r\nof human dignity, which transcends race, creed, \r\nethnicity and every circumstance of birth amid the \r\nexuberant diversity of humanity. In 1985, the Eighth \r\nCommonwealth Heads of Government Meeting was \r\nheld in the Bahamas, hosted by the late Prime Minister \r\nSir Lynden Pindling, a leading figure in the struggle \r\nfor equality and majority rule in the Bahamas. The \r\nmeeting produced the Commonwealth Agreement on \r\nSouth Africa, also known as the Nassau Accord. The \r\nNassau Accord pressed for the then Government of \r\nSouth Africa to enter into negotiations with the black \r\nmajority to end apartheid. The Accord also called on \r\nSouth Africa to end the occupation of Namibia.\r\nThe struggle for peace and justice is universal. \r\nIn 2014, Sir Arthur Foulkes, our then Head of State, \r\npenned a letter to the students of the Bahamas, in which \r\nhe said that the attainment of majority rule was the \r\nsecond emancipation of the Bahamas in 1967:\r\n“That event removed the last psychological \r\nshackles from the minds of many; it shattered false \r\nnotions of superiority or inferiority; it created \r\nthe foundation upon which to build a society \r\nwith opportunity for all; it unleashed the hitherto \r\nbrutally suppressed but powerful entrepreneurial \r\ninstincts of a people. It freed many Bahamians \r\nfrom the fear of one another because of differences \r\nof colour or ethnic origin.”\r\nAs we reflect on the centenary of Nelson Mandela’s \r\nbirth, and the seventieth anniversary of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, the most enduring \r\nwitness and testimony that we may offer is in the extent \r\nof the courage we show, like that man of nobility and \r\ngrace who was prepared to give his life in the service \r\nof humanity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of the \r\nHellenic Republic.\r\nMr. Tsipras (Greece): I come from a country \r\nfar away from that of Nelson Mandela. Nevertheless, \r\nour civilization inspired the democratic ideals that \r\nhe fought for and was ready to risk his life for. In the \r\ncentury that has passed, it was Nelson Mandela who \r\ninspired those democratic ideals and kept them alive \r\nunder the most difficult conditions. Today, his vision \r\nand actions are more relevant than ever, as our efforts \r\nare facing existential challenges, namely, an increase \r\nin wars and conflicts, growing regional inequalities, \r\na strengthening of racism and the emergence of \r\nreligious fundamentalism.\r\nThe current state of affairs requires a leadership \r\nin the style of Mandela: a relentless fighter for \r\nindependence, peace and human rights and, at the same \r\ntime, a responsible leader and formidable diplomat \r\nwho was ready to make the compromises necessary \r\nto ensure the achievement of those goals. I think that \r\nwas his power. He was a fighter who had proved his \r\ncommitment to the rights of his people as he rose from \r\nthe radical left, engaged in the colonial struggle and \r\nendured the 27 years of his imprisonment. And yet \r\nhe became a statesman who transformed his anger \r\nand conviction into an unmatchable energy aimed at \r\nreconciliation, unity and peace.\r\nIf we can learn how to hate, we can learn how to love, \r\nMandela said. At a time when the political momentum \r\nis moving rapidly backwards, we must believe that \r\nwe can turn things around. Social progress and peace \r\nare not givens. They are earned through struggle and \r\ncompromise. My country, Greece, has gone through both \r\nover the past three difficult years. Now Greece is exiting \r\neconomic programmes of austerity, while protecting the \r\nmost vulnerable; consolidating citizenship rights for \r\nthe children of migrants; reinforcing the rights of the \r\nMuslim minority; protecting the rights of the lesbian, \r\ngay, bisexual and transgender community; managing \r\nunprecedented refugee f lows, while respecting human \r\nrights; and resolving such international differences as \r\nthe name issue with our neighbour to the north, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nI believe strongly that whether we are talking \r\nabout overcoming such conflicts as exist in Syria or \r\nthe Palestinian issue, achieving the United Nations \r\nMillennium Development Goals or supporting African \r\ndevelopment, Nelson Mandela’s example should \r\ninspire us today to do much better at the national and \r\ninternational levels.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n30/86 18-29599\r\nMr. Carl Greenidge, Vice-President and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana.\r\nMr. Greenidge (Guyana): Guyana commends the \r\norganizing of the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit. The \r\nSummit provides the international community with \r\nan opportunity to reflect on global peace in tribute to \r\nthe centennial celebration and legacy of the inimitable \r\nNelson Mandela.\r\nThe central organizing objective of the United \r\nNations, enshrined in its Charter, is that we the peoples \r\nresolve to save succeeding generations from the scourge \r\nof war. It is therefore both timely and appropriate, \r\nas world leaders gather for the current session of \r\nthe General Assembly and in the face of persistent \r\nand increasing challenges to our resolve to make the \r\nworld a better place, that this Peace Summit has been \r\nconvened as a fitting reminder and inspiration of our \r\nguiding pursuit.\r\nIt is clear, of course, that the peace that we seek \r\ntogether is more than the absence of war. It is premised \r\non the security of people, the security of nation \r\nStates and the building at all levels of frameworks \r\nand institutions, such as the United Nations, that will \r\nunremittingly pursue the realization of this objective. \r\nThe life and work of Nelson Mandela provide stirring \r\nexamples of all those dimensions. His experience as a \r\npolitical prisoner for many years made him a tireless \r\nchampion for the fundamental rights and freedoms \r\nof people everywhere. Mandela’s life was based on a \r\nprofound certainty that there are no differences that \r\njustify discrimination, violence, abuse or oppression. \r\nInstead, he believed in a viable path of cohesion and \r\nunity. It is therefore no coincidence that the basic \r\nstandards for the humane treatment of prisoners bears \r\nthe name “the Mandela principles”.\r\nAt the level of his country, Mandela led with \r\nintegrity and dismantled structures that entrenched \r\ninequality. Beyond that he modelled and instituted \r\na process of national reconciliation that set the \r\nparameters of cohesion, justice and development. As \r\na leader of standing in the international community, \r\nhe contributed to the building of global institutions \r\nthrough his dedication and his decision to advance the \r\nvalues and aspirations of the United Nations through \r\nthe promotion of conflict resolution, human rights \r\nand equality. South Africa’s decision to voluntarily \r\nrelinquish nuclear weapons is one that has set a high bar \r\nof efficacious action in the pursuit of peace. Together, \r\nthose contributions warrant a singular place for Nelson \r\nMandela as one whose name can, with credit, bear the \r\nmessage of the commitment to peace. The designation \r\nof Nelson Mandela International Day is therefore a \r\nfitting reminder of his objective and ongoing work to \r\nachieve global peace.\r\nNelson Mandela has shown us that it is necessary \r\nfor us to work for the peace that we want. Progress \r\nis not possible without sacrifice, patience, diligence \r\nand a broadness of spirit that embraces forgiveness, \r\nreconciliation and new beginnings. Furthermore, \r\nenlightened and determined actions are required from \r\nindividuals, from nations and from us all together as an \r\ninternational community. In that regard we cannot rest \r\nwhile abuse, violence and discrimination are rampant. \r\nWe must also eliminate the implements of warfare that \r\ncause suffering, insecurity and fear among the peoples \r\nof the world. Our efforts to eradicate poverty in all its \r\nforms and to empower men, women, young people and \r\nthe marginalized to reach their full potential must be \r\naccelerated. Those are all dimensions and facets of \r\nour work for peace. For that reason, we reaffirm the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, as a veritable \r\nmechanism to stimulate action in all areas in the cause \r\nof peace and to ensure that no one is left behind. In that \r\nregard, we share the view that there can be no peace \r\nwithout sustainable development and no sustainable \r\ndevelopment without peace.\r\nGlobal peace is cast as an elusive dream far too \r\noften. And for many — and too often — it has and \r\ncontinues to be elusive. The life of Madiba provides \r\npersuasive confirmation of the efficacy of the \r\ncontribution of consistent and principled efforts to the \r\npursuit of peace at all levels. To that end, Guyana fully \r\nendorses the political declaration adopted by the Nelson \r\nMandela Peace Summit and renews its commitment to \r\nthe creation of a peaceful and cohesive society and a \r\nworld in which peace and the pursuit thereof prevail.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Leona Marlin-Romeo, Prime Minister \r\nof Sint Maarten of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\r\nMs. Marlin-Romero (Netherlands): Today I am \r\ntruly grateful on this occasion to participate in this \r\nPeace Summit devoted to one of the most prominent \r\nrevolutionary figures of our time, Nelson Mandela. \r\nDedicating the 2019-2028 period to Nelson Mandela as \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 31/86\r\naffirmed in the political declaration (resolution 73/1) \r\nadopted today has great symbolic and inspirational value. \r\nLet me seize this opportunity to thank South Africa and \r\nIreland for their valuable efforts in co-facilitating the \r\ndrafting process. Today’s global challenges and threats \r\nremind us that the world that Madiba hoped for, the \r\nworld envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nis still far from being a reality. We need to step up our \r\nefforts. As the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza said, \r\n“peace is not the absence of war; it is a virtue, a state \r\nof mind, a disposition of benevolence, confidence, \r\njustice”.\r\nMadiba already saw in political, social and \r\neconomic exclusion key factors in igniting and \r\nperpetuating conflict. The peacebuilding and sustaining \r\npeace agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment are the most comprehensive tools for \r\nachieving a sustainable, long-lasting peace that leaves \r\nno behind. Promoting and implementing them must be \r\nour priority. More inclusive societies, socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment and access to justice is what they envision, \r\ntogether with a key role for local leadership.\r\nMadiba inspired us to aim for a world where, to use \r\nhis own words,\r\n“colour, race and gender become only a God-given \r\ngift to each one of us and not an indelible mark or \r\nattribute that accords a special status to any”.\r\nIndeed, building an exclusive society where all its \r\nparts can actively participate and contribute, including \r\nwomen and youth, leads to stronger and more reliable \r\ninstitutions able to address people’s needs and thus \r\nto prevent the outburst of conflict. Civil-society \r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations \r\nplay a vital role in helping Governments to achieve \r\nthis purpose.\r\nLet me also share my country’s experience. The \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands comprises four countries: \r\nthe Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, \r\nand each relies on an inclusive approach to foster \r\nsustainable development and promote peace. The \r\nsociety we seek to create must be a people-centred \r\nsociety. All its institutions and its resources must \r\nbe dedicated to the pursuit of a better life for all our \r\ncitizens, as Mandela claimed.\r\nNelson Mandela embodies the values and principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We have \r\na serious responsibility towards future generations, \r\npreserving his legacy and carrying on his hopes for a \r\nbetter, fairer world. Ensuring our people’s fundamental \r\nhuman rights, the rule of law and human dignity is the \r\nfoundation of freedom, justice and peace, values to \r\nwhich my country is staunchly committed.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Adel Ahmed \r\nAl-Jubeir, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia, who will speak on behalf of the Group \r\nof Arab States.\r\nMr. Al-Jubeir (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nam pleased to stand before the General Assembly today \r\non behalf of the League of Arab States and the country \r\nthat served as President of the twenty-ninth Arab \r\nSummit, namely, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We \r\nare here to participate in this Peace Summit, a summit \r\nbearing the name of a man who changed history through \r\nhis tolerance, patience, and human qualities, despite \r\nthe many years of pain, suffering and incarceration \r\nhe endured as he fought for peace, security and \r\ndevelopment in South Africa and throughout the world.\r\nThat great man was born 100 years ago. He lived for \r\npeace which was his aim, and earned the appreciation \r\nand respect of the entire world.\r\nThe late President Nelson Mandela had strong \r\nhistorical links with the leadership of the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. He always \r\nsupported the primary Arab and Muslim cause, \r\nnamely, that of Palestine. He supported the right of the \r\nPalestinian people to their independent State within \r\nthe 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nin accordance with international laws, the relevant \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative. We will never forget his famous words \r\nwhen he said that the South African revolution will not \r\nachieve all its objectives until the Palestinian people \r\nenjoy their freedom.\r\nThe late President Mandela also supported several \r\nother Arab causes, and together with the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia, made contributions to resolving the \r\nLockerbie issue, a rather thorny matter in 1999.\r\nSocial justice and the culture of peace and freedom \r\nwere always the watchwords of Nelson Mandela. He \r\nprovided inspiration to many people around the world. \r\nHe made a major contribution to the promotion of peace, \r\nhuman rights and sustainable development, as well \r\nas a dignified life. Perhaps one of the most important \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n32/86 18-29599\r\nlessons that we can learn from Nelson Mandela is to \r\ncontinue building and strengthening peace and security \r\nthroughout the world in order to achieve well-being for \r\nour peoples, and to enjoy security, peace and prosperity \r\nby promoting peaceful coexistence among peoples \r\nand respecting the principle of non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of other countries.\r\nIn conclusion, on behalf of my country, the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the members of the \r\nLeague of Arab States, I would like to thank the United \r\nNations for the efforts it has made, particularly in \r\nconvening this Nelson Mandela Peace Summit, aimed \r\nat expressing loyalty and appreciation to a man who \r\nwas a role model of patience, tolerance and humanity, \r\nas well as fighting poverty and racism. He worked for \r\nthe achievement of peace, security and development in \r\nhis country and throughout the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Didier Reynders, \r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign and \r\nEuropean Affairs of the Kingdom of Belgium.\r\nMr. Reynders (Belgium) (spoke in French): To \r\ncelebrate the centenary of the birth of the great man \r\nNelson Mandela means taking the time to remember \r\nthis simple truth: things always seem impossible, until \r\nthey come true.\r\nPulling a country out of 50 years of a despicable \r\napartheid regime was the work of a lifetime. It would \r\nprobably have been easier to give up, or to give in to \r\nanger or violence. But Nelson Mandela never ceased \r\nto believe in people, in their capacity for humanity, \r\ndignity, solidarity and mutual respect. His struggle \r\nwas based on the values of peace, democracy and \r\nreconciliation, which continue to inspire us on a daily \r\nbasis. The legacy of Madiba should resonate all the \r\nmore forcefully today, as our world is still prey to many \r\nviolent conflicts and too many people, women and \r\nchildren, experience war, exile and poverty.\r\nBelgium is one of the founding Members of the \r\nUnited Nations and also of the European Union. Our \r\nmodern history is closely linked to the creation of \r\nmultilateral institutions born after the Second World \r\nWar. For centuries, my country was Europe’s battlefield. \r\nBut for the past 70 years, it has sat on an equal footing \r\nwith its neighbours in international institutions. \r\nMultilateralism is an asset of our generation. In \r\nBelgium, it is now part of our political DNA.\r\nSome say that our common institutions have \r\nbecome ineffective in solving the problems of our time. \r\nAccording to them, multilateralism has become an \r\nexpression of our weakness. I do not subscribe to that \r\nview. Multilateralism is a form of wealth; indeed, it is \r\na force. Multilateralism protects. It protects the weak, \r\nbut it also protects the strong, because in our globalized \r\nworld, no State is safe from the upheavals that shake \r\nour planet. None of us by ourselves has the solution to \r\nour challenges. Multilateralism is the possibility of a \r\nsolution; it is an assurance that the rule of law prevails \r\nover the principle that “might is right”.\r\nIn Belgium we became multilateralists out of \r\nnecessity. Today we are even more convinced. We are \r\nfirmly committed to those principles, and it is with \r\nconstant and determined commitment that we put them \r\ninto practice in our foreign policy.\r\nOur upcoming participation in the Security Council \r\nwill be in line with that approach: Belgium will be a \r\nreliable and predictable partner, always seeking to \r\npromote consensus, without, of course, giving up the \r\nvalues that we hold dear. Madiba said, “If you want to \r\nmake peace with your enemy, you have to work with \r\nyour enemy. Then he becomes your partner”. At all \r\ntimes during its mandate, Belgium will promote mutual \r\nunderstanding rather than punishment, consultation \r\nrather than confrontation, the force of law rather than \r\nthe right to use force.\r\nBelgium applauds the adoption of our political \r\ndeclaration (resolution 73/1) today. That is the best \r\nresponse that our community could provide to the \r\ntemptations of national withdrawal. Our declaration \r\ngives us the strength to continue our efforts, and I \r\npledge to the General Assembly that the declaration \r\nwill form a pillar of our diplomacy for years to come.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nnow give the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Vivian \r\nBalakrishnan, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Singapore, who will speak on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations.\r\nMr. Balakrishnan (Singapore): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the 10 States members of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nand, of course, on behalf of my own tiny city-State, \r\nSingapore.\r\nIt is most timely that the Nelson Mandela Peace \r\nSummit has been convened during the high-level \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 33/86\r\nweek of the United Nations General Assembly, as \r\nwe commemorate the centenary of his birth. ASEAN \r\nendorses the political declaration adopted at the \r\nopening of the Peace Summit (resolution 73/1). Let me \r\nquote Mr. Mandela’s own words. He said:\r\n“Action without vision is only passing time, \r\nvision without action is merely daydreaming, but \r\nvision with action can change the world.”\r\nI believe that all of us can agree that Mr. Mandela \r\ntransformed his country, but he also changed the world.\r\nSouth-East Asia and South Africa are geographically \r\nvery far apart, but that distance has in no way lessened \r\nthe impact that Mr. Mandela has had on ASEAN, both \r\non our individual member States and on its membership \r\nas a regional grouping. The ideals embodied by \r\nMr. Mandela — quiet dignity, extraordinary compassion \r\nand unflinching integrity — have inspired generations \r\nthroughout our region.\r\nIndeed, South-East Asia shares fond memories of \r\nMr. Mandela. In 1997, he visited South-East Asia and, \r\nwhile in Singapore, met our founding Prime Minister, \r\nMr. Lee Kuan Yew, and delivered the Singapore \r\nLecture. Mr. Mandela spoke of coming to our region to \r\nrekindle old times and old relationships, and he urged \r\nus to forge strong multilateral ties. While in Indonesia, \r\nhe stressed the need for unity in diversity and observed \r\nthat both South Africa and South-East Asia had much to \r\nlearn from each other, especially how we view diverse \r\npeoples and cultures as a source of strength for our \r\ncommunities and not as a source of division. More than \r\ntwo decades later, Mr. Mandela’s message continues \r\nto resonate.\r\nThroughout his life, Mr. Mandela was a champion \r\nfor peace and reconciliation. Those ideals continue to \r\nresonate with us. Since the inception of ASEAN in \r\n1967, we have worked to create a culture of dialogue, \r\nconsensus and cooperation in order to support our \r\ncommon effort to achieve sustainable development for \r\nthe betterment of the lives of all our peoples. Through \r\nan open, inclusive, ASEAN-led regional architecture, \r\nwe have continued to engage all of the major countries \r\nin order to maintain peace, stability and prosperity \r\nthroughout South-East Asia.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing ASEAN’s deep \r\nrespect for his legacy — a legacy that has inspired, and \r\ncontinues to inspire, all of us in South-East Asia. We \r\nwill do our best to emulate those ideals, to enhance our \r\nregional peace, security and prosperity, and to uphold \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nFinally, we are reminded of Mr. Mandela’s \r\nwise words:\r\n“What counts in life is not the mere fact that we \r\nhave lived. It is what difference we have made to the \r\nlives of others that will determine the significance \r\nof the life we lead.”\r\nLong may the memory of Mr. Mandela remain strong \r\nin us. Along with all people all around the world, we in \r\nSouth-East Asia will not forget Mr. Mandela and his \r\nprofound contributions to the international community.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Taro Kono, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Japan.\r\nMr. Kono (Japan): Mr. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela \r\nwas a man of conviction, a promoter of reconciliation \r\nand a beacon of hope for the future. One hundred years \r\nago, in 1918, a tireless fighter, a man who would change \r\nhistory, was born. In the following month, the Japanese \r\nConsulate was established in Cape Town; it was Japan’s \r\nfirst official mission on the African continent. More \r\nthan 70 years later, Mr. Mandela was at a reception \r\nhosted by Japan. It was his first appearance of that kind \r\nafter his release in 1990.\r\nLater that year, he was in Japan as the first African \r\nleader to address the Parliament of Japan. He stressed \r\nthe need to unite not only South Africa but also the \r\ninternational community in order to solve the many \r\nproblems caused by apartheid through negotiations and \r\nsupport the efforts by the people of South Africa by \r\nproviding necessary resources. He once said,\r\n“An injury to one is an injury to all ... None \r\nof us acting alone can achieve success ... We \r\nmust therefore act together as a united people, for \r\nnational reconciliation, for nation-building, for the \r\nbirth of a new world”.\r\nMr. Mandela visited Japan three times. During those \r\nvisits, he demonstrated strong interest in the history of \r\nJapan’s development. That history would lead to the \r\nconcept of human security, which is consistent with \r\nMr. Mandela’s convictions, as it is a people-centred, \r\ncomprehensive and preventive approach that empowers \r\nvulnerable individuals. We think about how much hope \r\nwe placed in Mr. Mandela for our future. However, his \r\nwill and deeds indicate that it is in us that he placed \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n34/86 18-29599\r\nhis hope for the future. Japan has been committed to \r\nfulfilling the hope that Mr. Mandela placed in us.\r\nNext year, Japan will host the seventh meeting \r\nof the Tokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment (TICAD 7), which was initiated a \r\nquarter-century ago. In preparation, Japan launched \r\ndiscussions with former African Presidents so as \r\nto gain insights into peace, security and stability in \r\nAfrica. TICAD 7 will offer another important venue \r\nto promote peacebuilding based on African ownership \r\nand a broad partnership with the United Nations and \r\nother international bodies.\r\nNow, 100 years after Mr. Mandela’s birth and \r\nfollowing the more than 70 years since the founding \r\nof the United Nations, we need to act more quickly and \r\neffectively for the benefit of all. To that end, the United \r\nNations, including the Security Council, needs to be \r\nreformed, and Japan supports the Secretary-General’s \r\ninitiative to rebalance United Nations peace activities \r\naway from merely “reacting” towards “preventing”.\r\nTogether with the international community, \r\nespecially Africa, Japan will steadily continue to take \r\nsteps toward making the world a better place, following \r\nthe path that Mr. Mandela walked, which has now \r\nbeen passed on to each one of us. We will never forget \r\nMr. Mandela’s words. “It always seems impossible until \r\nit is done.”\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Josep Borrell \r\nFontelles, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation \r\nof the Kingdom of Spain.\r\nMr. Borrell Fontelles (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nIt is a singular honour for me to be here today at this \r\nSummit to commemorate the centenary of the great \r\nman that was Nelson Mandela, Madiba. On the 100th \r\nanniversary of his birth, we welcome this occasion to \r\ntake stock of his legacy. To speak of him is to speak of \r\nhope, virtue, generosity and reconciliation. He taught \r\nus many things, including that to be free is to live in a \r\nway that respects and enhances the freedom of others. \r\nHis legacy needs to be remembered today to give it \r\nnew life.\r\nThe political declaration that the 193 States \r\nadopted today in the General Assembly (resolution \r\n73/1) shows that we are convinced and determined to \r\nfulfil that legacy, which places human dignity at the \r\ncentre of our action. It is necessary to do so, as injustice \r\nand inequality persist. It seems that economic growth \r\nbenefits only those who have the most. We are living \r\nthrough an identity crisis, which has made it difficult \r\nfor us to remember who we are and that our traditions \r\nare threatened by globalization.\r\nMadiba would have responded to such fears by \r\nrestoring optimism, because when he was born, a \r\nwar had ravaged the European continent, and, later, \r\nafter another devastating war, the United Nations, the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the Geneva \r\nConventions and the rules of world trade were born, \r\nall with the aim of ensuring that human beings possess \r\nequal dignity and are free from fear and misery.\r\nThen we saw the 1990s and following decades, \r\nwhere great strides were made — the International \r\nCriminal Court, the 2005 World Summit, the collective \r\nresponsibility to protect, new advances in education, \r\nin gender equality, in access to water, education and \r\nhealth, and in the fight against discrimination. But \r\nthere certainly remains a long way to go, and that is \r\nwhat we reaffirm today in our commitment embodied \r\nin today’s political declaration. Yes, there are still \r\nenormous challenges. As Madiba told us:\r\n“After climbing a great hill, one only finds that \r\nthere are many more hills to climb.”\r\nThe line of the horizon always seems to move away \r\nfrom us and behind each peak there seems to be another. \r\nTo the sceptics, to those who are discouraged today, \r\nI can certainly draw their attention to a few things, \r\nnamely, the Paris Conference on  Climate Change; the \r\nhistoric march for women’s equality, which f looded the \r\nstreets of half the world, including in my country; and \r\nthe global pacts on migration and refugees. We must \r\ncontinue along this path, and we applaud the decision \r\nto celebrate the centenary of Mandela’s birth as an \r\nincentive for working together, an injection of optimism \r\nand a gesture of recognition for the immense value of \r\nhis legacy.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to Her Excellency Ms. Harriett Baldwin, \r\nMinister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth \r\nOffice of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland.\r\nMs. Baldwin (United Kingdom): Today we mark \r\n100 years since the birth of an individual whose name \r\nhas become the byword for courage, compassion and \r\nmoral strength. Nelson Mandela was a titan of our age, \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 35/86\r\na symbol of hope, a true hero of the twentieth century. \r\nHis legacy continues to resonate with those fighting for \r\na better, fairer, more equal world.\r\nI am delighted to offer the United Kingdom’s full \r\nsupport for today’s political declaration (resolution \r\n73/1), as well as our appreciation for Nelson Mandela’s \r\nachievements and our commitment to advancing the \r\nissues that he was so passionate about. Nelson Mandela \r\nspoke many times about the dehumanizing effect \r\nof poverty and the suffering of children deprived of \r\nadequate food, health care or education. He spoke of \r\nothers deprived of their childhoods by conflict, and he \r\nreminded us that, under the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, every person is entitled to equal rights \r\nand freedoms without distinction of any kind. He said \r\nthat none of us should be satisfied or at peace if others \r\nwere struggling for their very survival. He challenged \r\nus to work together and to do better.\r\nThis week, as we come together for the opening \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, \r\nwe have an opportunity through the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s sustaining peace agenda to rise to Nelson \r\nMandela’s challenge. Together, we must do more to \r\nprevent conflict, end poverty and protect the planet, \r\nso that people everywhere can enjoy peace, security \r\nand prosperity. The United Kingdom restates our \r\ncommitment to the 2030 Agenda, to sustaining peace \r\nand to promoting education for the 131 million girls \r\nworldwide who are missing out on school.\r\nMr. Tangara (Gambia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nNelson Mandela once said that “courage [is] not the \r\nabsence of fear, but the triumph over it”. Today, let us be \r\ninspired by his courage, his wisdom and his resilience. \r\nLet us work together in his name for peace, for human \r\nrights and for equality. Let us rise to his challenge and \r\nuse his legacy to make the world a better place.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Juan Orlando \r\nHernández Alvarado, President of the Republic of \r\nHonduras.\r\nPresident Hernández Alvarado (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Today we applaud the General Assembly for \r\nrecognizing and extol that  extraordinary leader and \r\nbulwark of freedom and world peace, Nelson Mandela. \r\nHowever, I cannot fail to call for us, today and for the \r\nrest of this summit, not just to remember him, as he \r\ndeserves, or to commemorate that great human being, \r\nbut to truly honour his memory by following in his \r\nfootsteps and, as he said so well, by beginning to do \r\nwhat seems impossible today. We cannot continue \r\nto have meetings, tracing the routes of what will, no \r\ndoubt, lead us to build a fairer, more prosperous and \r\nfreer world, without really taking the necessary steps \r\nand fulfilling the corresponding actions that would \r\nturn his dream into reality. In short, we need concrete \r\nactions that produce results.\r\nNelson Mandela has been an example to follow \r\nin my country, which has in recent years experienced \r\npolitical and social situations in which we have been \r\ncalled to enter into dialogue and show understanding, \r\nrespect, forgiveness and reconciliation. It is not a simple \r\ntask because, as the Nobel Peace Prize winner put it, \r\n“It is so easy to break down and destroy. The heroes \r\nare those who make peace and build”. In that sense, \r\nHonduras recognizes that a country at peace is only \r\npossible with more and better opportunities for all, with \r\nbetter standards of living and higher levels of dignity \r\nfor each person. That is why we have worked tirelessly \r\nto reduce the rates of violence and multidimensional \r\npoverty in our country.\r\nHonduras has taken significant steps to strengthen \r\nthe prevention of violence. It is clear that we still lack \r\na great deal of what our citizens need. We have been \r\nmobilizing investment like never before in what are \r\nto become the solid bases of a new system of quality \r\neducation and health. To give just one example, 40 per \r\ncent of the resources previously allocated to security as a \r\nspecial budget item will today become the fundamental \r\nbasis for the prevention of violence, as these resources \r\nwill be invested in quality education, keeping in mind \r\nthat people are not free and will never enjoy peace \r\nwithout access to quality services.\r\nOn 20 August 2018, in Honduras, we created a \r\nspecial commission for transforming the health system, \r\nwhose members we have entrusted to work to achieve \r\nsuch early victories as the provision of 100 per cent \r\nof supplies and medicines in hospitals, as well as the \r\nreduction of surgical delays and the time people have to \r\nwait for medical appointments. On 19 September 2018, \r\nwe also took a historic step by forming a commission \r\nfor world-class quality education to transform the \r\neducational model, but with the participation of various \r\nsectors of society, with the objective of providing an \r\neducation that is valid and competitive.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n36/86 18-29599\r\nIn the fight against organized crime, which is a \r\npriority for our Government, it has become clear that \r\nthe role played by criminal groups such as adult and \r\nyouth gangs puts constraints on the State’s efforts \r\naimed at sustainable development. Above all, they have \r\nbeen the protagonists of the greatest tragedy in terms of \r\nthe loss of human lives in the history of our Republic.\r\nThat is why I never tire of emphasizing this \r\nissue, and I take this opportunity to ask the General \r\nAssembly and the United Nations itself to recognize \r\nthat, in the case of Honduras, gangs are also violating \r\nthe fundamental rights of individuals. If that is not \r\nrecognized, the international community would fail \r\nto understand a fundamental part of the problem that \r\nnot only Honduras but also many other countries in the \r\nCentral American region are facing. For that reason, \r\nwe have requested the support of the United Nations to \r\nadopt a draft resolution recognizing and condemning \r\nsuch groups as armed non-State actors, and thereby \r\npromote international cooperation to combat them. To \r\nthat end, we ask for the support of the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime, and, at the same time, we \r\nask the Office of the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights in Tegucigalpa to take on the problem.\r\nIn that regard, I cannot hold back my frustration \r\nwhen we meet in forums such as this one and express \r\nour most sincere desire to work together as teams in \r\npeacebuilding, but we lack the will and courage to \r\nmake it a reality, to turn that desire into concrete results \r\nthat will have an impact on the lives of our peoples. \r\nThat same will and courage characterized and has led \r\nus today to remember Nelson Mandela as one of the \r\ngreatest heroes of our history. Mandela mobilized the \r\nworld and got it to recognize the problem in his country \r\nthat his people were experiencing, and that is where the \r\nsolution to the problem began.\r\nThat is why I now call on the United Nations to adopt, \r\non our path towards the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, the aforementioned \r\ndraft resolution and recognize that the various gangs \r\nin Honduras are increasingly attacking freedoms, \r\ndemocracy, peace and, above all, the fundamental right \r\nto life of our peoples. Likewise, we call on developed \r\ncountries to allocate more resources to cooperation \r\nand the transfer of knowledge and technologies to \r\ndeveloping countries, resources other than earmarked \r\nfor financing wars and preventing irregular migrations, \r\nbecause the latter could be translated into resources \r\nearmarked to help eradicate violence, promote peace, \r\nconserve the environment and invest in general \r\neconomic growth, which is the way to radically attack \r\nthe root causes of such problems as irregular migration. \r\nNo citizen in the world is going to emigrate from his or \r\nher country if that country is peaceful and prosperous \r\nand offers opportunities.\r\nThroughout this day we have listened and will \r\ncontinue to listen to the wise words of Nelson Mandela, \r\nand many of us will repeat the famous quotes that have \r\nurged the world to forgive, love and build. However, I \r\nwould like to close my address with a quotation that \r\nis little known but that is undoubtedly very relevant \r\ntoday. Madiba said,\r\n“It is never my custom to use words lightly. If \r\n27 years in prison have done anything to us, it was \r\nto use the silence of solitude to make us understand \r\nhow precious words are and how real speech is in \r\nits impact on the way people live and die.”\r\nLet us not take lightly the words we have spoken \r\nand heard today and we will continue to hear. Let us not \r\nallow the words that make up the political declaration \r\nthat we adopted today (resolution 73/1) to remain mere \r\nwords on paper. Our peoples are troubled and frustrated, \r\nand rightly so. Let us give those words the weight they \r\ndeserve, and let us live up to them with genuine resolve \r\nand courage in order to change the course of our history. \r\nIt is in our hands whether people live or die, depending \r\non how we use our words.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Nasser Bourita, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and International \r\nCooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco.\r\nMr. Bourita (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): His \r\nMajesty King Mohammed VI has requested me to \r\nread out this royal message at this summit meeting \r\nhonouring Nelson Mandela:\r\n“The late Nelson Mandela embodies above all \r\nsuch values as tolerance and humility. The world \r\nthinks highly and fondly of him because of his \r\nstruggles. The world admires him for his strength \r\nof character, his concern for vulnerable people \r\nand his fight, which he waged throughout his life, \r\nagainst discrimination and inequality.\r\n“Madiba undoubtedly had an important \r\nMoroccan chapter in his rich life. He nourished \r\nsincere affection for my late father, His Majesty \r\nKing Hassan II — may he rest in peace — whom he \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 37/86\r\nheld in high esteem. That affection was mutual. It \r\nstemmed from the unconditional support provided \r\nby Morocco to African liberation movements. That \r\nwas a constant factor during the reign of my late \r\ngrandfather, His Majesty King Mohammed V, and of \r\nmy late father, His Majesty King Hassan II. Both of \r\nthem welcomed all African liberation movements. \r\nWhen they sought help and support, they used the \r\nKingdom as a military and political base.\r\n“Between 1960 and 1962, Mandela lived \r\nin Morocco, where he received the Kingdom’s \r\nsupport in his legitimate struggle. That continuous \r\nand multiform support during the years of \r\nstruggle in South African included the training \r\nof African National Congress (ANC) members in \r\nthe Oujda region, the provision of logistical and \r\nmilitary assistance to the ANC, and support for \r\nthe diplomatic activities led by Nelson Mandela’s \r\nmovement abroad.\r\n“In reviewing those historical facts, we do \r\nnot wish simply to remind everyone of Morocco’s \r\nleading role in supporting Mandela but, rather, to \r\nunderscore the convergence of our two courses of \r\nhistory and the sense of a common commitment \r\nthat ought to continue today. In appreciation of \r\nthat precious assistance, Nelson Mandela made \r\nit a point to come to Morocco in November 1994 \r\nto demonstrate his unflinching solidarity with \r\nthe people of Morocco. On that occasion, he was \r\ndecorated by His late Majesty King Hassan II — may \r\nhe rest in peace — with the highest distinction \r\nin recognition of the exceptional struggle he had \r\nwaged for equality and justice.\r\n“Nelson Mandela embodied not only the \r\nstruggle of an entire people, but also that of an \r\nentire continent: our Africa. He was an advocate \r\nfor the principles of equity, probity and universal \r\nmorality. He belonged to the category of African \r\nleaders who were committed to humanist values \r\nand lofty principles.\r\n“His stance on the preservation of national \r\nsovereignty earned him the status of champion of \r\npeace and understanding between nations — a stance \r\nfar removed from the vicissitudes, uncertainties \r\nand calculations of harmful divisions. To those \r\nwho advocated separatism, Mandela responded \r\nby championing unity, for he understood that our \r\ncontinent’s future development hinged on the \r\nterritorial integrity of its States.\r\n“Mandela, as a politician, was always \r\ncharacterized by sound thinking and judgments; his \r\nmajor decisions were never made hastily. Without \r\na doubt, he incarnated a school of wisdom that his \r\nsuccessors should now continue. The values that he \r\nembodied with unwavering courage are the very \r\nsame ones to which we firmly adhere in Morocco. \r\nThey are the guiding principles and vectors of my \r\ncountry’s political and civic action in the Kingdom, \r\nacross Africa and around our world.\r\n“With his complete humility, he was a universal \r\nfigure — larger than life — who embodied a \r\nparticular vision of the world. That extraordinary \r\nman belongs indisputably to a category of \r\nuniversal people whose destiny has local, national, \r\ncontinental and global implications. Mandela \r\nbelongs to all of us. He had a vision and values that \r\nwe must uphold. He called upon us to transcend our \r\ndivisions, whether political or economic.\r\n“To grapple with the scourge of racism, \r\nhe advocated liberation; to tackle partition, he \r\nchampioned unity; and to ward off the perils of \r\nfragmentation and marginalization, he opted for \r\nunification. He was a relentless advocate of progress \r\nand prosperity, instead of underdevelopment and \r\nisolation. Those are the virtues that he was keen to \r\nshare in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech. \r\nThey represent the quintessence of his action in \r\ntoday’s world.\r\n“We find his absence so unbearable that we \r\nprefer to celebrate his birth — one of those births \r\nthat are honoured worldwide. Another birth that \r\nhumankind owes to Africa.”\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Dato’ Saifuddin Abdullah, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Abdullah (Malaysia): Malaysia joins other \r\nspeakers in commending the President for convening \r\nthis landmark Nelson Mandela Peace Summit.\r\nWe align ourselves with the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of Singapore on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, and the \r\nstatement to be delivered by the representative of \r\nVenezuela on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n38/86 18-29599\r\nWe commend the Permanent Representatives of \r\nSouth Africa and Ireland for facilitating the political \r\ndeclaration that was adopted this morning (resolution \r\n73/1). The comprehensive, transparent and inclusive \r\napproach taken by the co-facilitators, as well as \r\nthe f lexibility shown by all delegations during the \r\nnegotiations, surely befit the legacy of a great man for \r\nwhom we are all gathered here today in commemoration.\r\nMalaysia welcomes the political declaration \r\nhonouring the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. \r\nWe remember him for his struggle and personal \r\nsacrifice in championing human rights for his people. \r\nWe remember him for striving for global peace. It may \r\nnot be overzealous to say that the world is also indebted \r\nto Mr. Mandela for his contribution to the struggle for \r\ndemocracy worldwide and the promotion of the culture \r\nof peace throughout the world.\r\nWe therefore join other Member States in paying \r\ntribute to Madiba for his qualities of humility, \r\nforgiveness and compassion; his values and dedication \r\nto the service of humankind; and the dignified role \r\nhe played as a humanitarian in the fields of conflict \r\nresolution and reconciliation, disarmament, race \r\nrelations, gender equality and the rights of children \r\nand other vulnerable groups. This Peace Summit also \r\noffers us the opportunity to revive the values for which \r\nNelson Mandela stood.\r\nIn order for us to ensure lasting peace and prevent \r\nconflicts around the globe, Malaysia believes that we \r\nshould shift our focus to how we think about conflicts \r\nand how we address and solve them. Sustaining \r\npeace initiatives must be built on a more coordinated, \r\nintegrated and inclusive system-wide approach by \r\nall stakeholders, particularly United Nations bodies, \r\nregional and subregional organizations and civil-\r\nsociety organizations, including the participation of \r\nwomen and youth. We are also of the view that both \r\nsustaining peace efforts and the promotion of a culture \r\nof peace must be in line with the implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, for example leaving no \r\none behind.\r\nIn addition, Malaysia continues to reiterate the \r\nimportance of addressing the root causes of conflicts; \r\nrespecting national sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity; confronting oppression; promoting good \r\ngovernance and the rule of law; eradicating poverty; \r\npromoting sustained economic growth; and improving \r\nintercultural understanding on the basis of mutual \r\nrespect and acceptance.\r\nWhen Nelson Mandela first visited Malaysia in \r\n1990, he was keen to hear about our experiences in \r\nnation-building. Our country has recently concluded \r\nits fourteenth general elections, where, just as in \r\nthe historic South African elections in 1994, a new \r\nGovernment has been empowered through the voice of \r\nthe people.\r\nLet me conclude by calling on all present here \r\ntoday to live up to Mandela’s spirit by committing to the \r\nnoble cause of peace, with the courage, determination \r\nand will for which we all remember him.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Péter Szijjártó, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Trade of Hungary.\r\nMr. Szijjártó (Hungary): We appreciate the efforts \r\nput forth to convene this very important landmark \r\nmeeting, especially under the current circumstances \r\nwhen a new world order is under construction. The new \r\nworld order seeks essentially to oppose the new security \r\nthreats to the entire world. I think that at a summit \r\nnamed after Nelson Mandela it is appropriate to speak \r\nabout those new types of threats and their existence in \r\nareas of the world that have been considered supposedly \r\nsafe in recent times. I would like to mention three \r\nfactors that endanger international peace and stability.\r\nFirst, there are massive f lows of illegal migration, \r\nwhich the whole world has experienced recently, \r\nespecially in Europe. We understand that  uncontrolled \r\nmassive f lows of people offer terrorist organizations \r\nthe opportunity to disperse their activists and terrorists \r\nthroughout the world, thereby spreading the terror threat \r\nof terror worldwide, including in places previously \r\nuntouched by that phenomenon, such as Europe.\r\nThat is why I believe that we must pool our efforts \r\nto tackle the root causes of illegal migration. We must \r\nstop the promotion of the violation of borders and \r\nprovide the necessary assistance on the issue so that such \r\nproblems are not imported into places where they had \r\nnever existed before. We must reject any approach that \r\nsuggests that migration is a fundamental human right, \r\nbecause that is not in line with international conventions.\r\nSecondly, I would like to address the issue of \r\nnational minorities worldwide. All of us, within the \r\nUnited Nations, must make clear that the rights of \r\nnational minorities must be respected — a duty that \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 39/86\r\nfalls to the United Nations. We have to make sure that \r\nthere are consequences to bear whenever the rights of \r\nnational minorities are violated. At such a summit, I \r\nbelieve that it is appropriate to say that we must see \r\nnational minorities as sources of strength, cooperation \r\nand friendship between nations, and we must reject all \r\napproaches that suggest that they are a source of tension.\r\nThirdly, we must raise our voice in support of those \r\nreligious groups all around the world that are suffering \r\nat the hands of regimes that do not take seriously the \r\nfreedom of religion. We must speak up for Christian \r\ncommunities globally, since Christianity has become \r\nthe most persecuted religion on Earth — something to \r\nwhich we must not turn a blind eye. We must put an \r\nend to hypocrisy and political correctness. We must pay \r\ndue attention to the issue of the destiny of Christian \r\ncommunities all over the world. At the United Nations, \r\nwe have the obligation to provide legal and security \r\nguarantees to Christian communities worldwide for \r\ntheir return to the homes they have f led in places where \r\nthey had lived for centuries, or even for a millennium.\r\nThat is why we hope that the General Assembly \r\nwill seriously take that into consideration and address \r\nthe issue of persecuted Christians in the Middle East. \r\nWe really hope that the General Assembly will espouse \r\nthe view that religious and national minorities are a \r\nsource of peace, stability and friendship, rather than \r\nof tension.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin \r\nJassim Al-Thani, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar.\r\nSheikh Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to express our appreciation for the convening of the \r\nNelson Mandela Peace Summit to honour a hero who \r\ndevoted his life to common human values. Today, that \r\nis what our world needs more than ever before. While \r\nthe Summit is an opportunity to reflect upon the legacy \r\nof Nelson Mandela, what is said here also issues a \r\nmessage that reminds us of our responsibility not only \r\nas Member States but also as partners with shared values \r\nand a common destiny. That requires us to cooperate so \r\nas to achieve the goals of the United Nations, in line \r\nwith the legacy of Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela \r\nshouldered the sufferings of his people, and he was \r\nalways a hero for the most vulnerable segments of \r\nsociety. Accordingly, he became a symbol of freedom, \r\njustice, equality, human rights and peace.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in the promotion \r\nand maintenance of peace and security can benefit \r\nfrom Nelson Mandela’s legacy only if we learn from the \r\nlessons he taught and assign priority to the lofty values \r\nthat he defended, as well as renew our commitment to \r\nhuman rights and development for all. We must also \r\nprevent and peacefully resolve conflicts and achieve \r\nsustainable development.\r\nPeace, for Nelson Mandela, was not only the \r\nabsence of fighting but also an environment where \r\neveryone prospers, regardless of race, colour or \r\nbeliefs. Those differences are elements that enrich \r\nhumankind. Our diversity is a source of power and \r\ncannot cause divisions. We can achieve a lot through \r\nour common humanity.\r\nAs part of our joint efforts to achieve peace and \r\nend violations of international law, we must recall \r\nNelson Mandela’s affirmation of the United Nations \r\nrole as a peacemaker in conflict resolution and its \r\nrole in implementing measures to overcome threats to \r\npeace. He believed in our ability to change the world \r\nand make it a better place in which we are confident \r\nthat we, as the international community, are capable of \r\nachieving the objectives of the United Nations — at the \r\nforefront of which are peace, human rights and respect \r\nfor international law.\r\nNelson Mandela fought against injustice through \r\nhis persistent belief in the rule of law and human \r\ndignity, and he was able to impose a common respect \r\nfor such human values. He enjoyed the respect of his \r\npeople and the world. He is a light for everyone to learn \r\nfrom, particularly those who violate international law. \r\nHistory will not forget the violators and perpetrators of \r\ncrime. Nelson Mandela will remain a shining light and \r\na force for justice, equality and peace.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by Her Excellency Sheikh Hasina, \r\nPrime Minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.\r\nSheikh Hasina (Bangladesh): I thank the President \r\nfor convening this Peace Summit on the occasion of \r\nthe 100th anniversary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. \r\nNelson Mandela began his political life as a leader of his \r\npeople in their fight against apartheid in South Africa. \r\nLater, with his sacrifice, dedication and compassion for \r\npeople, he became the undisputed leader of humankind, \r\nwith peace, freedom and unity as his lifelong mantra.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n40/86 18-29599\r\nPeace is no longer simply the absence of war. In his \r\ndefinition of peace, Bangladesh’s Father of the Nation, \r\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, standing before \r\nthe General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session in \r\n1974, stated\r\n“Our total commitment to peace is born of the \r\nrealization that only an environment of peace \r\nwould enable us to... mobilize and concentrate \r\nall our energies and resources in combating the \r\nscourges of poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and \r\nunemployment.” (A/PV.2243, para. 12)\r\nThe vision of Bangabandhu to establish peace has \r\nguided us all along. We believe and practice friendship \r\nto all and malice towards none. We attach the highest \r\npriority to peace and development. Our investment in \r\npoverty alleviation, public health and education have \r\nenabled us to ensure the well-being of our people and \r\nreduce inequality. We have created opportunities for \r\nindividuals using innovative means and have therefore \r\nestablished peace through socioeconomic development.\r\nOur peacekeepers are saving lives and protecting \r\npeace in many parts of the world. We are working \r\nwith the international community in sustaining peace \r\nthrough conflict prevention, development and the \r\npromotion of human rights. Bangladesh has introduced \r\nthe culture of the peaceful resolution of conflicts into \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nencompasses all aspects of human development — from \r\nhunger to inequality. However, peace continues to elude \r\nus. Conflicts remain a formidable challenge today. \r\nHuman rights and fundamental freedoms, which \r\nleaders like Mandela fought for, have yet to be truly \r\nrealized. People in many parts of the world suffer from \r\nhunger and malnourishment. On the other hand, racism, \r\npopulism and intolerance are on the rise. People face \r\ndiscrimination, forced displacement, torture and even \r\ngenocide because of their ethnic and religious identity. \r\nIn my own country, more than 1 million Rohingya have \r\ntaken shelter to evade the atrocities in Myanmar.\r\nLike Nelson Mandela, in 1971 Bangabandhu Sheikh \r\nMujibur Rahman led us to liberate the Bengali nation \r\nfrom the oppressors. They both spent major parts of \r\ntheir lives in prison, fighting for the freedom of their \r\npeople. Bangabandhu was sent to jail time and again for \r\nstanding up for the freedom of people. While in prison, \r\nhe wrote diaries, which have now been published as \r\nThe Unfinished Memoirs and Prison Diary, in which \r\nhe recorded his struggle for peace for his people. Under \r\nhis leadership, we achieved Bangladesh.\r\nAs a tribute to the great leader Nelson Mandela, \r\nwe are delighted to endorse the political declaration \r\nadopted at this Summit (resolution 73/1) to establish \r\nglobal peace.\r\nTo achieve our target for a peaceful future, we must \r\ncommit to the following steps. First, we must settle all \r\ninternational disputes through peaceful means and \r\nprevent conflict in all circumstances. Secondly, we \r\nmust strengthen cooperation to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Thirdly, we must promote \r\ntolerance, preserve diversity and protect religious and \r\nethnic minorities from discrimination and exploitation. \r\nFourthly, we must fight terrorism by stopping the f low \r\nof financing to terrorists, as well as the supply of arms \r\nto terrorists and their outfits. Fifthly, we must promote \r\nand protect human rights in all circumstances and \r\nnurture a culture of peace and non-violence.\r\nLet me conclude by recalling Mandela’s words:\r\n “As long as poverty, injustice and gross inequality \r\npersist in our world, none of us can truly rest”. \r\nLet us work together to achieve his dream.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Julius Maada \r\nBio, President of the Republic of Sierra Leone.\r\nPresident Bio: Today the Republic of Sierra Leone \r\njoins the States Members of the United Nations at this \r\nhistoric Summit to honour and celebrate the memory \r\nand legacy of Nelson Mandela. This year marks the \r\ncentenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. He was \r\nan African icon, but he belonged to the world. It is \r\ntherefore most appropriate to celebrate and reflect, as \r\nwe are now doing, on his life and times to promote his \r\nlegacy at this Summit.\r\nThe Sierra Leone delegation is here today to declare \r\nthat we salute all the values and principles that Nelson \r\nMandela embodied and upheld. He left us his colossal \r\npresence and the indelible imprint of his words, such as:\r\n“It is so easy to break down and destroy. The heroes \r\nare those who make peace and build.”\r\n“You can start changing our world for the better \r\ndaily, no matter how small the action.”\r\n“What counts in life is not the mere fact that we \r\nhave lived. It is what difference we have made in the \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 41/86\r\nlives of others that will determine the significance \r\nof the life we lead.”\r\nNelson Mandela was consistent and resilient. His \r\nwas a fight for a just, peaceful, prosperous, democratic, \r\nfair, equitable and inclusive world. His promotion \r\nof peace, conflict prevention, reconciliation, unity, \r\nnon-discrimination and the protection and promotion \r\nof human rights all give us reason to reflect. Are we \r\nliving his legacy?\r\nI implore all of us to leave this Hall today with a \r\ndetermination to uphold all the principles enshrined \r\nin the spirit and letter of the political declaration \r\nwe adopted (resolution 73/1). We, the Sierra Leone \r\ndelegation, reiterate our unwavering support for the \r\nSecretary-General’s renewed focus on preventing \r\nconflicts and sustaining peace, and his establishment \r\nof the High-level Advisory Board for Mediation. That, \r\nwe believe, will foster a culture of dialogue that will \r\nultimately lead to the prevention of conflicts around \r\nthe world.\r\nSierra Leone is already a strong supporter of \r\nand contributor to initiatives such as the Pathfinders \r\nfor Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies; the Global \r\nAlliance for Reporting Progress on Peaceful, Just and \r\nInclusive Societies; and the Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 16+ Forum. All of those are clear manifestations \r\nof our respect for the principles and values outlined in \r\nthe declaration.\r\nToday our nation is at peace, which has been a \r\nlong journey. Our nation’s recent history has been \r\nforged from the embers of war and national epidemics. \r\nBut like President Nelson Mandela, we have fashioned, \r\nout of the embers of bloody war and conflict and with \r\nthe help of the world, a stable, peaceful and inclusive \r\ndemocracy. We have emerged much stronger each \r\ntime that war, disease and natural disasters have \r\nthreatened our very existence as a nation. Our peaceful \r\ndemocracy is testament to the power of our will and the \r\nmagnanimity of the world. We have celebrated three \r\npeaceful political transitions and seamless transfers of \r\npolitical power.\r\nThe new direction of my Government is focused \r\non building a just, peaceful, inclusive and fair Sierra \r\nLeone. Our nation is at peace. My Government will \r\ncontinue to open up democratic spaces and promote \r\nnational conversations on consolidating peace in our \r\nnation. My Government will soon launch a presidential \r\ninitiative that will convene a national conference on \r\npeacebuilding, diversity management and the rebuilding \r\nof national cohesion. As President Mandela showed \r\nus, we should get together, talk to one another, listen \r\nto one another and continue to consolidate the peace \r\nour nation enjoys. We will work with our Parliament \r\nto establish an independent commission for peace and \r\nnational cohesion.\r\nSierra Leone believes that Madiba Mandela’s \r\nlegacy to all of us is great. It belongs to every one of \r\nus who is working for social justice, inclusion, peaceful \r\ncoexistence and equality in Africa, Europe, Asia, the \r\nAmericas and Australia. His legacy demonstrates that \r\nwe should be bold and resolute and persevere in the \r\nstruggle for peace, justice and inclusion. Only then can \r\nwe fashion a future based on humanity.\r\nFinally, let me end by saying that Sierra Leone \r\nrecognizes and will continue to promote President \r\nNelson Mandela’s legacy. Sierra Leone therefore joins \r\nthe consensus on today’s declaration because we believe \r\nin the values and principles enshrined in it.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Aloysio Nunes, Minister for External \r\nRelations of the Federative Republic of Brazil.\r\nMr. Nunes (Brazil) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express my thanks to my South \r\nAfrican colleague for having proposed this conference \r\nto mark the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. \r\nMandela’s legacy inspires us and brings us together, \r\nwherever we are across the world, and Brazil is no \r\nexception. We had the honour in recent days to host an \r\nexhibition on the life of Mandela at Brazil’s External \r\nRelations headquarters in Brasilia, with the help of the \r\nApartheid Museum. The exhibition bears witness to the \r\nlife of Mandela — a life that was entirely devoted to \r\naffirming human dignity in South Africa and beyond.\r\nThe commemoration of the life of Nelson Mandela \r\nenables us to reiterate the fact that peace can be built \r\nonly through dialogue and that it is possible to have \r\ndialogue thanks to our common humanity. The path \r\nis sometimes long, but resorting to violence cannot \r\nreplace dialogue. South Africa, when it emerged from \r\napartheid, was a deeply wounded society because of \r\nits divisions and the lack of links among the various \r\ngroups that composed it. Mandela himself had been a \r\nvictim of the cruelties imposed by that odious regime. \r\nHe called upon his people to change that reality in order \r\nto make reconciliation possible. His dream brought \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n42/86 18-29599\r\ntogether South Africans around a collective project \r\nbased on democracy, human rights and development.\r\nNelson Mandela was the founding father of a great \r\nnation. In him one can also see the classical character of \r\na man at the helm of the universal mission of peace. We \r\ncan learn lessons from his efforts, which can guide us \r\nin facing the reality of our time. The peaceful tradition \r\nof my country, Brazil, enables us to make an important \r\ncontribution to international peace and security. \r\nBrazil is proud to have been involved in the dialogue \r\non peacebuilding that was led by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We support the integrated strategies aimed \r\nat the prevention and resolution of conflict, as well as \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. We are also of the \r\nview that international peace and security, development \r\nand human rights are closely intertwined and mutually \r\nreinforcing, without confusing the role and capacities \r\nof the pillars of the United Nations.\r\nThe declaration that we adopted today (resolution \r\n73/1) reaffirms the primacy of dialogue as the only way \r\nto build sustainable peace. The declaration also renews \r\nour conviction of the value of the peaceful settlement \r\nof conflicts, as well as disarmament with a view to \r\nachieving the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. \r\nIf we are to honour the memory of Nelson Mandela, \r\nwe must remain fully committed to peace, despite \r\nthe difficulties that we face along the way. Mandela \r\nchallenged the simple opposition between realism and \r\nidealism. He said that things always seem impossible \r\nuntil they are done. It is that spirit that we must keep in \r\nmind as a source of inspiration.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele \r\nMalielegaoi, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Trade of the Independent State of Samoa.\r\nMr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): Today we come together \r\nas leaders and representatives of nations united by a \r\ncommon cause, namely, to celebrate and remember the \r\nlegacy of Nelson Mandela — a truly self less leader, \r\nwhose life personified humility and forgiveness, \r\nand was underpinned by a dedication to service for \r\nhumankind and the promotion of peace.\r\nOur Summit is timely. It sends us all a resounding \r\nmessage that peace and harmony remain elusive. The \r\nworld we live in is a war-torn tapestry of conflict-\r\nridden countries; regions battered by climate change \r\nand marked by natural disasters, suffering from \r\nunshakeable poverty, discrimination and intolerance of \r\ndiversity. Our efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development will be an insurmountable \r\ntask — even with the best of will and intentions — if \r\nwe do not commit ourselves to resolving these conflicts \r\nand create conditions conducive to sustaining peace.\r\nAs leaders, our ultimate goal and responsibility \r\nare the promotion of a peaceful and prosperous world, \r\ncoexisting without fear of being different or suffering \r\nas a consequence of such differences. These aspirations \r\nare enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations — our \r\nOrganization, whose primary purpose is to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security. These aspirations are \r\nwoven into our 2030 Agenda. Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 16 requires us to promote peaceful and inclusive \r\nsocieties for sustainable development. This noble aim \r\nwas long recognized, as reaffirmed in the purposes \r\nand principles of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, which marks its seventieth anniversary this year.\r\nLiving together in peace is about bridging gender \r\ninequality, and I highlight the important role of women, \r\nyouth and children as agents of peace, recognizing their \r\nsignificant contributions to sustainable development \r\nand peace. Peace starts at home, and women must be \r\nfree from gender-based violence. As wives, mothers and \r\nsisters, women play an indispensable role in teaching, \r\nnurturing and inculcating the values of peace at home.\r\nPeace and development are inseparable and \r\nindivisible. I will strongly reaffirm that, without peace, \r\nthere is no development; and without development, there \r\nis no peace. Today we acknowledge the importance \r\nof transforming our world by achieving the 2030 \r\nAgenda, which we designed to create a peaceful and \r\nprosperous society.\r\nLiving together in peace means a society that \r\nworks together in constructing partnerships to foster a \r\nculture of peace so that our global family can succeed \r\nin our collective aspiration towards eradicating poverty \r\nso that no one is left behind. We can attain global peace \r\nthrough cooperation, mediation and dialogue. We can \r\nbegin by pursuing global understanding and respect \r\nthroughout all generations to come. After all, Nelson \r\nMandela steadfastly believed that peace is the greatest \r\nweapon for development that any person can have.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Abdelkader Messahel, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria.\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 43/86\r\nMr. Messahel (Algeria) (spoke in French): It is a \r\ngreat honour for me to address the General Assembly \r\nat this historic Summit, marking the centennial \r\ncelebration of the African icon Nelson Mandela.\r\nNelson Mandela, a symbol of the struggle against \r\napartheid in South Africa and a Nobel Peace Prize \r\nlaureate, dedicated his life to the just cause of his \r\npeople, to which devoted himself tirelessly on the \r\nremarkable journey he undertook with humility. As \r\nPresident Abdelaziz Bouteflika has said,\r\n“Nelson Mandela is integral to the history \r\nof South Africa, embodying its long struggle for \r\nfreedom and dignity. His fight against the apartheid \r\nsystem and to rehabilitate human beings in all \r\ntheir dignity inspired the Algerian people in their \r\nown fight.”\r\nNelson Mandela was a faithful friend of Algeria and \r\nis part and parcel of our history. It is with great pride that I \r\nrecall Mandela’s declaration that the National Liberation \r\nArmy and the Algerian people had inspired his struggle \r\nfor freedom and that Algeria, which made him a man, \r\nwas like a second home to him. Representatives will \r\ncertainly recall that the United Nations membership of \r\nthe apartheid regime was suspended during the course \r\nof the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly, \r\nunder the presidency of Algeria’s President Abdelaziz \r\nBouteflika, the Minister for Foreign Affairs at that \r\ntime, and the African National Congress was accorded \r\nthe status of observer to the United Nations through \r\nwhat is known as the Bouteflika ruling.\r\nAbove and beyond his belonging to Africa, whose \r\nvirtues, humanist values and pan-African ideals \r\nhe embodied, Nelson Mandela was an exemplary \r\nchampion of human rights and the rights of peoples to \r\nself-determination, which is a key driving force for the \r\nprevalence of peace and freedom throughout the world. \r\nHis work to promote reconciliation, gender equality, \r\nthe rights of children and other persons in vulnerable \r\nsituations, and the defence of poor and underdeveloped \r\ncommunities will remain rooted in the history of \r\nhumankind and an inspiration to the United Nations.\r\nToday’s commemoration must therefore pay \r\ntribute to Mandela’s long political struggle for the \r\nright of peoples to self-determination. We welcome the \r\nproclamation of the period 2019-2028 as the Nelson \r\nMandela Peace Decade, and we endorse the call on all \r\nMember States to redouble their efforts to guarantee \r\ninternational peace, security, development and human \r\nrights over the course of the Decade.\r\nI conclude by saying that it is incumbent upon all of \r\nus to make Mandela’s rainbow dream a reality that will \r\nallow us all to express our profound desire to live and \r\nact together, united by our differences and diversity, \r\nin order to build a sustainable world based on peace, \r\nsolidarity and harmony. It is precisely that desire that \r\nunderpinned the initiative launched by Algeria and \r\nother African countries here a year ago to proclaim \r\n16 May each year the International Day of Living \r\nTogether in Peace.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Sidiki Kaba, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Senegalese Abroad of the Republic \r\nof Senegal.\r\nMr. Kaba (Senegal) (spoke in French): It is a \r\ngreat honour and a privilege for me to represent the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal, His Excellency \r\nMr. Macky Sall, at this important Summit, which exalts \r\nour shared universal values as embodied by one of \r\nthe most illustrious men in history, President Nelson \r\nMandela. Through this Summit, we are reaffirming our \r\ncommon devotion to President Mandela, who, through \r\nhis commitment to and struggle for human dignity, \r\nmade his mark on history and remains a model for our \r\nfuture. In a world constantly seeking meaning, there \r\nis no opportunity more fitting than the centenary of \r\nMandela’s birth for us to dwell on his exceptional and \r\nmultidimensional legacy as an inexhaustible source \r\nof inspiration for us to find answers to the multiple \r\nchallenges we currently face in bringing peace, justice \r\nand prosperity to our world.\r\nAnother happy coincidence is the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights, whose founding principles enshrine \r\nfreedom and equal dignity among human beings. Indeed, \r\nconflicts between nations have declined considerably \r\nand the world has become more prosperous. Hope has \r\nbeen further heightened by the ongoing implementation \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nHowever, more than seven decades after the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations, the international \r\ncommunity continues to face unprecedented perils that \r\nhinder peace and security at a time when multilateralism \r\nis under severe strain. These political, security and \r\nsocioeconomic challenges include, inter alia, poverty \r\nand exclusion, violent extremism and terrorism, illicit \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n44/86 18-29599\r\ntrafficking and the rise of nationalism, intolerance and \r\nracism. These acutely affect young people and women, \r\nespecially in Africa. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\nremains unresolved, despite the clear parameters set by \r\nthe international community to that end.\r\nTherefore, the teachings of President \r\nMandela — focusing on dialogue, consultation, open-\r\nmindedness and respect for others — remain more \r\nrelevant than ever if we are to achieve international \r\npeace and security, especially by prioritizing prevention \r\nand mediation. Did he not often urge us to work for the \r\npower of ideas to triumph over bloodshed? By drawing \r\non his legacy, we must carry on his struggle for the \r\nrespect and promotion of human rights, dignity, equality, \r\ndemocracy and a culture of peace throughout the world. \r\nThese values,  enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, must unite us here within the Organization.\r\nIn August 1987, Senegal hosted the first meeting \r\nbetween white South African players from various \r\nbackgrounds and a delegation of the African National \r\nCongress led by President Thabo Mbeki, thereby \r\ndemonstrating its unwavering commitment to ending \r\napartheid through dialogue and consultations. We \r\nenjoyed widespread national support in this objective. \r\nWe must now work to ensure that the contents of the \r\npolitical declaration (resolution 73/1) that we have just \r\nadopted — which is inspired by the life and work of our \r\nillustrious Elder and proclaims the period 2019-2028 \r\nas the Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace — are shared \r\nglobally and can serve as a handbook for each of us.\r\nIn promoting the values enshrined by President \r\nMandela, Senegal remains steadfast in its commitment \r\nto peace and will continue working for a peaceful world \r\nin the light of the Ubuntu philosophy of living together \r\nin harmony. Together, we can tear down the walls of \r\nseparation and, together, we must build bridges of \r\nfriendship and fraternity among our peoples.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Pravind Kumar \r\nJugnauth, Prime Minister, Minister for Home Affairs, \r\nExternal Communications and National Development \r\nUnit, Minister for Finance and Economic Development \r\nof the Republic of Mauritius.\r\nMr. Jugnauth (Mauritius): As we gather today \r\nto reflect on global peace together, let us learn from \r\nMadiba and his extraordinary personal character and \r\nfierce principles, which allowed him to strive for justice \r\nfor his people.\r\nMauritius was privileged to host the late President \r\nMandela twice while he was in office and several times \r\nafter he stepped down. In recognition of his towering \r\nmoral authority, Mauritius inaugurated the Nelson \r\nMandela Cultural Centre as early as 1986. His values of \r\ntruth and reconciliation serve as the basis for our own \r\ndrive to promote unity in diversity. As a country that \r\nwas built on slavery and indentured labour, Mauritius \r\nseeks to promote an inclusive society, respectful of \r\nhuman rights and proud of its African, Indian, Chinese \r\nand European heritage.\r\nMadiba’s empathy and generosity of spirit allowed \r\nhim to forgive his enemies and reach out to make \r\nenduring peace for his country, despite the hardships he \r\nsuffered. Madiba never lost sight of what was important, \r\nwhich is peace and social justice for all. A mediator \r\npar excellence, he used his status as an elder statesman \r\nto further the cause of peace and social justice, even \r\nafter he stepped down as President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa. His whole life showcases the strength \r\nof the weak, which, when leaning on the principles of \r\na righteous cause, is capable of transforming diverse \r\ninjustices and violence into peace and justice.\r\nWe as global leaders must do likewise — reach out \r\nand build bridges for the betterment of humankind. \r\nLet him be an inspiration to us even today as we \r\nsee a re-emergence of intolerance and xenophobia \r\nworldwide. Peace is fragile. We must show strength and \r\nrise to the challenge. As we subscribe to the political \r\ndeclaration (resolution 73/1) and support the call for the \r\nNelson Mandela Decade of Peace today, we must strive \r\nto ensure the endurance of his legacy by our actions. \r\nLet us learn from Madiba’s legacy.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Régis Immongault Tatangani, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Cooperation, Francophonie and \r\nRegional Integration of the Republic of Gabon.\r\nMr. Immongault Tatangani (Gabon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): It is an honour for me to speak on behalf of \r\nthe Gabonese President, His Excellency Mr. Ali Bongo \r\nOndimba, at this Peace Summit, which pays a fitting \r\ntribute to the work and ideals defended by Nelson \r\nMandela. That illustrious man left his mark on the \r\nhistory of humankind through his leadership and sense \r\nof duty.\r\nThe Gabonese people will never forget his first \r\nvisit as a free man. He set foot on Gabonese soil on \r\n14 February 1991, just three days after his release \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 45/86\r\nfrom prison. Gabon and Mandela have always shared a \r\ncommitment to peace. It is therefore a real pleasure for \r\nme to take part in this Nelson Mandela Peace Summit, \r\nwhich I have no doubt will continue to perpetuate the \r\nlegacy of that Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\r\nOur planet continues to be plagued by a large \r\nnumber of conflicts and latent crises that require strong \r\nworld leadership with the ability to think outside the \r\nbox and provide new and bold solutions that promote \r\nlasting peace. There are many situations in which \r\npeace remains fragile, despite the significant advances \r\nour Organization has made in defusing conflict and \r\nestablishing and consolidating peace. We have many \r\nmechanisms in place, including the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, the Human Rights Council, the United \r\nNations Democracy Fund and various peacekeeping \r\noperations. In addition, in recent years our Organization \r\nhas increased its development efforts to better combat \r\npoverty and social exclusion, which are, as we all \r\nknow, major sources of tension. Our Organization has \r\nimportant tools at its disposal for the promotion of \r\npeace and international security.\r\nOne might wonder why crises and conflicts persist. \r\nAre we sufficiently invested in the quest for peace? Are \r\nwe capable, at this rate, of establishing just, peaceful, \r\nprosperous and inclusive societies by 2030? For Gabon, \r\nthe main difficulty lies in our ability to make the most \r\nof the mechanisms at our disposal. We must therefore \r\nmaintain and adapt our efforts to the changes and threats \r\nto peace and security. The world is changing fast, as \r\nis the nature of conflict; it is therefore imperative to \r\nadapt our mechanisms for promoting and consolidating \r\npeace.\r\nTo that end, my country supports the ongoing reforms \r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General to improve and \r\nadapt the United Nations peacebuilding architecture. \r\nGabon has often underlined the importance of the \r\nUnited Nations adopting more effective prevention \r\ntools adapted to current situations. We must step up our \r\nefforts in terms of prevention. The establishment of the \r\nCentral African Early Warning Mechanism, responsible \r\nfor analysing the risks and evolution of crises and \r\ntheir causes, as well as for seeking solutions, is part \r\nof this approach. The Council for Peace and Security \r\nin Central Africa advocates preventive diplomacy and \r\nmediation, which are strongly endorsed by the States of \r\nthe subregion, including Gabon. That is also reflected \r\nin Gabon’s deployment of a contingent to the United \r\nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \r\nMission in the Central African Republic.\r\nThe efforts of the United Nations, including those \r\nthat have led to the strengthening of the Group of \r\nFriends of Mediation, deserve recognition. I welcome \r\nthe proposed approach that includes the three pillars \r\nof the United Nations from a conflict-prevention \r\nperspective. In order to be effective, prevention and, \r\nat the very least, mediation must be predictable and \r\nadequate financing. Furthermore, because they have \r\nin-depth knowledge on the ground, the involvement \r\nof regional and subregional organizations and civil \r\nsociety is also essential. It should be recalled that \r\norganizations such as the African Union, the Economic \r\nCommunity of Central African States and the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States have in many cases \r\nhelped to defuse political crises, promote the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and encourage the signing of \r\npeace agreements.\r\nI would like to conclude by emphasizing the \r\nimportance of paying particular attention to security \r\nrisks and threats related to the effects of climate change. \r\nDesertification, drought, the extreme variability \r\nof rainfall and the recurrence of f loods and storms \r\ncontribute significantly to the decline of resources and \r\ncan generate new conflicts and increase the number of \r\nclimate refugees. These dynamics will certainly have \r\nan impact on vulnerable regions, such as the Horn of \r\nAfrica and the Sahel.\r\nIn order to address them, mechanisms for conflict \r\nprevention and the promotion of peace and security \r\nof the United Nations, as well as of regional and \r\nsubregional organizations, must be subject to the \r\nnecessary adaptation and resilience. In this regard, I \r\nwelcome the holding of a Security Council debate on \r\nclimate change and its implications for international \r\npeace and security on 11 July (S/PV.8307). Climate \r\ndisruption is a pressing issue that we must address with \r\nthe necessary attention and determination. The survival \r\nof our world is at stake.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jorge Arreaza, Minister of the People’s \r\nPower for Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela.\r\nMr. Arreaza (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): It is a great honour for the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela to speak on behalf \r\nof the 120 States members of the Movement of \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n46/86 18-29599\r\nNon-Aligned Countries at this historic Peace Summit \r\nto commemorate the centenary of Nelson Mandela’s \r\nbirth.\r\nAt the 18th Mid-Term Ministerial Meeting of \r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, held in \r\nApril in the city of Baku, ministers adopted a special \r\ndeclaration to commemorate the centenary of the birth \r\nof Nelson Mandela, in which they urge the international \r\ncommunity to seize that opportunity to redouble their \r\nefforts aimed at tackling the challenges posed by \r\npoverty and underdevelopment and to promote the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, inter alia.\r\nThe ministers also took that opportunity to \r\nreaffirm that the life lessons of Nelson Mandela are \r\naligned with the fundamental principles, values and \r\nobjectives of the Non-Aligned Movement. These \r\nprinciples are mutual respect for the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of others; the non-use of force; \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States; \r\nequality, mutual benefit, peaceful coexistence and the \r\nresolution of international controversies by peaceful \r\nmeans. Moreover, we cannot overemphasize the role \r\nand leadership of Nelson Mandela, together with our \r\nMovement, over which he presided in 1998 and 1999, in \r\nthe fight against colonialism, racial discrimination and \r\napartheid, especially in South Africa, whose liberation \r\nconstituted a decisive milestone in the history of our \r\nMovement.\r\nNelson Mandela is one of the greatest leaders of \r\nour time. His legacy remains a source of inspiration \r\nthrough his example of courage, service, forgiveness, \r\nreconciliation and compassion. In this regard, and \r\nperhaps most importantly, in order to honour his legacy \r\nwe must translate our words into actions. As Nelson \r\nMandela himself said in 2004, “Peace is not just the \r\nabsence of conflict”. We must therefore step up our \r\nefforts at the global level to establish conditions leading \r\nto sustainable peace and to promote a genuine culture \r\nof peace, including, inter alia, through the effective \r\nmanagement of protracted crises, the root causes of \r\nterrorism and extremism, poverty in every shape and \r\nform, discrimination and xenophobia, intolerance and \r\nsocial injustices of every kind.\r\nIn that regard, the States members of the \r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries, faithful to their \r\ncommitment to strengthening their role and position as \r\nan anti-war and peace-loving force and to establishing \r\na peaceful and prosperous world, as well as a fair and \r\nequitable world order, believe that the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development provides a framework for \r\naction in favour of people, humankind, the planet and \r\nprosperity in which no one is left behind and that seeks \r\nto achieve universal peace as a greater freedom. At the \r\nsame time, we recognize that the eradication of poverty \r\nin all its forms and manifestations, including extreme \r\npoverty, constitutes the greatest global challenge and \r\nprerequisite for achieving sustainable development. \r\nToday, we therefore take this opportunity to renew our \r\ncommitment to the full and effective implementation \r\nof this beautiful 2030 Agenda to reaffirm our pledge to \r\nleave no one behind.\r\nMoreover, we also reiterate our commitment to \r\nhonouring the legacy of Nelson Mandela and keeping \r\nhis principles alive, including those of solidarity and \r\ndisinterested dedication to the service of humankind, \r\nparticularly in the spheres of conflict resolution, \r\ninterracial relations, the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights, reconciliation, gender equality, the rights \r\nof the child and other vulnerable groups, the fight for \r\ndemocracy at the international level and the promotion \r\nof a culture of peace throughout the world on behalf of \r\nthe poorest and most underdeveloped communities.\r\nMr. Greenidge (Guyana), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nIn conclusion, the Non-Aligned Movement awaits \r\nwith great interest the various initiatives and activities \r\nto be undertaken during the Nelson Mandela Decade of \r\nPeace 2019-2028. We also appeal to the international \r\ncommunity to actively engage in that regard. We \r\nare committed, just as Madiba was, to building a \r\ncomprehensive, fair and lasting peace. Let us do so for \r\npresent and future generations.\r\nIf I may, in my national capacity on behalf of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, it is a privilege \r\nfor us to be part of this tribute and the adoption of \r\nresolution 73/1 for Nelson Mandela. Madiba is part of \r\nthe founding benchmark of the Bolivarian revolution \r\nand of everything beautiful that humankind represents. \r\nFor us, this is not an act of diplomacy or of hypocrisy; \r\nwe are not pretending or posing. We are paying tribute \r\nto one of our fathers, Nelson Mandela — a man of \r\nsolidarity, a man of equality, a socialist in the best \r\nsense of the word, a complete socialist who fought for \r\npeace and for the beauty in humankind.\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 47/86\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Sushma Swaraj, Minister of External Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of India.\r\nMs. Swaraj (India): I feel privileged to be attending \r\nthis event to commemorate the life and contributions of \r\nNelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela’s life is an inspiration \r\nto all. He showed fearless courage in the face of \r\ndiscrimination and adversity. The values espoused \r\nby him — forgiveness and compassion, as well as the \r\ninclusiveness of society — are needed now more than \r\never in these turbulent times around the world.\r\nWe Indians consider Madiba to be one of our own. \r\nWe are proud to call him a Bharat Ratna — a jewel of \r\nIndia. India cherishes its special relationship and long-\r\nstanding partnership with Africa and its people. Our \r\nclose bonds are reflected in the philosophy of Mandela \r\nand Mahatma Gandhi, father of our nation. Both led \r\ntheir peoples to freedom through mass peaceful \r\nstruggles. They made every effort to overcome divisive \r\nand narrow identity politics and to turn the diversity of \r\nour societies into their strength instead of a weakness.\r\nAt the United Nations in 1994, Nelson Mandela \r\nsaid that “the society we seek to create must be a \r\npeople-centred society; all its institutions and its \r\nresources must be dedicated to the pursuit of a better \r\nlife for all our citizens.” (A/49/PV.14, p. 8). These words \r\nare all the more relevant today.\r\nOur world is still beset with conflicts, terror and \r\nhateful ideologies that transcend borders and impact \r\nour lives. No one should be allowed to support terror \r\nor its perpetration. Our collective survival as a global \r\nfamily requires the wisdom of pioneering leaders, \r\nsuch as Mandela, to remain our moral compass. Let us \r\nshare this planet as one. Let us make a better world for \r\nour children.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Jorge Marcelo Faurie, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Worship of the Argentine Republic.\r\nMr. Faurie (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): It is an \r\nhonour for Argentina to speak at this Peace Summit, \r\nwhich provides us with the opportunity to recognize \r\nthe dedication of President Mandela to the service of \r\nhumankind. Argentina reaffirms its respect for the \r\ntremendous experience and values that are embodied \r\nby Nelson Mandela and characterize his life: a vision \r\nof the dignity of humankind, a struggle against racial \r\ndiscrimination and injustices, and all his ongoing \r\nefforts to promote democracy and a culture of peace.\r\nNelson Mandela continues to be an inspiration \r\nfor all those who are part of this Organization, above \r\nall thanks to his teaching and his support for the \r\nreconciliation of peoples and for his defence of the \r\npoorest and most vulnerable communities. Mandela \r\nwas a unique statesman because he converted his words \r\ninto actions and showed that true leaders must always \r\nbe willing to sacrifice everything for the freedom of \r\ntheir people. As States Members of the Organization, \r\nwe are all responsible for promoting and protecting the \r\nhuman rights of our peoples.\r\nFollowing the path carved by Mandela, I believe that \r\nwe must work actively to stamp out all manifestations \r\nof discrimination and intolerance and, above all, we \r\nmust foster education through democracy and learn to \r\nresolve conflicts peacefully. Armed conflicts constitute \r\na threat to the respect and enjoyment of human rights. \r\nThey jeopardize and compromise the right to life, \r\nfreedom, individual security and the freedoms of \r\nexpression, association, thought, conscience and \r\nreligion. Conflicts create conditions that lead to serious \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law, such as \r\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.\r\nArgentina, as an active member of the international \r\ncommunity, reaffirms its steadfast commitment to \r\ndefending human rights and to maintaining international \r\npeace and security. We are striving to raise awareness of \r\nhuman suffering and the need to provide humanitarian \r\nassistance, especially to those regions that are seriously \r\naffected by conflict situations.\r\nNelson Mandela has been a key figure in our \r\ntwentieth century and his enormous valour and \r\ncommitment will always serve as examples for future \r\ngenerations. Before concluding, I wish to recall some \r\nof Mandela’s inspiring words when he reminded us all \r\nthat death is inevitable and that, when a man has done \r\nwhat he considers to be his duty to his people and his \r\ncountry, he can rest in peace. He said of himself: “I \r\nbelieve I have made that effort and that is, therefore, why \r\nI will sleep for eternity”. Two words have always been \r\npresent here — forgiveness and reconciliation — as \r\nwell as peace. They sum up his legacy and what we \r\nshould remember in honouring Nelson Mandela.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Aurelia Frick, Minister for Foreign \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n48/86 18-29599\r\nAffairs, Justice and Culture of the Principality of \r\nLiechtenstein.\r\nMs. Frick (Liechtenstein): I was a very young \r\nwoman when Nelson Mandela was released from Robben \r\nIsland. It is a moment that sticks out in my memory as \r\nan example of fortitude and a triumph over adversity \r\nand injustice. After he had been unfairly imprisoned for \r\n27 years, Madiba’s abiding and dignified commitment \r\nto justice quickly became an inspiration to all and has \r\nremained so to this day.\r\nNelson Mandela’s commitment to justice and \r\nreconciliation stands out in his legacy. More than anyone \r\nhe embodied the belief that the rule of law is the key to \r\na world of peace and that justice can and will prevail. \r\nWe in Liechtenstein believe that justice is essential to \r\novercoming oppression and creating sustainable peace. \r\nWe therefore fight for a strong system of international \r\ncriminal justice with the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) at its core. In fact, we see Mandela’s lifelong \r\nfight reflected in the ICC’s founding document. Article \r\n7 of the Rome Statute cites the crime of apartheid as a \r\ncrime against humanity and therefore one of the worst \r\npossible human rights violations. African countries \r\nwere at the forefront of pressing for a permanent \r\nindependent international criminal court. And as \r\nMandela said himself, his own continent had suffered \r\nenough horrors arising from the inhumanity of human \r\nbeings towards others. Who knows if many of them \r\nmight not have occurred or might at least have been \r\nminimized had there been an effectively functioning \r\ninternational criminal court?\r\nNelson Mandela also demonstrated that justice \r\nmeans dealing with past abuses in a way that can lead to \r\na fairer and more peaceful world. While it is essential \r\nto prosecute the most serious crimes, justice must \r\nalso be restorative even for the worst crimes known \r\nto humanity. It should provide opportunities for those \r\naffected to heal the wounds created by conflict and \r\nrebuild society rather than becoming trapped in a cycle \r\nof violence, retribution and punishment.\r\nIt is also the pursuit of peace that will enable us \r\nto deliver on Nelson Mandela’s legacy. This year, we \r\nwill build on it by bringing into force the Kampala \r\namendments on the crime of aggression, according \r\nto which leaders who wage aggressive war can \r\nbe prosecuted before the ICC. By taking this step \r\npenalizing illegal warfare, States have made another \r\nessential contribution to a world of sustainable peace \r\nthrough justice. We can prevent powerful people from \r\ncommitting any more of the crimes that Madiba had \r\nto suffer through, and we can create a more secure, \r\npeaceful and just world for future generations. I hope \r\nthat he will be proud of our efforts to create such \r\na world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Eldirdiri Mohamed Ahmed, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Sudan.\r\nMr. Ahmed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank our sister Republic of \r\nSouth Africa for organizing this important Summit \r\nto honour the centenary of the birth of its late leader \r\nNelson Mandela. I would also like to thank all of those \r\nwho worked to ensure that the Summit could take \r\nplace, particularly the former President of the General \r\nAssembly and the Permanent Representatives of South \r\nAfrica and Ireland, who facilitated the negotiations \r\nthat enabled the Assembly to adopt today’s political \r\ndeclaration (resolution 73/1).\r\nThe Sudan is taking part in this Summit to reaffirm \r\nits commitment to the noble values that the late leader \r\nNelson Mandela fought for, especially freedom, full \r\nequality and non-discrimination on the basis of a \r\nperson’s colour, ethnicity, religion or the other factors \r\nthat some use to discriminate against their brethren \r\nin humanity. For indeed it is God who created human \r\nbeings equal in rights and obligations and placed them \r\nabove all other creatures. In the Qur’an, God says:\r\n“We have honoured the sons of Adam; provided \r\nthem with transport on land and sea; given them \r\nfor sustenance things good and pure; and conferred \r\non them special favours, above a great part of our \r\ncreation.” (XVII, 70)\r\nThe Sudan believed in the cause for which Nelson \r\nMandela fought and for which he and his brothers \r\nand sisters who struggled with him paid a very heavy \r\nprice. In the 1960s the Government of the Sudan hosted \r\nhim and granted him a Sudanese passport — the first \r\npassport he ever held — to assist him in his efforts, and \r\nlater spread its help to many other African liberation \r\nmovements. That struggle culminated in the attainment \r\nof freedom and independence and in eliminating the \r\napartheid regime in South Africa, the most heinous \r\nsystem in contemporary history.\r\nThe active participation of Member States from all \r\nover the world in today’s Summit is full proof that the \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 49/86\r\nvalues for which Mandela struggled are universal, and \r\nthat humankind unquestionably needs them today in \r\norder to deal with the major threats facing our world. \r\nWe are in dire need of the values of forgiveness and \r\ntolerance that Mandela embodied in his aim of achieving \r\npeace, national reconciliation and peaceful coexistence \r\namong the various sectors of society while eliminating \r\nxenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiments, as well as \r\nneo-Nazism. We also need to underscore the values \r\nof equality, promote and maintain human rights and \r\nprotect society’s vulnerable sectors within democracy. \r\nThe aim is to build a better future in which human \r\nbeings can live on an equal footing and in dignity, on the \r\nbasis of justice between large and small States, free of \r\nintolerance and narrow populism, while strengthening \r\nthe opportunities for developing countries to attain the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. If we can do that, we \r\nwill have done humankind the greatest possible service \r\nand made the centenary of Nelson Mandela’s birth an \r\nevent that people will remember  forever.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rodolfo Nin Novoa, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay.\r\nMr. Nin Novoa (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): As \r\nwe commemorate the 100th anniversary of Nelson \r\nMandela’s birth, the world is in a deteriorating situation \r\nwith respect to international peace and security. Wars, \r\nfamines, racism and xenophobia, to mention just some \r\nof the calamities that human beings are inflicting on \r\ntheir fellows, presage a future plagued by difficulties \r\nthat are increasingly difficult to tackle simultaneously \r\nat a time when solidarity, tolerance and empathy appear \r\nto be retreating before what are clearly growing trends \r\ntowards individualism, intolerance and indifference to \r\nthe fate of others.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, the iconic figure and \r\nimperishable legacy of this fighter for peace, democracy, \r\ntolerance and humanism are more relevant today than \r\never. Nelson Mandela’s political and personal journey, \r\nmarked by his steadfast commitment to human rights, \r\nfreedom and brotherhood, is the best example of a \r\npolitical praxis that is coherent and consistent with \r\nthe values that should rule in relations between people \r\nand between States. We could not have chosen a figure \r\nwhose experience and political action could better \r\nsymbolize the magnitude of the challenges that the world \r\nis facing. Mandela was without a doubt a man ahead of \r\nhis time, a statesman with a profound understanding of \r\nthe complex nature of human beings who transformed \r\nforgiveness, reconciliation, acceptance of others and a \r\nculture of dialogue and concord into the fundamental \r\npillars for rebuilding a country, ethically and politically, \r\nthat had been devastated by decades of segregation, \r\nracism and inequality.\r\nLike no one else, he emphasized the dignity of \r\nhuman beings as central to political action, including in \r\nthe international arena. His generosity, and the fact that \r\nhe extended a hand to those who had unjustly deprived \r\nhim of liberty for 27 years, has been an example to \r\nthe world. Madiba was first and foremost an African, \r\nin the way he expressed himself and his pride for his \r\ntraditions, cultural roots and spiritual heritage. But at \r\nthe same time he projected himself as the most universal \r\nof modern political leaders, aware, as few are, that for \r\nhuman beings to be truly free they need their States to \r\nbe effectively and sincerely committed to peace, human \r\nrights and development.\r\nThe political declaration we have adopted at this \r\nspecial meeting today (resolution 73/1) focuses on the \r\nessential values that must unite us as civilized countries \r\nin fostering multilateralism and peaceful coexistence \r\nwhile always protecting the most vulnerable and \r\nstriving to ensure the conditions that people need to \r\ndevelop their abilities and talents freely and equally. \r\nRecognizing the period from 2019 to 2028 as the Nelson \r\nMandela Decade of Peace should be a turning point that \r\nwill commit us to taking action in order to achieve a \r\nworld that is more just, peaceful, democratic, equitable \r\nand inclusive, the world for which Mandela fought and \r\nthat our peoples and his tireless example demand of us.\r\nUruguay firmly supports the principles proclaimed \r\nin the political declaration — the defence of the sovereign \r\nequality of States, respect for the territorial integrity \r\nand independence of States and refraining from threats \r\nor the use of force in international relations — but \r\nabove all, we are unwaveringly committed to combating \r\nracism, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination and \r\nintolerance in order to build a more equitable, peaceful, \r\nprosperous and inclusive world. That is the best tribute \r\nthat my country can pay Nelson Mandela.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Siala, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation \r\nof the State of Libya.\r\nMr. Siala (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\non behalf of my Government I have the pleasure of \r\nexpressing my thanks and appreciation to the President \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n50/86 18-29599\r\nof the General Assembly for holding this high-level \r\nmeeting, the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit, which on \r\n23 January the General Assembly agreed to convene in \r\naccordance with resolution 72/243.\r\nThere has never been such a global consensus \r\non the status of a contemporary figure as on the \r\nlate Nelson Mandela, known as Madiba. Such \r\nattention to an important leader does not come from \r\nnowhere. Mandela’s history was full of sacrifices, \r\naccomplishments and dramatic changes. Perhaps \r\nthe most important was that he adopted a culture of \r\ntolerance and converted it into the kind of driving force \r\nthat we so badly need nowadays. He has been described \r\nas an icon of peace and tolerance and is considered a \r\nsymbol of freedom, and the transitional period of the \r\nRepublic of South Africa is testament to that. Great \r\nleaders are not born every day, and history is driven \r\nonly by those who have courage, strength, goodwill, \r\npatience and the ability to sacrifice and see things \r\ndifferently from others. Humankind lost one of those \r\ngreat leaders in Nelson Mandela, who lived for almost \r\na century, from 1918 to 2013.\r\nAs we all know, Madiba did not put himself above \r\nthe interests of his people; rather, he strived and did \r\neverything he could to bring about transformations \r\nand the sustainability of the common good. After \r\nentrenching the roots and mechanisms of national \r\nreconciliation between all ethnicities and races, he \r\nwould not permit the exclusion of or any injustice \r\ntowards the white minority that had controlled his \r\ncountry for centuries. He did not treat them as they had \r\ntreated the majority of people when they were in control. \r\nHis approach was one of conscience and firm principle, \r\naimed at improving the lives of ordinary people without \r\ndiscrimination in any way. He enshrined the concept \r\nof leadership as service — and with service come \r\nsacrifice and the delegation of power to others rather \r\nthan their marginalization, along with the engagement \r\nof society in political life so as to enable it to progress \r\nand develop.\r\nMy country feels a special appreciation for this \r\ngreat African leader. His struggle was not confined to \r\nhis country, South Africa. Rather, he felt the suffering \r\nand injustice sustained by all nations, particularly the \r\npeoples of Africa. That is why my country honoured \r\nNelson Mandela at a time, in 1989, when everyone \r\nwas shying away from him. Mandela in his turn was \r\na strong and major supporter of my country’s cause \r\nand helped to end the blockade against Libya’s Arab-\r\nAfrican people.\r\nThe legacy of Mandela will live on in Africa and \r\nall over the world. His life, so rich in political struggle \r\nand sacrifice, will be an example for millions across the \r\nworld. I hope that we can all take the time to realize the \r\nextent to which Mandela’s life has been an inspiration \r\nin our own lives, and the impact that it will have on \r\nthe lives of future generations, including their leaders. \r\nWhile he left us a world that is more just and free, let \r\nus commit to advancing towards his vision of unity, \r\nreconciliation, global peace, development, prosperity \r\nand a better life for everyone.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Khemais Jhinaoui, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Tunisia.\r\nMr. Jhinaoui (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): We meet \r\ntoday to commemorate the life of Nelson Mandela and \r\nto reflect on the struggles of this great leader, out of \r\nour appreciation for the sacrifices he made in order to \r\nuphold humankind’s shared principles and values of \r\nfreedom, dignity, equality and justice. Whenever we \r\nreflect on Nelson Mandela, a series of images comes \r\nto mind — images of a statesman who devoted his life \r\nto eliminating racial discrimination, defending human \r\nrights, achieving national reconciliation and spreading \r\npeace in our sister nation of South Africa and in the \r\nworld at large. Today Mandela’s intellectual and human \r\nlegacy lives on and inspires us. Tunisia welcomes the \r\nconsensus on the political declaration of the Nelson \r\nMandela Peace Summit (resolution 73/1), which helps \r\nto inspire us by declaring the period from 2019 to 2028 \r\na decade of peace, motivating us to work tirelessly \r\nto build a more just, peaceful, prosperous, fair and \r\ninclusive world and to uphold the common values that \r\nMadiba embodied for the sake of peace.\r\nOur world today is confronting enormous and \r\nrapidly evolving threats and challenges, widespread \r\nextremist violence and terrorism in many parts of \r\nthe globe and an upsurge in hate speech related to \r\nnationalism, intolerance, racism, unwillingness to \r\naccept others as well as frequent violations of human \r\nrights. Weak governance and a lack of social justice, \r\ndevelopment inequalities at both the national and \r\ninternational level, growing links between organized \r\ncrime in its various forms, climate change and other \r\nfactors all help to create a fertile breeding ground for \r\nthe further spread of such destructive threats.\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 51/86\r\nNow more than ever, we need to hold on to the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the noble objectives that inspired the \r\nfounders of our inclusive international Organization \r\nin San Francisco in the aftermath of the destruction \r\nwrought by the Second World War. We must commit \r\nto working to realize the purposes of the United \r\nNations, redoubling our efforts to build a just, peaceful, \r\nprosperous and inclusive world and reviving the values \r\nfor which Nelson Mandela stood, while ensuring \r\nthat human dignity is at the heart of our actions, as \r\nproclaimed in the political declaration we have adopted \r\ntoday. In that regard, as a country that has been a centre \r\nfor positive interaction among various civilizations \r\nfor more than 3,000 years, Tunisia emphasizes its \r\ncommitment to promoting the values of tolerance, \r\nmoderation, mutual respect and solidarity among our \r\npeoples and nations.\r\nTunisia has continued to underscore its commitment \r\nto a culture of peace, tolerance, dialogue and consensus \r\nin order to manage crises peacefully, as a strategic, \r\ncivilized choice. That has ensured that we have never \r\nseriously deviated from our democratic transition and \r\nearned us the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize — which we \r\nshared with the National Dialogue Quartet — honouring \r\nus with its praise for the constructive role that civil \r\nsociety has played in our country. Given our national \r\nexperience, now more than ever we need to base our \r\nefforts on Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter in \r\norder to improve the Organization’s effectiveness in \r\npeacefully settling conflicts and preventing new ones.\r\nIn our belief in the vital role of women as a force for \r\nchange, we want to reiterate the importance of women’s \r\nparticipation in the various preventive initiatives \r\ndesigned to promote our societies’ resilience. In that \r\ncontext, in August my country endorsed a national \r\naction plan for implementing resolution 1325 (2000) on \r\nwomen and peace and security. In its new Constitution \r\nof 2014, Tunisia introduced the concept of equality \r\namong women and men in the areas of rights and \r\nresponsibilities, and we have also enacted a progressive \r\nlaw on combating violence against women.\r\nI would like to reiterate that promoting the role of \r\nyoung people as a positive force for change must be at \r\nthe heart of our common efforts for peace at the United \r\nNations. We welcome the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in that regard, particularly his intention to \r\nlaunch a new United Nations youth strategy in order \r\nto promote our joint efforts to support that important \r\nsector of our societies. I would like to recall in the regard \r\na 1996 letter from Nelson Mandela in which he called \r\non young men and women to take on the responsibility \r\nof changing the world in order to improve people’s \r\nlives and affirmed that the future lies in young people’s \r\nhands. Let us continue our efforts not only to provide \r\nbetter opportunities for our young men and women \r\nbut also to promote their ability to lead and shoulder \r\nresponsibilities in order to create a better future for our \r\npeoples and our countries. Let us educate our youth \r\nand our societies as a whole on the legacy of Nelson \r\nMandela and the human values for which he fought. \r\nFor that reason, the Tunisian postal service has issued \r\na stamp in honour of Nelson Mandela’s centenary as a \r\nsymbol of our endeavours for Africa and the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Kairat Abdrakhmanov, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\r\nMr. Abdrakhmanov (Kazakhstan): I would \r\nfirst like to congratulate Her Excellency Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session, on her election to \r\nher high office and to wish her every success in leading \r\nthis body.\r\nNelson Mandela is indeed an icon and an exemplary \r\nworld figure whom we regard as one of the greatest \r\nmoral and political leaders of our time. His lifelong \r\ndedication to the service of humankind became a vital \r\nforce in global efforts for peace, justice and equality. \r\nI would like to express our sincere gratitude to the \r\ndelegations of Ireland and South Africa for successfully \r\nsteering the preparatory process of the draft political \r\ndeclaration reaffirming the values of Nelson Mandela, \r\nwhich we all share. I therefore join others in welcoming \r\nour adoption today of a historic political declaration \r\n(resolution 73/1), which should serve as a reminder to \r\nthe entire international community of the imperative \r\nfor human dignity and justice and the pursuit of \r\npeace through dialogue and reconciliation. We take \r\ninspiration from Mr. Mandela’s life, which was based \r\non mutual respect, goodwill and non-violent tools for \r\nfighting the many conflicts that are tearing apart the \r\nworld today. That dramatic escalation of conflicts \r\ntriggered by ethnic, religious, territorial and other \r\nfactors has led to a severe humanitarian crisis across \r\nthe globe. For peace to prevail, we must address all \r\nthe root causes not only of conflict but also of the \r\nother scourges that confront us, including terrorism, \r\nextremism, organized crime and human trafficking. \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n52/86 18-29599\r\nAnd we must eliminate severe poverty and deprivation, \r\nfood, water and energy insecurities and the threats of \r\nclimate change and weapons of mass destruction, all of \r\nwhich aggravate conflicts.\r\nIn its 26 years of independence, Kazakhstan has \r\nachieved important political, social, economic and \r\ndemocratic targets, thereby preserving the stability \r\nand well-being of its people. For my country — where \r\nmore than 100 ethnic groups, with eight different \r\nreligious denominations, live together in peace and \r\nharmony — maintaining inter-ethnic and interreligious \r\npeace at the national, regional and international levels \r\nis a top priority, and Kazakhstan has proved both its \r\ncommitment and its proficiency in preventive diplomacy, \r\nmediation and honest brokering by peacefully resolving \r\nmany conflicts.\r\nOur far-reaching commitment is embodied in \r\nthe 2016 anti-war manifesto created by Kazakhstan’s \r\nPresident, Nursultan Nazarbayev, entitled “The World. \r\nThe 21st Century”. It is a road map for peace that in many \r\nways converges with the Secretary-General’s message \r\nto the world through his new peace agenda, his plan \r\nof action on nuclear disarmament and his far-reaching \r\nreforms. Kazakhstan’s manifesto calls for the use of all \r\nthe available tools, from early-warning mechanisms, \r\nconflict prevention, diplomacy and mediation, \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding to development, \r\nand for capacity-building by all Member States. My \r\nPresident’s January 2017 policy address to the Security \r\nCouncil, entitled “Kazakhstan’s concept and vision for \r\nsustaining global partnerships for a secure, just and \r\nprosperous world” (see S/PV.7857), is another relevant \r\ntool to that end. It emphasizes several priorities aimed \r\nat preventing and ending military confrontation at the \r\nregional and global levels and creating a conflict-free \r\nworld by the time of the United Nations centenary, a \r\ngoal that we would like the international community to \r\nadopt as its own.\r\nAs Mr. Mandela himself often said, it is in our hands \r\nto create a better world. Using him as our guiding star, \r\nlet us resolve to relentlessly strive for a fair, peaceful \r\nand sustainable society in which all people live together \r\npeacefully and with equal opportunities and where no \r\none is left behind. Let us recall all the promises that \r\nwe have made in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the \r\nnew agenda for sustaining peace (A/72/707). Only our \r\ncollective will and solidarity as Member States can turn \r\na world in crisis into a world of great hope and promise \r\nlike the one that Mr. Mandela dreamed of.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ivica Dačić, First Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia.\r\nMr. Dačić (Serbia) (spoke in Serbian; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I am greatly \r\nhonoured to attend the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit \r\nhere at United Nations Headquarters in New York, all \r\nthe more so as it is held in honour of Nelson Mandela, \r\nan exceptional man and a symbol of the struggle for \r\na just world, as well as a great warrior for peace. The \r\nSummit, held just before the general debate of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session and in \r\nhonour of the centenary of Mr. Mandela’s birth, will \r\nhelp us to make a more than symbolic contribution to the \r\nconstructive atmosphere that we need to make progress \r\nin realizingthe goals of the United Nations, including \r\nthe most precious among them, that of world peace.\r\nAs a successor State to the Socialist Federal Republic \r\nof Yugoslavia, Serbia is proud of the role played by \r\nYugoslavia and President Tito in the establishment of the \r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries. The Movement \r\nhas played an important role in the struggle against \r\napartheid and for decolonization, while also investing \r\ncontinued effort in promoting the economic and social \r\nstatus of underdeveloped and developing countries.\r\nWhile the world may be undergoing rapid change \r\ntoday, many of the goals close to the heart of Nelson \r\nMandela, a stalwart supporter of peace, continue to \r\nprevail. We must work even more diligently to promote \r\npeace, reconciliation, unity, non-discrimination, \r\nprotection and human rights. Our world today is \r\ngrappling with various threats and challenges and is \r\nquickly becoming a very different place from what \r\nit once was. We are witnessing myriad crises, whose \r\nnature and consequences are often complex and \r\ninterconnected, and we should therefore join forces in \r\nthe quest for global responses.\r\nFor us in Serbia, the importance of the place and role \r\nof the United Nations in the international community \r\nis unquestionable, and the purposes and principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are valid \r\nand indispensable. The equality of States, refraining \r\nfrom the use of force, non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of other States, respect for sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity, the peaceful solution of disputes \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 53/86\r\nand respect for diversity continue to be vital principles. \r\nMy country supports the equitable participation of \r\nStates in the system of global management, and we \r\nfirmly believe that with political will and a genuine \r\nreadiness to work together, along with a strengthened \r\nrole for the United Nations tailored to addressing \r\nmodern needs, we can reach higher in our efforts to \r\nbuild a better world for all.\r\nThe prevention and solution of disputes and \r\ncrises by peaceful means are indispensable tools for \r\nbuilding and maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. Strengthening a culture of peace and dialogue \r\nand pursuing policies of compromise and peaceful \r\ncoexistence are therefore key factors in that regard. \r\nIn the face of ever more frequent threats and new \r\nchallenges, we must work together constructively to \r\ncreate the conditions for sustainable peace, strengthen \r\ninstitutions and democracy and promote respect for \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a \r\nhistoric document and a vision of world development that \r\ncan empower us to build a better future for humankind \r\nby eradicating poverty and hunger, ensuring inclusive \r\neducation and health and reducing the increasing \r\ninequalities within and among nations.\r\nSerbia strongly condemns terrorism and all forms \r\nof extremism and radicalism that pose a threat to peace. \r\nTogether with the United Nations, in its leading role, \r\nand with our partners all over the world, we stand ready \r\nto make our own contribution to the suppression of \r\nthose threats. As a leader in its region through the scope \r\nof its participation in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations, Serbia believes that peacekeeping is the \r\nresponsibility of all, as are the continued commitment, \r\nengagement and strengthening of the relevant capacities \r\nof the United Nations. The activities of the United \r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo \r\nare particularly important to us, and the undiminished \r\nscope of its neutral status is essential to stability and the \r\ncreation of conditions conducive to achieving a lasting \r\nand sustainable solution to the question of Kosovo \r\nand Metohija. Reaching a political settlement of the \r\nKosovo issue is one of Serbia’s national priorities. In \r\ndefending its sovereignty and territorial integrity, \r\nSerbia is defending international law, the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and international peace and security \r\nas well as its own national and historical identity. My \r\ncountry is firmly committed to peace, the European \r\nUnion-facilitated dialogue between Belgrade and \r\nPristina and to implementing the agreements reached. \r\nIn our conduct of a responsible policy in that regard, we \r\nwill do our best to protect the interests of our people as \r\nwell as regional peace and stability.\r\nIn concluding my statement and once again paying \r\nmy respects to the great man in whose honour we are \r\ngathered here today, I want to assure the Assembly that \r\nSerbia will gladly partner with every country willing \r\nand ready to share the responsibility for building a \r\nstable, just and prosperous world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Wang Yi, State Counsellor and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China.\r\nMr. Wang Yi (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nMr. Nelson Mandela was a prominent South African \r\nleader in the fight against apartheid and the founding \r\nfather of the new South Africa. Throughout his life, \r\nMr. Mandela pursued national liberation in Africa, \r\ndefended the dignity of African people and promoted \r\nthe unity of African countries. He devoted his entire \r\nlife to Africa’s development and progress. We should \r\nforever cherish the part that he played in promoting \r\nthe peace and reconciliation of humankind. His great \r\nspirit will surely encourage future generations to work \r\nunremittingly for peace. It is regrettable, however, that \r\npeace remains elusive in so many places throughout \r\nthe world. As we gather here to commemorate the \r\ncentenary of Mr. Mandela’s birth, we should work to \r\npromote the spirit of peace, reconciliation, equality \r\nand inclusiveness that he advocated, values that will \r\nalso enable the United Nations to better fulfil its noble \r\nmission of maintaining peace.\r\nThe United Nations is the symbol of multilateralism \r\nand an important guardian of world peace. In \r\nMr. Mandela’s time it was the strong moral pressure \r\nof the United Nations and the international community \r\nthat helped to accelerate the disintegration of apartheid. \r\nAs we meet today, unilateralism and protectionism are \r\non the rise, posing severe challenges to the United \r\nNations-centred contemporary international system. \r\nThe international community must stand united under \r\nthe umbrella of multilateralism, uphold the central \r\nrole of the United Nations in international affairs \r\nand provide more predictability and stability in this \r\nturbulent world.\r\nThe path of dialogue and reconciliation is the sure \r\nway towards peace. Mr. Mandela was committed to \r\npolitical negotiation as a means of advancing peace \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n54/86 18-29599\r\nand reconciliation in South Africa. He set an example \r\nfor countries and regions in conflict on how to achieve \r\nnational reconciliation and reconstruction. In the face of \r\ncomplex hotspot issues and rising regional conflicts, the \r\nparties concerned should use dialogue and consultation \r\nto resolve disputes and disagreements, pursuing \r\ninclusive dialogue that accommodates the interests and \r\nlegitimate concerns of all parties. Development is the \r\nfoundation for the consolidation of peace.\r\nMr. Mandela once said that overcoming poverty is \r\nnot a gesture of charity but an act of justice. Indeed, \r\nthe elimination of poverty constitutes the protection of \r\nbasic human rights, because while poverty exists there \r\ncan be no genuine liberty. His words are still highly \r\nrelevant today. Many of the world’s problems have their \r\nroot causes in poverty and can be truly resolved only \r\nthrough development. The world must address both the \r\nsymptoms and the root causes of conflict, implement \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and help \r\ndeveloping countries improve their people’s livelihoods \r\nand enhance development capacity so as to provide the \r\nbasic foundations for sustainable peace.\r\nMr. Mandela was a pioneer in the relationship \r\nbetween China and South Africa and made important \r\ncontributions to China’s relations with South Africa \r\nand with Africa as a whole. Together, China and Africa \r\nare now a community with a shared future working \r\nto realize win-win cooperation. Ensuring unity and \r\ncooperation with African countries is not only a major \r\ncornerstone of China’s foreign policy but also its \r\nfirm and long-term strategic position. The Forum on \r\nChina-Africa Cooperation recently held a successful \r\nsummit in Beijing, the best way for us to commemorate \r\nNelson Mandela. The summit brought together \r\nChinese and African leaders to discuss future plans for \r\nChinese-African relations and to draw up a blueprint \r\nfor China-Africa cooperation. President Xi Jinping \r\nproposed that China and Africa work together to build \r\nan even closer community with a shared future and a \r\nfocus on eight major initiatives. The summit ushered \r\nin a new era for China-Africa cooperation and opened \r\nup broader prospects for South-South cooperation, \r\nproviding strong momentum for world stability, peace \r\nand development.\r\nWe call on all countries to view the centenary of \r\nNelson Mandela’s birth as a new starting point and \r\ntoday’s Peace Summit as a new opportunity to jointly \r\nbuild a community with a shared future for humankind \r\nand a world of lasting peace and universal security.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Denis Moses, Minister for Foreign and \r\nCARICOM Affairs of the Republic of Trinidad and \r\nTobago.\r\nMr. Moses (Trinidad and Tobago): Trinidad and \r\nTobago welcomes the opportunity to speak at this \r\nhistoric Peace Summit by which the international \r\ncommunity commemorates the centenary of the birth of \r\nthe activist, leader, nobel laureate and former President \r\nof South Africa, Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela \r\nwas one of the most eminent leaders of our generation. \r\nWe salute him as a freedom fighter and an icon of \r\nreconciliation. His life and legacy are testament to the \r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, that is, to maintain international peace \r\nand security and promote and protect human rights.\r\nWe cannot but be reminded of his powerful \r\nstatement that:\r\n“The world remains beset by so much human \r\nsuffering, poverty and deprivation. It is in your hands \r\nto make of our world a better one for all”. \r\nThat is the very reason we are gathered at the \r\nUnited Nations and the very reason that States \r\nsubscribe to multilateral diplomacy. Mr. Mandela \r\nencouraged nations to resolve conflicts through \r\ndiplomacy and reconciliation. As President of South \r\nAfrica, he advocated that his country’s foreign policy \r\nbe based on human rights. He believed in non-violence \r\nand negotiation as means for solving disputes. That \r\nculture of peace is important for small States such as \r\nTrinidad and Tobago that must rely on the international \r\nrule of law, under strict observance by all States, and \r\nthe purposes and principles laid down in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, in order to guarantee their right to \r\na secure, sovereign and peaceful existence.\r\nIn 2004, Trinidad and Tobago had the distinct \r\nhonour of welcoming Nelson Mandela to its shores. \r\nAmong the many issues that we discussed, the role of \r\nsport in creating a culture of peace, as well as gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women, featured \r\nprominently on the agenda. In 2014, a park in our \r\ncapital city of Port of Spain was renamed in his honour. \r\nMr. Mandela’s memory therefore lives on in Trinidad \r\nand Tobago. We pay tribute to Mr. Mandela’s foresight, \r\nas evidenced in the words “peace is the greatest \r\nweapon for development that anyone can have”. In that \r\nconnection, Trinidad and Tobago would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to renew its commitment to the full \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 55/86\r\nand effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and to reaffirm our pledge \r\nto leave no one behind. We also look forward to the \r\nactivities to be convened within the framework of \r\nthe 2019-2028 Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace and \r\ncommit to actively participating in those initiatives.\r\nFinally, Trinidad and Tobago reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to honouring Nelson Mandela’s legacy \r\nand continuing to abide by his values and self less \r\ndedication to the service of humankind. We call on \r\nthe international community to renew its commitment \r\nto global peace, conflict prevention and resolution, \r\npeacebuilding, the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights, and development. Like Madiba, as Mr. Mandela \r\nwas fondly known, may we also commit to doing our \r\npart by leaving this world a better place before we \r\ndepart it.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Everly Paul Chet Greene, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, International Trade and Immigration \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda.\r\nMr. Greene (Antigua and Barbuda): Antigua and \r\nBarbuda joins the rest of the world at this prestigious \r\nPeace Summit and, in particular, pays homage to \r\nNelson Mandela, known as Madiba. Let us find within \r\nourselves the resolve to confront the threats to peace \r\nfor humankind in all their dimensions, a lesson that \r\nMandela taught us by example and to which we are all \r\ngreat heirs.\r\nConfronting the root causes that threaten peace \r\nis by no means an easy task. However, the increased \r\nattention we are seeing to some of the most deep-\r\nrooted problems facing the international community \r\ntoday gives us hope. Unfortunately, the consideration \r\nof peace only comes in the wake of the indescribable \r\nhorrors that are caused by humankind’s stubborn \r\nclinging to old patterns of behaviour. But as we look \r\naround our global community, we ask ourselves \r\nwhat we can do to solve the many problems we face. \r\nHow can we find and maintain the peace that we so \r\ngenuinely and passionately desire? Today I implore us \r\nto ask ourselves, not as individuals, but as members of \r\nthe General Assembly: what is peace? Our objective \r\nbrainstorming should leave us positively resolved to \r\nfind the answer to that all-important question.\r\nAllow me to share with the Assembly some elements \r\nof what peace entails for the small micro-island State of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda. Peace means respect for human \r\nrights and the differences of others. It means ensuring \r\nthe protection of women, children, the elderly and \r\nthe disabled. Peace is devoid of the greed that ends in \r\nunparalleled wealth for a few and nauseating poverty \r\nfor the many. Peace means global health awareness, \r\nprotection and accessibility for all. Peace encourages \r\ndemocracy for global citizens through non-violent \r\nchange and non-interference in the application of \r\ndemocracy by sovereign States. Peace is the elimination \r\nof nuclear weapons and the control of small arms. \r\nPeace is the absence of violence and the acceptance \r\nof differences in race, gender and religion. Peace is \r\na position from which to value the limits of nature’s \r\nresources. It is the absence of the ignorance and short-\r\nsightedness that selfishly plunder Earth’s plenty. Peace \r\nis the understanding that climate change is real and that \r\nsustainability should be our top priority. Peace means \r\nfair trade, equality, equity in globalization and the right \r\nto development.\r\nThe time has come for us to act decisively, \r\nnotwithstanding the limitations of the Assembly. When \r\nwe have been called on in the past to act as a community \r\nof nations, we have risen to the occasion. We have given \r\nhope and protection to millions the world over through \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide, and by challenging all forms of \r\ndiscrimination based on race, sex or religious belief and \r\nupholding the rights of the child and the empowerment \r\nof women, to name but a few examples.\r\nAs we focus on peace and its contributing factors, it \r\nwould be remiss of me if I did not recall the International \r\nDecade for People of African Descent and the ongoing \r\nefforts with respect to reparatory justice. We can do so \r\nmuch more if we take a stand. As the indomitable Nelson \r\nMandela remarked, “Do not look the other way; do not \r\nhesitate. Recognize that the world is hungry for action, \r\nnot words. Act with courage and vision.” As Mandela \r\nwent on to note, “sometimes it falls upon a generation \r\nto be great. You can be that great generation.”\r\nI am heartened by the adoption of the political \r\ndeclaration (resolution 73/1) of the Peace Summit and \r\nthe General Assembly’s recognition that peace can be \r\nachieved universally. We can be that great generation.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Gilles Tonelli, Government Adviser \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the \r\nPrincipality of Monaco.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n56/86 18-29599\r\nMr. Tonelli (Monaco) (spoke in French): The \r\nNelson Mandela Peace Summit brings us together to \r\ncelebrate the legacy of an extraordinary man who has \r\nbecome a symbol of the struggle against oppression \r\nand injustice around the world. It is particularly \r\nsymbolic that the centenary of the birth of Nelson \r\nMandela coincides with the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption by the General Assembly of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\r\nThroughout his life, Nelson Mandela worked \r\ntirelessly, risking his own life, for tolerance, dialogue, \r\npeace and justice. After 27 years on Robben Island, his \r\ncourage enabled him to reject revenge and instead seek \r\ndialogue and reconciliation. Not only was apartheid \r\nended, but Nelson Mandela became a statesman and a \r\nlegend in his lifetime.\r\nThe troublemaker who won the 1993 Nobel Peace \r\nPrize for his moral and political struggle said that “a \r\nman does not become a freedom fighter in the hope of \r\nwinning awards”. Whether through the establishment \r\nof his foundation in 1999 or the creation of The Elders \r\nin 2007, Nelson Mandela never stopped working to \r\nresolve the crises that destabilize our societies and \r\nendanger humankind. I would like to conclude with a \r\nquote from Nelson Mandela that he made during a visit \r\nto Monaco:\r\n“Sport has the power to change the world. It \r\nhas the power to inspire. It has the power to unite \r\npeople in a way that little else does. It speaks to \r\nyoung people in a language they understand.”\r\nTheir Serene Highnesses Prince Albert II and his \r\nwife Princess Charlene, both Olympians, continue \r\nto maintain that message of hope through their \r\ncharitable actions.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mamadi Touré, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and for Guineans Abroad of the Republic of \r\nGuinea.\r\nMr. Touré (Guinea) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I would like to convey to the General Assembly \r\nthe sincere regrets of President Mr. Alpha Condé of \r\nGuinea, who wanted to participate in this important \r\nhigh-level meeting but was unable to do so owing to \r\nprior engagements.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea is delighted to be able \r\nto participate in this meeting on peace, to which that \r\ngreat son of Africa Nelson Mandela dedicated his life. \r\nHis long struggle against every form of oppression, \r\ninjustice, racism and discrimination represents a \r\nshining light for the whole of humankind in its quest for \r\na world of fairness and shared prosperity. Thanks to his \r\nresilience and his keen sense of forgiveness and human \r\ndignity, he was able to build a pluralistic society in \r\nwhich every sector of his nation could live in harmony. \r\nThat humanist vision, which guided him throughout \r\nhis journey, enabled him to transcend the stigma of \r\napartheid and to achieve the national reconciliation and \r\nstability that characterize South Africa today.\r\nThis Peace Summit is being held against an \r\ninternational backdrop of routine violations of the \r\nfoundations of peace. We are witnessing an increase in \r\nterrorism, violent extremism and intolerance. The life \r\nof Madiba is a lesson for our current generations and \r\nthose of the future, and from now on it is up to us take \r\nownership of his virtues in pursuit of a better world, \r\nin which dialogue, agreement and the acceptance of \r\nothers are the watchwords for our collective action. \r\nIn the struggle to promote the peace we need for \r\ndevelopment and the benefit of our peoples, we have \r\nthe responsibility to promote and strengthen the role of \r\nthe United Nations as represented by its purposes and \r\nprinciples. The meeting that brings us together today \r\nis all the more symbolic because it coincides with the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights.\r\nI would like to conclude by warmly welcoming \r\nthe political declaration that we have adopted today \r\n(resolution 73/1).\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Muhammadu \r\nBuhari, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\r\nPresident Buhari: It is indeed a great honour to \r\nparticipate in this historic event reflecting on global \r\npeace and commemorating the centenary of the birth \r\nof Nelson Mandela, a man whose life symbolized \r\nuncommon humility, compassion, courage and \r\nforgiveness. Our sincere appreciation goes to President \r\nCyril Ramaphosa, of South Africa, and Prime \r\nMinister Leo Varadkar, of Ireland, and their teams for \r\nnurturing and finalizing the political declaration that \r\nwe have adopted today (resolution 73/1) and that will \r\nundoubtedly set forth commitments that will honour \r\nthe legacy of Nelson Mandela.\r\nWe are witnessing a time in which the world is \r\nfacing diverse challenges that range from conflicts to \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 57/86\r\nclimate change, terrorism, desertification, poverty, \r\narms trafficking and violent extremism. Yet it is also a \r\ntime of great hope and renaissance. When he was facing \r\nthe death penalty in April 1964, Nelson Mandela spoke \r\nfrom the dock at the end of his Rivonia trial and said:\r\n“During my lifetime, I have dedicated myself \r\nto this struggle of the African people. I have \r\nfought against white domination and I have fought \r\nagainst black domination. I have cherished the \r\nideal of a democratic and free society in which all \r\npersons live together in harmony and with equal \r\nopportunities. It is an ideal that I hope to live for \r\nand to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for \r\nwhich I am prepared to die.”\r\nIt is in the context of that ethos of the great Mandela \r\nthat we are adopting today’s declaration. We must \r\ntherefore make concerted efforts to foster a just, \r\npeaceful, prosperous, inclusive and fair world and \r\nrevive the values for which Nelson Mandela stood by \r\nplacing human dignity at the centre of our actions. \r\nThis centenary celebration is a way for us to reflect \r\non the legacy of Nelson Mandela and his unwavering \r\nadvocacy for human rights, social justice and peace. \r\nIt also affords us the rare privilege of rededicating \r\nourselves to the service of humankind by championing \r\ndemocracy, conflict resolution, disarmament, mutual \r\nrespect, reconciliation, gender equality and the fight \r\nagainst poverty. There can be no doubt that in the quest \r\nto attain peace and development, the world will draw \r\ninspiration from the life of Nelson Mandela.\r\nAs we herald the Nelson Mandela Decade of \r\nPeace, Nigeria calls on all States to recognize that \r\nthe United Nations is built on the pillars of peace and \r\nsecurity, development and human rights, which are the \r\nfoundations of our collective well-being. We emphasize \r\nthat there can be no peace without sustainable \r\ndevelopment and no sustainable development without \r\npeace and full respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms for all.\r\nThrough this declaration, we recognize the \r\ncontribution of women to the advancement of societies \r\nand to the prevention and resolution of conflict. We are \r\ncommitted to promoting and protecting the rights of \r\nall women and to providing them with an environment \r\nthat can enable them to realize their full potential. We \r\nalso recognize that the inherent dignity and equal and \r\ninalienable rights of all peoples of the world are the \r\nfoundation of freedom, justice and world peace. We \r\ndeclare that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand related intolerance present the very opposite of the \r\nnoble purposes of the United Nations. We recognize \r\nthat tolerance of cultural, ethnic, racial and religious \r\ndiversity is essential to lasting peace, understanding \r\nand friendship among peoples, nations, cultures \r\nand individuals.\r\nAs Mandela passes into history, we stand with him \r\nin his aspirations for a better world. It is our duty to \r\nlive up to his indelible legacy by collectively holding \r\nourselves accountable to the values, principles and \r\nhopes of the Declaration and striving for a just, peaceful, \r\nprosperous, democratic, fair and inclusive world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ahmed Awad Isse, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Federal Republic of Somalia.\r\nMr. Isse (Somalia): It is a great honour for me to \r\naddress the General Assembly at this Nelson Mandela \r\nPeace Summit. The great Mandela embodied the \r\nqualities of a transformative leader, who steered his \r\npeople with devotion and principled ideals and wielded \r\nthe strong leadership of a man who truly understood \r\nthe importance of healing a divided nation. He will be \r\nremembered as a magnanimous leader who symbolized \r\nhumility, compassion and courage, and as an icon \r\nof democracy.\r\nMandela’s persistence and determination to embark \r\non his long walk to freedom, even when facing brutal \r\nsituations, made it possible for the likes of Abdulrahim \r\nAbby Farah, the former Permanent Representative of \r\nSomalia to the United Nations, who headed the United \r\nNations Special Committee against Apartheid, to spring \r\ninto action to end the indignity of apartheid.\r\nMandela left us many legacies. The memorable \r\nevent of the final game of the Rugby World Cup hosted \r\nby South Africa in 1995 served as a pivotal moment, \r\nnot only for the people of South Africa but for the whole \r\nworld. Nelson Mandela rallied national support for the \r\ngame by emphasizing the importance of supporting \r\nthe national team as an act of unity. For six weeks he \r\nworked tirelessly to present his case to the people of \r\nSouth Africa by stressing the importance of oneness, \r\nharmony and peace. On that day in 1994, the spectators \r\nall stood together chanting the name of a revered \r\nleader — Mandela, Mandela, Mandela. All it took was \r\none gesture by a great man to change the course of a \r\nnation’s history forever and usher in a sense of equality, \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n58/86 18-29599\r\nharmony and peace. Here I too would like to recall one \r\nof my favourite lines of Mandela,\r\n“I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and \r\nfree society in which all persons live together in \r\nharmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal \r\nthat I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs \r\nbe, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die”.\r\nMandela’s unwavering commitment and his transformative \r\nleadership should inspire us all as world leaders.\r\nIt is gratifying to be able to recognize Abdulrahim \r\nAbby Farah, our former Permanent Representative \r\nto the United Nations, who passed away recently, \r\nfor his contribution in presiding over the release of \r\nMandela. I want to highlight that to illustrate the \r\ninterconnectedness that exists between African nations \r\nand indeed humankind, as well as what the power of \r\nunity and integration can accomplish. Mandela utilized \r\nthose very ideals to develop a road map that laid the \r\nfoundation for a resilient and democratic post-apartheid \r\nSouth Africa. Those same principles and values of \r\nforgiveness, social integration and national healing \r\nare models that Somalia is embarking on as we work \r\ntowards advancing peace, security, good governance \r\nand building responsive and effective State institutions.\r\nIn conclusion, and as we celebrate the legacy of \r\nMadiba, Somalia supports the political declaration \r\n(resolution 73/1) of this important Nelson Mandela \r\nPeace Summit.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Dionísio Da Costa Babo Soares, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste.\r\nMr. Babo Soares (Timor-Leste): Timor-Leste \r\nis proud to join the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit \r\nin commemoration of the magnificent legacy of \r\nNelson Mandela and the centenary of his birth. We \r\nhonour Nelson Mandela as a great humanitarian and \r\nfor his dedication and contribution to world peace, \r\nreconciliation and human rights.\r\nFor us, Nelson Mandela’s bequest as a great mentor \r\nof peace and reconciliation inspired Timor-Leste in our \r\nstruggle for independence and in what we are today as \r\na nation. His thoughts and principles encouraged us and \r\ngave us hope and confidence during our bleakest times, \r\nas we struggled against oppression and colonization on \r\nour journey to independence. We are deeply grateful to \r\nhim and all his efforts to help us with our long-standing \r\nstruggle to achieve independence. I remember very \r\nclearly the time he visited our resistance leader Xanana \r\nGusmão in prison in 1995. That simple gesture was to \r\nprove an important turning point in our history. Nelson \r\nMandela impressed on us the importance of dialogue, \r\nand the need to understand other political and cultural \r\nviews in order to settle our differences.\r\nWe realized that dialogue was an extremely \r\neffective way to reduce tensions between us and our \r\nopponents. That resulted in the understanding that \r\nwe needed to end the fighting in order to find peace \r\namong ourselves. Madiba’s vision of reconciliation \r\ntruly inspired us and provided a stepping stone for the \r\ncreation of our own Commission for Reception, Truth \r\nand Reconciliation, which listened to and registered \r\nthousands of testimonies of suffering and loss, and \r\nfacilitated traditional community-based reconciliation \r\nprocesses. That helped us to heal as a nation, so that \r\nwe could move forward towards our future without the \r\nburden of the past. The Commission produced a report, \r\nChega, which means “enough”.\r\nOur founding fathers also wisely chose to extend \r\nreconciliation beyond our national borders, and we \r\nwere also inspired to establish a Commission on Truth \r\nand Friendship with our nearest neighbour, Indonesia, \r\nin order to forge strong relations and long-lasting \r\ndiplomatic ties between us. Madiba’s legacy also \r\ninspired us to come together and establish the Group \r\nof 7 Plus platform in 2010, together with 19 other \r\ncountries across five continents, to pursue dialogue \r\nand reconciliation based on a spirit of voluntarism, \r\nsolidarity and cooperation.\r\nIn today’s world, where we see protracted \r\nconflicts and great human suffering, Nelson Mandela’s \r\ndedication, efforts and struggle for a fairer, more \r\ninclusive and peaceful world are an important reminder \r\nof our collective responsibility to achieve that. We \r\nare urged to action by his commitment to women’s \r\nempowerment and his emphasis on their crucial \r\nrole at the peace table, as well as the importance of \r\nlistening to and involving our young people in all our \r\nnational processes. The political declaration that we \r\nhave adopted at this summit (resolution 73/1) should \r\nseal the responsibility of each one of us today to take \r\nall actions within our reach for peace.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Milner Tozaka, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and External Trade of Solomon Islands.\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 59/86\r\nMr. Tozaka (Solomon Islands): Amid all the \r\nchallenges and calamities that have gripped our world, \r\nthe hosting of a peace summit is fitting and timely and \r\nrightly marks the centenary of the birth of a beacon of \r\nhumanity, Nelson Mandela.\r\nAs global leaders, we have the ultimate responsibility \r\nto ensure that the generations that succeed us do not \r\ninherit a world of full of fear and depredation. We must \r\nrather use every possible means to enable peace to \r\nprevail in all that we do. We must strive to eliminate \r\nconflict by building bridges and forging partnerships \r\nand relationships despite our differences. Since its \r\ninception, the United Nations has continued to actively \r\nadvocate from a platform of peace. The Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations remains the firm compass by which we \r\nset our course of action. It compels each us to fulfil \r\nthe shared duty to uphold peaceful coexistence within \r\nand among our countries, seek to settle disputes and \r\nuse intensive, sustained and inclusive dialogue as a \r\nfirst resort in resolving differences and conflicts. If \r\nwe dedicate our attention to promoting reconciliation \r\namong our peoples and between our nations, bitter \r\nrivalries and warfare will serve no purpose.\r\nNelson Mandela epitomized the values and \r\nprinciples of humanity and global citizenship. He \r\nshowed that genuine reconciliation can rid the world of \r\ndiscrimination and achieve peace. These are examples \r\nand values that we must encourage and follow through \r\nupon with firm action if we are to truly honour \r\nhis legacy.\r\nSolomon Islands also subscribes to the notion that \r\nthere is no single template for peace and that the United \r\nNations must be responsive to individual situations on \r\nthe ground. The seeds of peace germinate development, \r\neconomic prosperity and sustained growth. We also \r\nrecognize that the prevailing circumstances in our \r\nindividual countries may undermine the foundations \r\non which sustained peace can thrive. Peacebuilding and \r\nnation-building are ideals that foster unity, particularly \r\nin post-conflict States. I speak to the experience of \r\nSolomon Islands as a post-conflict State, aspiring to \r\nmaintain sustainable peace. The peaceful coexistence \r\nof communities and peoples must not elude us or be \r\ntaken for granted.\r\nThe values of peace and humanity are priceless. \r\nNelson Mandela’s life and ability to overcome adversity \r\nand ultimately triumph set a benchmark for leadership \r\nto which we all aspire. In pledging my Government’s \r\nsupport for today’s political declaration (resolution \r\n73/1), I would like to cite the words of the man who \r\nstands as a beacon of peace and humanity today: “We \r\ncommit ourselves to the construction of a complete, just \r\nand lasting peace.”\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Augustine Phillip Mahiga, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, East Africa, Regional and International \r\nCooperation of the United Republic of Tanzania.\r\nMr. Mahiga (Tanzania): I would like to express \r\nour sincere gratitude to South Africa and Ireland for \r\ntheir excellent organization of today’s important high-\r\nlevel event. On behalf of my country, and on my own \r\nbehalf, we thank the organizers and the United Nations \r\nfor designating today as a day of commemoration.\r\nWe are here to recognize, commemorate and \r\ncelebrate the lifetime contributions and ideals of Nelson \r\nMandela as well as his practical involvement in realizing \r\nfreedom, justice and peace in the world in general, and \r\nin Africa in particular. As we celebrate the centenary \r\nof his birth, we remind ourselves of his unique legacy \r\nof a spirit of patriotism and endurance in the work \r\nthat he accomplished during his lifetime. He did it in \r\na spirit of reconciliation and of future participation in \r\nworld affairs. We look to this day as a day of peace \r\nand reconciliation, a day when human rights received \r\na champion by the name of Nelson Mandela, and a day \r\nfor the future prosperity of Africa and the world.\r\nThe liberation of Africa ushered in peace and \r\ndemocracy. Tanzania is proud to have hosted the \r\nheadquarters of the African Liberation Committee of \r\nthe Organization of African Unity and took an active \r\npart in the liberation struggle to emancipate our fellow \r\nAfrican brothers and sisters. We shall not forget that \r\nAfrica’s struggle for independence was very much \r\ninspired by the late Julius Mwalimu Nyerere who, in \r\nhis last days, worked together with the late Nelson \r\nMandela to lay the foundations of peace, reconciliation \r\nand stability in Burundi. To live up to the commitment \r\nof helping the liberation struggle, Tanzania not only \r\nbecame the seat of the African National Congress and \r\nother liberation movements in Southern Africa, it has \r\nalso remained committed to the cause of freedom, \r\npeace and justice throughout the world, particularly \r\nunder the banner of the United Nations.\r\nMandela was not only a committed leader; he will \r\nalso remain an icon of peace for the world and for \r\nAfrica, showing the way to a path of reconciliation \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n60/86 18-29599\r\nand an option for peace rather than conflict in finding \r\nsolutions to difficult issues related to conflicts. \r\nFurthermore, as we bring forth the political declaration \r\nwe have adopted today (resolution 73/1), let us all \r\nbe reminded of Mandela’s long-standing values and \r\nhumanitarian service in conflict resolution and the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. I stand here \r\nto reiterate that Tanzania will always be a champion \r\nand active advocate for preserving his legacy and the \r\nmaintenance of peace in the spirit of Madiba that we \r\nare celebrating today.\r\nI would like to conclude by encouraging current and \r\nfuture leaders to make use of the exemplary leadership \r\nof Nelson Mandela to encourage tolerant, harmonious \r\nsocieties and peaceful coexistence. His last words to \r\nthe General Assembly and to the United Nations should \r\nalways serve as a lasting reminder of the important role \r\nof the Organization in the liberation of South Africa \r\nand other African countries, and we should hold him \r\nin high esteem as one of the pillars that will always \r\nunderscore the significance of the United Nations as a \r\ncitadel of peace for us today and for future generations.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker for this afternoon. In view of the late hour, we \r\nwill now suspend this plenary meeting. We will hear the \r\nremaining speakers on Tuesday, 2 October, at 10 a.m.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 6.15 p.m. on \r\nMonday, 24 September, and resumed at 10.10 a.m. \r\non Tuesday, 2 October.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Before proceeding \r\nto the item on our agenda, in keeping with established \r\npractice, I would like to draw the attention of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to document A/73/367/Add.1, in \r\nwhich the Secretary-General informs the President of \r\nthe General Assembly that, since the issuance of his \r\ncommunication contained in document A/73/367/Rev.1, \r\nGuinea-Bissau has made the payment necessary to \r\nreduce its arrears specified in Article 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes \r\ndue note of the information contained in document \r\nA/73/367/Add.1?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The General \r\nAssembly will now resume the Nelson Mandela Peace \r\nSummit in order to get to the end of the list of speakers \r\nfrom Monday, 24 September.\r\nBefore we begin with the list of speakers, I \r\nwould like to remind members of some important \r\norganizational matters pertaining to the conduct of \r\nplenary meetings. I would like to appeal to all speakers \r\nto keep their statements brief and concise in order to \r\nmake maximum use of the limited time we have for this \r\nhigh-level meeting. In order to enable all on the list of \r\nspeakers to be heard, statements should be limited to \r\nthree minutes when speaking in a national capacity and \r\nfive minutes when speaking on behalf of a group, as \r\nstipulated in resolution 72/243.\r\nAs members will recall, in its resolution 72/313, \r\nof 17 September, the General Assembly called for \r\nspeakers to adhere strictly to the time limits in the \r\nAssembly, particularly during high-level meetings. To \r\nassist speakers in managing their time, a light system \r\nhas been installed at the speaker’s rostrum. Participants \r\nwith longer statements are encouraged to read a shorter \r\nversion of their text and to submit their full statements \r\nto the Secretariat for posting on the PaperSmart portal.\r\nAlso in accordance with resolution 72/313, the “all \r\nprotocol observed” principle is recommended, whereby \r\nparticipants are encouraged to refrain from the listing of \r\nstandard protocol expressions during their statements. \r\nBearing in mind the time limit, I would like to appeal \r\nto speakers to deliver their statements at a reasonable \r\npace so that interpretation into the six official United \r\nNations languages may be properly provided.\r\nI appeal for speakers’ cooperation in observing the \r\ntime limits for statements so that all those inscribed on \r\nthe list can be heard in a timely manner.\r\nI now give the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Vladimir \r\nMakei, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic \r\nof Belarus.\r\nMr. Makei (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): I would \r\nlike to begin my statement at this event dedicated to \r\nNelson Mandela, one of the most famous people ever \r\nto fight for Africa’s independence, with some of his \r\nown words: “It is so easy to break down and destroy. \r\nThe heroes are those who make peace and build.” It is \r\nno coincidence that our Peace Summit is named for a \r\nstatesman and a great political leader, a Nobel Peace \r\nPrize laureate who is inextricably linked to an entire \r\nera of modern history. The ideals preached by Mandela \r\nmade the international community believe that world \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 61/86\r\npeace might not be an illusion. Rather, it is a reality that \r\nwe States Members of the United Nations can and must \r\nachieve together.\r\nUnfortunately, not everybody heeds Mandela’s \r\npreaching. Today there are still wars and geopolitical \r\nclashes and conflicts. Decade after decade, we \r\ncontinue to see few practical, viable results from the \r\ninternational efforts to prevent armed conflicts and free \r\nthe world of weapons of mass destruction. Nor have we \r\nseen significant progress in the bilateral forums for \r\ndisarmament negotiations. In fact, the threats posed by \r\nnuclear weapons are becoming more tangible and are \r\nhaving a direct impact on global and regional security. \r\nTo take just one example, a mechanism as effective as \r\nthat of nuclear-weapon-free zones is still a long way \r\nfrom covering every region of the world. In the mid-\r\n1990s Belarus proposed setting up nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzones in Central and Eastern Europe. At the time, \r\nunfortunately, our well-intentioned impulse and call \r\nwent unheeded. Perhaps today, with the world closer \r\nthan it has ever been to the threat of a major conflict, \r\nwe should look at that initiative in a new light.\r\nThe main reason for the growing confrontations, \r\nwhich represent a serious obstacle on the path to \r\nuniversal peace and harmony, is the lack of trust, unity, \r\nmutual respect and solidarity between countries. If we \r\nare to attain Nelson’s Mandela’s grand ideals in the \r\nservice of the entire international community, we must \r\naim only for those goals and priorities that can engender \r\nunifying, consensus-based ideas and approaches and \r\nenjoy universal support. And we can achieve that only \r\nby strengthening confidence-building measures among \r\nevery participant, without exception, in international \r\nefforts for peace. Today the world needs a new format \r\nfor international relations, based on modern principles \r\ndesigned to ensure peace, security and cooperation. \r\nTo that end, Belarus has proposed conducting a \r\nbroad dialogue aimed at transcending the current \r\ndisagreements between States and developing new \r\nprinciples for collaborative efforts that are acceptable \r\nto all. Belarus is ready to join and participate actively \r\nin that process, and will continue to contribute to \r\nregional security.\r\nIn conclusion, I would again like to cite some words \r\nof Nelson Mandela, which are as relevant today as when \r\nthey were first spoken and which demand an answer.\r\n“All of us should ask ourselves the question: have I \r\ndone everything in my power to bring about lasting \r\npeace and prosperity in my city and my country?”\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Federal Democratic Republic \r\nof Nepal.\r\nMr. Gyawali (Nepal): At the outset, I would like \r\nto commend you, Madam President, for convening this \r\nimportant summit to mark the centenary of the birth of \r\nNelson Mandela.\r\nI feel honoured to be asked to offer a sincere \r\ntribute to an extraordinary statesman of our time. He \r\nwas indeed the epitome of struggle, freedom, human \r\ndignity and democracy. The strength of unity, the \r\npower of discipline, the influence of humility and \r\nthe results of diligence are the lessons that we can \r\nlearn from his life. He taught us the importance of \r\nreconciliation, forgiveness and compassion by forgiving \r\neven those who had taken away everything he had. \r\nTruth eventually emerges triumphant, no matter how \r\nstrong the adversaries are, and a sense of fortitude and \r\nsacrifice defeats even the most invincible. His career, \r\nwhich spanned his years as an anti-apartheid activist to \r\nhis visionary presidency, is a living testimony to that, \r\nand his ideals will continue to inspire humanity. In that \r\nregard, Nepal is proud to recall its service as a member \r\nof the Special Committee against Apartheid since its \r\ninception and as its Vice-Chair for 25 years.\r\nNepal, the birthplace of Buddha, the apostle \r\nof peace, has unwavering faith in peace. The long \r\ncontribution we have made to United Nations peace \r\noperations testifies to that. Nepal shares the vicissitudes \r\nof Africa’s revolutionary past. Our history has been \r\nmarked by long struggles against the aggression of \r\nimperialists; authoritarian regimes and socioeconomic \r\nand political oppression, and by our efforts to cement \r\nour most recent peace process. The Nepali people have \r\nshown exemplary resilience in the pursuit of peace. Our \r\npolitical forces have exhibited wisdom and chosen a \r\npath of peaceful solutions to conflict through dialogue \r\nand accommodation, ideals embraced by the late Nelson \r\nMandela. Our home-grown, nationally owned and led \r\npeace process helped us to make a successful transition \r\nto becoming a stable, peaceful State after the holding \r\nof peaceful democratic elections under the Constitution \r\nadopted by our people’s representatives.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n62/86 18-29599\r\nEvery conflict situation is unique and demands \r\ncontext-specific solutions. Just as there is no universal \r\nmodel for conflict resolution, there is no single model for \r\naddressing issues of peace and justice. The main thrust \r\nof our peace process has been to achieve reconciliation \r\nby healing the wounds left by conflict. We believe that \r\nas long as the parties to a conflict choose to address \r\naccountability issues through a functioning national \r\njustice system and to seek accommodation through \r\nreconciliation, it is unnecessary to have recourse to the \r\ninternational justice system. That is our understanding \r\nof paragraph 19 of the political declaration we have \r\nadopted (resolution 73/1). Nepal has allowed the \r\nindependent transitional justice process to take its \r\ncourse, in accordance with our laws. We are now well \r\non the way to reconciliation by ensuring social justice, \r\nnurturing an inclusive society and delivering good \r\ngovernance. Nepal reaffirms its faith in the values of \r\nworld peace and stands ready to share our experiences \r\nof our successful peace process.\r\nAs I am sharing this success story with the Assembly, \r\nconflicts around the world continue unabated. The \r\naspirations of millions for equality, justice, peace \r\nand development continue to elude us, seven decades \r\nafter of the establishment of the United Nations. Our \r\ncommitment to forgiveness, reconciliation, humanity \r\nand peace, not just in words but in actions, would be a \r\ntrue tribute to Madiba.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Excellency Mr. Paul Oquist Kelley, \r\nMinister and Private Secretary for National Policies of \r\nthe Presidency of the Republic of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Oquist Kelley (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nIt is an honour for Nicaragua to participate in this \r\nhistoric Nelson Mandela Peace Summit in honour of the \r\ncentenary of the birth of that giant of humankind and \r\nlover of inclusion, democracy, tolerance and peace. We \r\nendorse the theme and the political declaration of this \r\nSummit, which reflects the values of Nelson Mandela, \r\nin particular where it says,\r\n“We also reaffirm our commitment to upholding \r\nthe sovereign equality of all States, respect for their \r\nterritorial integrity and political independence \r\nand the duty of Member States to refrain in their \r\ninternational relations from the threat or use of \r\nforce in any manner” and “non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of States.”\r\nThe Sandinista people’s revolution served as a \r\nsource of inspiration to Nelson Mandela, who said \r\nthat the Sandinista revolution gave South Africans \r\nconfidence in their own struggle when they saw the \r\ndifficult circumstances in which the Sandinistas fought \r\nfor change in Nicaragua, and that greatly encouraged \r\nthem. In 1991 there was a historic meeting between \r\nNelson Mandela, President of the African National \r\nCongress; Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, National President \r\nof the Workers’ Party of Brazil; and Commander Daniel \r\nOrtega Saavedra, General Secretary of the Sandinista \r\nNational Liberation Front of Nicaragua, accompanied \r\nby our current Vice President, Ms. Rosario Murillo \r\nZambrana. At that meeting Mandela described \r\nCommander Daniel Ortega as a hero in South Africa \r\nand expressed his certainty that he was a hero for all the \r\ndemocrats and progressives of the world. He assured \r\nthe Commander of his full support for the Sandinistas, \r\nas a progressive force that deserved to be supported \r\nby all.\r\nAt Madiba’s passing, the President Commander \r\nDaniel Ortega Saavedra wrote,\r\n“The world says farewell to a great man, a \r\nmyth, a legend, a part of the heritage of Africa and \r\nof humankind. Nelson Mandela lived every day of \r\nhis life fighting consistently for peace, brotherhood \r\nand human dignity. We feel the enormous loss \r\nthat his death represents for his heroic people \r\nand for African peoples in general. Mandela was \r\ntheir leader in their greatest battles. We know his \r\nlegacy will prevail and that his life will continue to \r\ninspire those of us who believe that a better world \r\nis possible.”\r\nNelson Mandela was a great friend to our Sandinista \r\nrevolution and to the people of Nicaragua. During \r\nthe 95 years of his life he made history, bequeathing \r\nto us principles, values and exemplary practices. \r\nIn these times of struggle against discrimination, \r\nracism, oppression and disrespect for the dignity \r\nand self-determination of peoples, his testimony of \r\ncommitment grows every day, becoming a standard for \r\nall of us who love freedom and recognize the inviolable \r\nhuman condition.\r\nDespite the fact that in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean we have reiterated our will to reaffirm \r\nourselves as a zone of peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, the intentions of certain countries to \r\nimplement their destabilizing plans and coups d’état \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 63/86\r\nagainst our legitimate Governments persist. The \r\nlegitimate Government of Commander Daniel Ortega \r\nhas recently been a victim of destabilizing plans and \r\nan attempted coup d’état. That failed coup attempt has \r\nnow been defused and defeated by the courage and \r\nconviction of the people of Nicaragua themselves. Since \r\nJuly, victorious, they have restored the peace and calm \r\nthat we won with great effort over the past 11 years.\r\nTruth is triumphing over the lies and deception \r\nlevelled at the Government of Nicaragua. Our country \r\nhas resumed its trajectory towards the peace, stability, \r\nsecurity and development that we have been building. \r\nThat means re-establishing the deteriorating mutual \r\nsocial trust and building peace, which we all know \r\nis more than the absence of violence. Moreover, it \r\nalso requires national reconciliation, which President \r\nNelson Mandela achieved in South Africa and President \r\nOrtega accomplished among the national opponents \r\nin the counter-revolutionary war of the 1980s. The \r\nfact that reconciliation was achieved under President \r\nOrtega’s leadership following the 10-year war inspires \r\nconfidence that it will be possible to again bring about \r\na culture of peace and reconciliation, thereby ensuring \r\nNicaragua’s future development and security in a \r\nculture of peace.\r\nIn conclusion, the message that we bring from our \r\nfree Nicaragua, where we continue to fight the shared \r\nbattles for a world of peace, harmony and coexisting \r\ncultures and for human diversity, is this: we pay tribute \r\nto the heroic people of the South Africa Mandela left \r\nus, whose tremendous achievements of reconciliation \r\nand solidarity continue to inspire and encourage us as \r\nwell as the world. Long live Nelson Mandela. Long live \r\nreconciliation and peace.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nf loor to the representative of Burkina Faso.\r\nMr. Tiare (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): \r\nBurkina Faso is delighted to take part in this Summit \r\nconvened in honour of our icon, Nelson Mandela.\r\nFollowing the adoption by the African Union of \r\nthe 2014-2024 Madiba Nelson Mandela Decade of \r\nReconciliation in Africa, today it is the turn of the \r\nUnited Nations, through the General Assembly, to adopt \r\non 24 September the political declaration declaring \r\nthe period 2019-2028 the Nelson Mandela Decade of \r\nPeace (resolution 73/1). The joy with which the political \r\ndeclaration was adopted amply affirms — were there \r\nneed to do so — the great admiration and high regard \r\nof the United Nations for the critical role that President \r\nNelson Mandela played both in his country and beyond.\r\nAt this very moment, as I speak on behalf of my \r\ncountry, Burkina Faso, I am thinking not only of all \r\ncountries that are dealing with hotbeds of conflict \r\nbut also especially of all the people — civilians and \r\nservicemen — who risk their lives daily in theatres \r\nof operations for the cause of peace in the world. I \r\nparticularly spare a sincere thought for the peoples \r\nof the Sahelo-Saharan region, where peace is now \r\ndisturbed by an asymmetrical war, imposed by evil \r\nterrorist forces whose ultimate goal is to destabilize our \r\ncountries and undermine our development efforts.\r\nThe pursuit of peace is ongoing. An analysis of the \r\ncurrent world situation clearly shows us that peace in the \r\ntwenty-first century is inevitably the main quest of our \r\ngeneration. The greatest legacy that we could leave to \r\nfuture generations is to lay the foundations today for its \r\neffectiveness and sustainability. From that standpoint, \r\nNelson Mandela’s life, struggle and sacrifices must be \r\nthe guiding lights for all leaders and at all levels.\r\nOn 24 September, Nelson Mandela inspired more \r\nthan 100 Heads of State and Government, who spoke \r\nfrom this rostrum. Everything, or almost everything, \r\nhas been said about Nelson Mandela, a man of \r\nexceptional qualities and a great leader of our time, \r\nwho taught us that, whatever the situation, it is always \r\npossible to forgive.\r\nMr. Beleffi (San Marino), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nWhat Mandela would ask and expect of us today \r\nis to move from words to deeds through our behaviour \r\nin following in his steps. The political declaration that \r\nwe adopted reminds us all of our role in redoubling \r\nour efforts for international peace and security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights and to build a just. \r\npeaceful, prosperous, fair world that is open to all and \r\nthat revives the values defended by Nelson Mandela. \r\nOur Organization, the United Nations, has a key role to \r\nplay in that regard.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Eswatini.\r\nMr. Kunene (Eswatini): It is an honour for me \r\nto address this high-level plenary meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to commemorate the centenary of an \r\nicon — Nelson Mandela, the first black President of the \r\nRepublic of South Africa, who was born on 18 July.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n64/86 18-29599\r\nAs evidenced by our gathering here today, we \r\nfurther attest to the fact that Nelson Mandela was an \r\ninspirational anti-apartheid revolutionary and a human \r\nrights advocate who was globally renowned. He won the \r\nNobel Prize in 1993 for his advocacy for peace, stability \r\nand coexistence in South Africa. He sacrificed his life \r\nfor 27 years in Robben Island prison in order for the \r\npeople of South Africa to be liberated from apartheid. \r\nHe was a self less leader in our time. He believed in \r\nfreedom for all and equal justice.\r\nThe Kingdom of Eswatini applauds the United \r\nNations leadership for convening this merited gathering \r\nin the name of Mandela. His appeal transcended colour, \r\ncreed, age, gender and race, which was one of his \r\ngreatest lessons to humankind. He accorded respect \r\nto both the young and the elderly. As we celebrate \r\nhis life, we are therefore called upon to live up to his \r\nlegacy, which lives on to this day, and also to champion \r\nhumanity and self lessness.\r\nAs the world finds itself mired in uncertainty, \r\nwe believe that the teachings of Madiba, as he was \r\naffectionately known, would ring true today. To that \r\nend, we note with sadness that one of Madiba’s core \r\nvalues — peace — remains elusive in some parts of \r\nthe globe, including our own beloved continent, Africa. \r\nConflict, racial discrimination, xenophobia, poverty \r\nand inequality continue to haunt us.\r\nIt is instructive how, upon his assumption of the \r\npresidency in 1994, Nelson Mandela sought out a \r\nconciliatory approach to his stewardship. He recognized \r\nthat a divided people are not a desirable circumstance \r\nand did his utmost to heal the rifts that had developed \r\nwith an unexpected and resolute kindness.\r\nThe Kingdom of Eswatini joins the world in \r\nthe spirit of Madiba to reaffirm its commitment to \r\nmeaningful dialogue as an avenue towards preventing \r\nand resolving conflict for the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity in the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Jordan.\r\nMs. Bahous (Jordan): As we gather to honour the \r\nlife and values of Nelson Mandela, I would like to start \r\nby recalling the words spoken by His Majesty King \r\nAbdullah II when the great man of peace passed away. \r\nAt that time, His Majesty said,\r\n“In Jordan, we recall Mandela’s visit to our \r\ncountry and his partnership with us for peace \r\nand development. We share with him a feeling of \r\nresponsibility for a global future where all people \r\nreap the fruits of peace, away from exclusion, \r\npoverty and conflict.”\r\nToday, we salute Nelson Mandela and his \r\noutstanding qualities, his values and his dedication to \r\nthe service of humankind. We salute his unrelenting \r\nefforts to promote peace, justice, equality, democracy \r\nand human rights. We salute him today and every day \r\nas we work towards peace and stability in the Middle \r\nEast and strive to find a solution to the Palestinian-\r\nIsraeli conflict, which remains the crux of the problems \r\nin the region. That brave man, Mandela, described the \r\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict as the greatest moral issue \r\nof our time. Our freedom, he said, is incomplete without \r\nthe freedom of the Palestinians.\r\nThe only path to ending the Palestinian-Israeli \r\nconflict is through a comprehensive settlement based \r\non the two-State solution, which guarantees the \r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State \r\nbased on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital. The road to peace starts in Jerusalem. \r\nThat city of peace, which has suffered for too long from \r\noccupation, will always remain in the hearts of the \r\nbillions of believers around the world. Jordan is very \r\nproud of the historic Hashemite custodianship of the \r\nIslamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem, and we \r\nwill be relentless in countering all attempts aimed at \r\nchanging the historical Arab, Christian and Muslim \r\nidentity of the Holy City.\r\nMandela’s words also ring true when it comes to \r\nmany of the issues facing our region today. He once said,\r\n“As long as poverty, injustice and gross inequality \r\npersist in our world, none of us can truly rest.”\r\nJordan, as the largest refugee-hosting country in \r\nthe world, continues to work with the international \r\ncommunity to mobilize political and financial support \r\nto tackle such systemic injustices. Jordan will continue \r\nresolutely to mobilize the international community \r\nto ensure that the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and \r\nits services continue sustainably and uninterrupted, so \r\nthat 500,000 Palestinian children can continue to go to \r\nschool and thousands of others to receive the necessary \r\nsocial and humanitarian services.\r\nAs the Syrian crisis enters its eighth year, we \r\ncontinue to advocate for a comprehensive political \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 65/86\r\nsolution that is accepted by all components of Syrian \r\nsociety — a solution that guarantees Syria’s unity, \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity and the safety of \r\nall its citizens. The time has come for all parties to lay \r\ndown their weapons and give peace a chance to thrive in \r\na peaceful Syria where refugees can voluntarily return \r\nwithout fear to rebuild their homes, communities and \r\nschools. Jordan is fully committed to peace and will \r\ncontinue to work with the international community to \r\nhelp resolve the many conflicts across our region and \r\nthe world, and to help bring about regional and world \r\npeace and stability.\r\nThe world is facing an unprecedented global terrorist \r\nthreat that seeks to divide us and destroy the common \r\nideals that bind humankind together: tolerance, mercy, \r\ncompassion and mutual respect — the very values \r\nMandela to which dedicated his life. The only way \r\nto defeat that scourge is for all of us to work together \r\nand to win the war of ideas against the ideologies of \r\ndarkness and destruction. Our Summit today is about \r\nthe values that maintain peace, harmony, coexistence \r\nand shared prosperity. Despite our differences, we can \r\ntogether defend and uphold those values. Mandela’s life \r\nis a testament to perseverance and conviction, which \r\ncan create miracles. Together, we must honour his \r\nlegacy and build a peaceful and prosperous future for \r\nall of humankind.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Benin.\r\nMr. Do Rego (Benin) (spoke in French): It is with \r\npride that I take the f loor on behalf of the delegation \r\nof Benin at this high-level plenary meeting dedicated \r\nto the theme of world peace in honour of the centenary \r\nof the birth of Nelson Mandela. I welcome the fact that \r\nthe General Assembly has included in its agenda prior \r\nto the opening of the general debate a commemoration \r\nof this great African icon whose legacy is shared by \r\nall humankind. Who better than Nelson Mandela \r\ncould embody the essential values on which the United \r\nNations is based?\r\nThe fight against all forms of discrimination, \r\nthe defence of everyone’s fundamental rights, the \r\nrecognition of diversity as an asset, as well as tolerance, \r\nforgiveness, reconciliation and the struggle to recognize \r\nthe dignity of all people, all form the cornerstone of \r\nhis commitment to social justice, freedom and peace \r\nin South Africa. Through his struggle, Nelson Mandela \r\nnot only changed the course of history for South \r\nAfrica, but also contributed to changing the world for \r\nthe better. He left us a lesson on the power of peace \r\nand reconciliation, the importance of forgiveness and \r\nrespect for the dignity of each and every human being.\r\nEven as the global level of peace continues to \r\ndeteriorate and inequality widens between countries; as \r\nclimate change, rapid urbanization, food insecurity and \r\nwater shortages aggravate the competition for resources, \r\ndeepening tensions and increasing instability; and as \r\ndespair seems to be on the rise everywhere, the legacy \r\nof Nelson Mandela reminds us that nothing is inevitable \r\nif we act boldly and that as long as we are able to rise \r\nabove our circumstances, we can change the future.\r\nIn an Africa that sometimes doubts its capabilities, \r\nNelson Mandela also teaches us that solutions are found, \r\nfirst and foremost, among the women and men of Africa \r\nwho are resolute in shouldering our responsibilities. He \r\nhas also left us the legacy of a culture of dialogue as \r\nour principal political weapon, rather than violence \r\nand deadly confrontation, as well as that of putting \r\ngeneral interests first rather than those that are racist, \r\nfaction-based, ethnic or partisan. Those are the \r\nassets that allowed my country, Benin, to implement \r\na peaceful regime change in 1990 and introduce an \r\nunprecedented peaceful formula of transition through \r\na coming together of national forces — a formula that \r\nwas also adopted, with varying levels of success, by a \r\ndozen other French-speaking African States.\r\nA long road remains to be travelled in Africa and \r\naround the world in order to achieve greater equality \r\nof opportunities, emancipation and social justice. The \r\nmost beautiful homage we can pay to this illustrious \r\nperson, Nelson Mandela, is to bear his message of hope \r\nand continue to uphold the values for which he struggled \r\nthroughout his entire life. Africa owes  immense \r\ngratitude to a man of such stature, whose name will be \r\nforever etched in the hearts and minds of Africans of \r\nevery generation.\r\nIn these times of inertia, when we sometimes can \r\nbe insufficiently bold, Nelson Mandela remains the \r\npersonification of African dignity because he gave \r\nsubstance to the dream of an Africa standing tall, \r\nfully itself, that brings its voice and experience to \r\nthe development and humanization of our planet. It \r\nis essential that Nelson Mandela’s story be taught to \r\nall children in Africa and around the world and that \r\nyounger generations of Africans use it to nurture their \r\nwillingness to act for the common good.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n66/86 18-29599\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Cambodia.\r\nMr. Ke (Cambodia): I have the honour to address \r\nthis Hall on the occasion of the United Nations Peace \r\nSummit in celebration of the centenary of the birth of \r\nNelson Mandela.\r\nIn his life, Nelson Mandela was a person of \r\nstrength and character who firmly stood in the \r\nface of oppression, ready to challenge it with all his \r\ndetermination and power. Today, he remains a symbol \r\nof peace, justice, reconciliation and compromise. He \r\ndedicated his life to creating a free and peaceful future \r\nfor the people of South Africa, while also creating \r\nan enabling environment for sustainable peace and \r\ndevelopment for all.\r\nMandela’s legacy reminds us of the importance of \r\nworking together. It highlights how cooperation and \r\ncollaboration can lead to the attainment of mutually \r\nbeneficial solutions to some of the most difficult \r\nproblems that the international community faces today. \r\nAs we declare the period 2019 to 2028 the Nelson \r\nMandela Decade of Peace, I would like to urge all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to work together in an \r\never closer manner to achieve our common objective of \r\nsafeguarding a peaceful and prosperous future for all.\r\nIndeed, over the past several years, we have set out \r\nambitious goals for ourselves, aiming to address such \r\npriority issues as global security, hunger, poverty and \r\nclimate change, inter alia. As we implement the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change, we must keep our \r\npeople-centred focus. Cambodia is certain that such \r\nan approach will unite the global community around \r\nour cause, advancing intercultural understanding while \r\nimproving relations among States.\r\nNelson Mandela once said that education is the \r\nmost powerful tool one can use to change the world \r\nfor the better. Cambodia fully agrees with this view. \r\nMy country is committed to lifting people up through \r\neducation. In fact, our national investment in education \r\nprogrammes has brought peace and stability to our \r\ncountry and contributed to a steadily growing economy \r\nthat has averaged 7.7 per cent per annum, while also \r\naiding in the dramatic reduction of poverty rates.\r\nEnsuring access to learning provides young people \r\nwith the knowledge and skills necessary to participate \r\nas full members of global society. It reduces rates of \r\nviolence and extremism and contributes to engaged \r\nand caring young people. Investing in education \r\ninfrastructure and opening avenues of employment \r\ngives young people hope for the future, while growing \r\nsustainable, people-centred economies. Nelson \r\nMandela was clear when he said that there can be no \r\nkeener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in \r\nwhich it treats its children, and so it is incumbent upon \r\nus to ensure that our children live free in peaceful, \r\nstable and prosperous societies.\r\nAs the global community sets out on the path \r\ntowards the future we want, we would like to reiterate \r\nthat sustainable development cannot be realized \r\nwithout peace, and peace cannot be achieved without \r\nsustainable development. Indeed, conflict prevention is \r\nthe prerequisite for securing a safe and prosperous future \r\nfor our children. Accordingly, the global community \r\nmust channel its energies into settling disputes \r\npeacefully based on negotiation and compromise and in \r\naccordance with respect for sovereign equality.\r\nIn line with Nelson Mandela’s thinking that to live \r\nfree is to live in a way that respects and enhances the \r\nfreedom of others, the global community must do its \r\nutmost to fully respect the purposes and principles of \r\nthe United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights and other such relevant instruments. \r\nThis will contribute to peaceful coexistence among \r\nStates and help promote the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level.\r\nAs we celebrate the centenary of the birth of \r\nNelson Mandela, the Royal Government of Cambodia \r\nwould like to reaffirm its commitment to peace. We are \r\nready to work with all our partners to ensure that future \r\ngenerations live free in a stable and prosperous society.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nMrs. Nusseibeh (United Arab Emirates): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank Ireland and the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa for their tireless efforts in facilitating the \r\nconsultations for the political declaration adopted at this \r\nsummit on the occasion of the centennial anniversary \r\nof the birth of Nelson Mandela (resolution 73/1).\r\nIn his autobiography, Nelson Mandela said that on \r\nhis long walk to freedom, he discovered the secret that \r\nafter climbing a great hill one only finds that there are \r\nso many more hills to climb. He dared not linger, for \r\nhis long walk was not yet ended. We here at the United \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 67/86\r\nNations are all too cognizant of the hills we have \r\nyet to climb. In today’s world, with the tremendous \r\nchallenges and widespread crises that we face, we must \r\nremind ourselves of the values of tolerance, compassion \r\nand acceptance that bind us. These are the values that \r\nMr. Mandela not only fought for but embodied in \r\nhis leadership. The United Arab Emirates therefore \r\ndeeply values the opportunity to honour leaders such \r\nas Mandela for their humanity, leaders who fought to \r\nadvance these values and bring peace and justice not \r\nonly to their own societies, but also around the world.\r\nMr. Mandela sought to make the world a better \r\nplace and champion just causes and human rights for \r\nall. He believed in the rights of people everywhere \r\nto self-determination, the importance of the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes and the imperative of abiding by \r\nthe United Nations Charter and international law. These \r\nprinciples are the same ones that our leadership in the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates believe in and work to uphold \r\naround the world. In fact, Mr. Mandela shared a close \r\npersonal relationship with the founding father and first \r\nPresident of the United Arab Emirates, His Highness \r\nSheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, which was based \r\non their life-long dedication to humanitarianism and \r\nshared values that they worked to advance not only in \r\ntheir respective countries, but around the world.\r\nNot only did they share this enlightened vision, \r\nthey shared a birth year: 2018 is the centennial of \r\nboth Mr. Mandela’s and Sheikh Zayed’s births. Our \r\nnation therefore celebrates the shared centenary of \r\nthese two great leaders this year, and on occasions like \r\ntoday’s, it is necessary not only to remind ourselves of \r\nthe values and principles established by our leaders, \r\nbut also to invest in these values so as to strengthen \r\nour international efforts to build peace, strength and \r\nsecurity and to fight poverty, racism and persecution \r\nwherever they exist.\r\nTo that end, the United Arab Emirates believes that \r\nwe must focus on the following core principles espoused \r\nby Mr. Mandela. First, we must intensify efforts aimed \r\nat combating extremism and terrorism and promote a \r\nculture based on tolerance and acceptance. Secondly, \r\nwe must strengthen diplomacy to resolve conflicts, \r\nincluding through dialogue, confidence-building \r\namong Governments and support for the United Nations. \r\nThirdly, we must empower women and young people to \r\nmake them effective partners in building peaceful and \r\ninclusive societies. Fourthly, we must resolve the root \r\ncauses of crises rather than simply managing them. In \r\nthis regard, we must promote innovation and the use of \r\ntechnology to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Finally, we must renew the commitments \r\nof States to international law and the United Nations \r\nCharter, which includes holding States that violate \r\nprinciples and norms truly accountable for their actions.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates will continue to promote \r\nthese steps through its foreign policy and international \r\nleadership and to work with the United Nations \r\nand regional and international partners to advance \r\ndevelopment, prosperity and progress for all people and \r\nto build a more peaceful future for generations to come.\r\nAs Sheikh Zayed said,\r\n“There is no glory without the glory of the country \r\nand its citizens. We have to be proud of our \r\nforefathers, who were able to face the harshness of \r\nlife with a strong will and dedication to shape a \r\nbetter collective future”.\r\nIt is in precisely that spirit that today we honour Nelson \r\nMandela, who, more than most of us can imagine, \r\nfaced the harshness of life, but whose compassion, \r\nrighteousness and goodness inspire us to carry his \r\nwork forward.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Thailand.\r\nMr. Prongthura (Thailand): I am honoured to be \r\nhere today, representing the Kingdom of Thailand, at \r\nthis gathering to commemorate Mr. Mandela’s self less \r\ncontribution to the greater good of humankind and to \r\njoin others in expressing our determination to follow \r\nin his footsteps in our collective pursuit to sustain \r\nglobal peace.\r\nTo achieve what Mr. Mandela started, we have to \r\npromote a culture of peace and non-violence. We have \r\nto foster mutual respect, tolerance and understanding \r\namong peoples. If and when conflict inevitably arises, \r\nour efforts to bring about reconciliation must be \r\nbased upon wisdom and truth, not on repression or \r\nsuppression. True reconciliation must be accompanied \r\nby acceptance and forgiveness. Peace will stand a \r\nbetter chance if lessons are learned and mistakes are \r\nnot repeated.\r\nWe must realize that conflict is born out of \r\nhuman minds and occurs when people are not free \r\nof fear or want. To prevent and to end conflict, we \r\nmust free people from fear. We must also free people \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n68/86 18-29599\r\nfrom want, and we need to protect human rights \r\nand ensure that people live with dignity. We need to \r\npromote development so that humankind can reach \r\nits potential. We must also recognize that peace is \r\nnot just about the absence of conflict. Peace can be \r\nsustained only by addressing the root causes of conflict \r\nthrough inclusive and participatory dialogue. We must \r\ntherefore encourage multi-stakeholder engagement \r\nand constructive partnerships in which everyone has a \r\nchance to contribute actively to lasting peace and their \r\nown futures. We must also pass the values of sustaining \r\npeace on to our children, for they are the agents of \r\nchange that will shape the future of this world.\r\nTo keep the torch of Mr. Mandela’s aspiration \r\nburning, Thailand will always support the work of the \r\nUnited Nations on sustaining peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We will continue to work to realize \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and to leave no \r\none behind.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Italy.\r\nMrs. Zappia (Italy): It is an honour for me to \r\naddress this Peace Summit dedicated to the memory of \r\nNelson Mandela, a man who shaped the history of our \r\ntime. He truly embodied the values enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nIn Madiba we do not only celebrate the unrelenting \r\nleader of the struggle, we also remember him for the \r\nway he pursued peace and reconciliation with those who \r\npersecuted him the most, and for how he led the way to \r\nthe refoundation of South Africa as the rainbow nation.\r\nThroughout his life, President Mandela’s actions \r\nwere always guided by the objectives of ending war and \r\nmaintaining peace and security in the world, affirming \r\njustice and social progress and promoting human rights \r\nand dignity. Protecting and promoting human rights is \r\na priority for Italy. Italy’s candidature for the Human \r\nRights Council for the term 2019-2021 is based on that \r\ncommitment. We are inspired by Nelson Mandela’s \r\nexample in our commitment against all forms of \r\ndiscrimination; in promoting the rights of women and \r\nchildren; implementing the universal moratorium on \r\nthe death penalty; promoting religious freedom and \r\nprotecting the rights of religious minorities; fighting \r\nagainst human trafficking; promoting the rights of \r\npersons with disabilities; protecting human rights \r\ndefenders; and protecting cultural heritage.\r\nIn our efforts to promote the dignity of the \r\nindividual and fight human trafficking, we are among \r\nthose that believe that migration is a global phenomenon \r\nthat cannot be managed by one country alone. Building \r\non our experience, Italy has contributed to the global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration, \r\nwhich is based on respect for the fundamental human \r\nrights of migrating persons, shared responsibility and \r\ntrue partnerships among countries of origin, transit \r\nand destination.\r\nAs a son of the African continent, Nelson \r\nMandela was instrumental in laying the groundwork \r\nfor the relationship between Africa and the rest of \r\nthe world. Because of our history, geography and \r\ncultural traditions, Italy has always had a strong and \r\nprofound relationship with Africa. Over the years, our \r\ndevelopment cooperation has led us to devote significant \r\nresources to the continent and, because we believe in \r\nAfrica’s future, Italy is the sixth-largest investor in the \r\ncontinent. Italy is also assisting many African countries \r\nwith training and capacity-building programmes, from \r\nLibya to the Sahel and the Horn, in different areas, as \r\nidentified in agreement with local authorities and in \r\nfull respect of the principle of African ownership of \r\ncrisis management.\r\nThe upcoming Italy-Africa ministerial conference, \r\nwhich represents the highest-level structured \r\nframework of the partnership established between \r\nItaly and Africa, will take place in Rome on 24 and \r\n25 October. That second conference will be a further \r\noccasion to celebrate Nelson Mandela’s legacy. It will \r\nfocus on Africa’s economic growth; our enhanced \r\nconcerted efforts to promote peace on the continent; and \r\nthe promotion of human development. That high-level \r\ndialogue will enable us to strengthen the cooperation \r\nbetween Italy and Africa towards reaching the goals \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nAgenda 2063 of the African Union.\r\nToday, I want to reaffirm Italy’s strong commitment \r\nto building on Nelson Mandela’s legacy as a driving \r\nforce of our collective efforts towards peace, justice \r\nand prosperity. On the centenary of his birth, I wish \r\nto pay homage to all the women and men who walked \r\ntogether with him towards freedom and justice.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Myanmar.\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 69/86\r\nU Aung Lynn (Myanmar): Allow me first to join \r\nother speakers in commending the President for having \r\nconvened this very important Peace Summit.\r\nMyanmar wishes to endorse the statements \r\ndelivered by the representative of Singapore, on behalf \r\nof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and \r\nby the representative of Venezuela, on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (see A/73/PV.5).\r\nWe also express our appreciation to the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of South Africa and Ireland for having \r\nfacilitated the political declaration adopted at this \r\nSummit (resolution 73/1). Myanmar pays tribute to the \r\ngreat contribution of Nelson Mandela, Madiba, for his \r\nlong struggle for freedom in South Africa and for his \r\naspiration and dedication to promoting the culture of \r\npeace throughout the entire world.\r\nAs we honour the centenary of the birth of Nelson \r\nMandela, we fondly remember his words on peace \r\nand reconciliation:\r\n“In the end, reconciliation is a spiritual process \r\nwhich requires more than just a legal framework. \r\nIt has to happen in the hearts and minds of people”.\r\nThose valuable words are very precious to us, as \r\nMyanmar is working very hard to achieve lasting peace \r\nthrough national reconciliation with a view to building \r\na democratic federal union.\r\nFurthermore, in support of Nelson Mandela’s \r\nefforts to achieve the total elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons, Myanmar is pleased to inform the Assembly \r\nthat we signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons during the treaty event held during the \r\nseventy-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nMay I conclude by saying that the people of \r\nMyanmar will always remember Nelson Mandela as the \r\nchampion of peace, democracy and social justice. We \r\nexpress our strong support for Madiba’s spirit of peace \r\nand reconciliation, which will remain as his lasting \r\nlegacy for our future generations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Philippines.\r\nMr. Locsin (Philippines): It is an absolute honour \r\nand privilege to be here today at the Nelson Mandela \r\nPeace Summit, not only to honour one of the most \r\ninfluential political figures that the world has seen, but \r\nalso to commemorate his legacy as a freedom fighter, \r\na nation-builder and a global icon through the political \r\ndeclaration that all Member States adopted this morning \r\n(resolution 73/1).\r\nNelson Mandela, or Madiba, embodied the highest \r\nideals of humanity: courage and compassion, humility \r\nand harmony, intelligence and integrity, respect and \r\nreconciliation, tolerance and a total commitment to \r\njustice. From prisoner to President, Mandela’s larger-\r\nthan-life story is about the power of reconciliation. He \r\ndemonstrated that hope is a powerful weapon, a peaceful \r\nforce for peace. He displayed strength of character \r\nand steely determination to overcome apartheid. He \r\nshowed, in the face of cruelty and injustice, what \r\nis truly possible when the rule of law triumphs over \r\nprejudice. It is said that Mr. Mandela credited his prison \r\nexperience with teaching him the strategies that would \r\nmake him President, for in weakness there is strength \r\nand in defeat, one finds the means to a greater victory.\r\nEighteen years ago, New York City warmly \r\nwelcomed Mr. Mandela. Almost a million New Yorkers \r\nlined the streets of Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens \r\nto catch a glimpse of the man. As the first President \r\nof post-apartheid South Africa, Mr. Mandela delivered \r\na landmark speech before the General Assembly, \r\nstating  that:\r\n“The millions across our globe who stand \r\nexpectant at the gates of hope look to this \r\nOrganization to bring them peace, to bring them \r\nlife, to bring them a life worth living.” (A/49/PV.14, \r\np. 10)\r\nPresident Mandela paid a State visit to the \r\nPhilippines in March 1998. Ever since then, Filipinos \r\nhave looked up to Mr. Mandela as the inspiration for \r\naction for the betterment of humankind. He never \r\nstopped working on the things that matter. On the \r\noccasion of his birthday in July 2007, Mr. Mandela \r\nfounded The Elders in Johannesburg as a group of \r\nindependent global leaders. He mandated the group to \r\nsupport courage where there is fear, foster agreement \r\nwhere there is conflict, and inspire hope where there \r\nis despair.\r\nMr. Mandela embodied the highest values of the \r\nUnited Nations — social justice, the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights, the fight against poverty \r\nand discrimination and, always, peace and freedom \r\nforemost. The life and legacy of Madiba is about self-\r\nsacrifice, constructive reconciliation and an unwavering \r\ncommitment to freedom. These are pursuits that are \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n70/86 18-29599\r\ndifficult to attain but, as Mandela might say, it always \r\nseems impossible until it is done.\r\nThe challenges for all of us remain: to envision all \r\npossibilities where none seems to exist and to continue \r\nto work for a just, inclusive and better world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Oman.\r\nMr. Al Towaiya (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nToday I am addressing the Assembly on behalf of the \r\ndelegation of my country, the Sultanate of Oman. We \r\nare participating in this important session focusing on \r\nglobal peace to commemorate the birth centenary of \r\nthe late Nelson Mandela, who was well known for his \r\ncourage, humanity and tolerance.\r\nWe participate in this Summit today because we \r\nhave high regard for our relations with friendly South \r\nAfrica. We commend Mandela’s strong human and \r\nethical values, which made him an international leader \r\nwho transcended his country and continent. He devoted \r\nhimself to the service of humankind and humanitarian \r\nissues and to promoting the culture of peace throughout \r\nthe world while supporting Arab causes, in particular \r\nthe Palestinian question.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to mention that Nelson \r\nMandela paid a visit to the Sultanate in 1999, during \r\nwhich he met with His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin \r\nSaid. That visit marked an important milestone in the \r\nbilateral relations between the Sultanate and South \r\nAfrica — a relationship that we greatly value.\r\nThis Summit is an opportunity for us to reflect on \r\nthe life and legacy of the late Nelson Mandela, as it \r\nreminds us of the responsibility of the United Nations \r\nto achieve and maintain peace.\r\nA few days ago, my country underscored from this \r\nrostrum that dialogue and negotiations are the best \r\nmeans of finding solutions to conflicts and that peace \r\nis the very foundation of stability and development. \r\nNelson Mandela affirmed this belief by saying:\r\n“Negotiations and discussion are the \r\ngreatest weapons we have for promoting peace \r\nand development”.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Ukraine.\r\nMr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): Ukraine appreciates the \r\ninitiative to hold this Summit. It is a timely opportunity \r\nfor Member States and the United Nations leadership \r\nto consider measures to promote peace, security and \r\nhuman rights and their interconnection, as well as \r\nthe role played by Nelson Mandela in shaping the \r\nmodern world.\r\nMandela’s legacy proves that the power of personal \r\ncourage, integrity, self-confidence, self-sacrifice and \r\nleadership can be much more powerful than the power \r\nof a country. The speech that Nelson Mandela gave \r\nthe day he walked out of prison reaffirmed the same \r\ndemands he made to the Government on the day he \r\nwas sentenced to jail. After 27 years, he walked out of \r\nprison proud and unbroken. Despite 27 years in jail, he \r\nknew that anger could tear his country further apart, so \r\ninstead he chose nation-building over revenge.\r\n“Recognize that the world is hungry for action, not \r\nwords. Act with courage and vision.”\r\nThese are the words of a true leader.\r\nUkraine is proud to always have been true friend \r\nand defender of human rights, especially at the time \r\nof the Republic of South Africa’s first democratic \r\npresidential elections, in 1994, when Nelson Mandela \r\nwas elected President. Ukraine was also actively \r\nengaged in the activities of the United Nations Special \r\nCommittee against Apartheid and served as Vice-Chair \r\nof that body for many years in ensuring the restoration \r\nof justice in South Africa.\r\nIn this connection, let me recall — as just one \r\nelement of this — the unique experience of Ukraine’s \r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nin Africa, including in Sierra Leone, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, South \r\nSudan and the Sudan.\r\nNowadays, despite foreign aggression, Ukraine \r\nis continuing with its proud duty as a contributor to \r\npeacekeeping operations in the African region. Looking \r\nback on the more than 25 years of history of Ukraine’s \r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping activities, \r\nI am particularly proud that Blue Helmets from \r\nUkraine were a part of the operations that contributed \r\nso much to peace in Africa, from the introduction of \r\nrobust peacekeeping in Côte d’Ivoire to the most recent \r\nsuccess story, in Liberia. We remain a reliable partner \r\nof the United Nations and of Africa in this endeavour.\r\nFurthermore, increased attention on the part of the \r\nSecurity Council to peacemaking and peacebuilding on \r\nthe African continent was among the main priorities for \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 71/86\r\nUkraine during its non-permanent membership in that \r\nbody in 2016-2017.\r\nPeace and security and respect for human rights \r\nare closely linked. We support those who declare that \r\nhuman rights violations must be considered as an early \r\nwarning of future instability and conflicts, and we are \r\ncommitted to ensuring that greater attention is given to \r\nhuman rights during discussions in the relevant United \r\nNations formats. In this regard, Ukraine has consistently \r\npromoted Human Rights Council resolutions on the \r\nrole of prevention in the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nTurning back to Nelson Mandela, we are glad that \r\nhis heritage continues to enrich the world, even after \r\nhis passing. A true recognition of his personal strength \r\nwas the adoption of the revised United Nations Standard \r\nMinimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners in 2015, \r\nalso known as the Nelson Mandela Rules. It is a true \r\nhonour for all of us to share the legacy of Madiba today.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Lithuania.\r\nMs. Plepytė (Lithuania): It is an honour for me \r\nto participate in this high-level event dedicated to \r\npromoting the legacy of Nelson Mandela. Because of \r\nhis determination to fight for what is right, Nelson \r\nMandela has become a synonym for tolerance, \r\nnon-discrimination, dialogue and reconciliation, peace \r\nand stability, respect for diversity and the promotion \r\nof human rights. These are the values that humankind \r\nsorely needs in today’s world.\r\nBy celebrating the life and legacy of Nelson \r\nMandela, we are commemorating the anniversary of the \r\nmost important human rights instrument, the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Nelson Mandela \r\ndevoted his life to the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights. He fought against racial and other \r\nforms of discrimination and promoted gender equality \r\nand the rights of children and people in vulnerable \r\nsituations — all of the rights enshrined in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\r\nIn looking at the legacy of Nelson Mandela to future \r\ngenerations, we should ask ourselves if we have done \r\neverything to preserve and promote human rights. Have \r\nwe been able to step outside of our comfort zones and \r\nuphold the international principles of equality, justice \r\nand human dignity? These questions are essential today.\r\nThe democratic space is shrinking, and human \r\nrights are being denied by the falsification of security \r\nneeds. Populism also plays a part when human rights \r\nare limited in the pursuit of fake promises. Neither \r\nsustainable peace nor security can be achieved without \r\nrespect for human rights and those who defend them. We \r\nmust recommit to the ideals enshrined in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and revive the values that \r\nNelson Mandela stood for.\r\nLithuania is committed to the goals set out in \r\nthe Political Declaration (resolution 73/1), which can \r\nprovide new impetus for the promotion of Nelson \r\nMandela’s legacy. We must strive for just, peaceful, \r\nprosperous, democratic and equitable societies based on \r\nthe rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights \r\nand freedoms. The best way to celebrate the centenary \r\nof Nelson Mandela’s birth is with a commitment to \r\nbuilding total, just and lasting peace with unconditional \r\ntolerance, understanding and reconciliation in \r\nour relations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Latvia.\r\nMr. Pildegovičs (Latvia): It is an honour to be part \r\nof the commemoration of the legacy of Nelson Mandela \r\non his centenary. He was a man of great wisdom and \r\ncourage who has become a global symbol of freedom \r\nand peace. He continues to inspire all generations. It is \r\nvery important that, at a time when we are facing many \r\nglobal challenges, we all come together to reflect on the \r\nmuch-needed global peace strongly pursued by Nelson \r\nMandela throughout his lifetime. Latvia supports the \r\npolitical declaration adopted at this Summit (resolution \r\n73/1), and we hope that all countries will embrace the \r\nprinciples and values therein.\r\nPeace cannot be taken for granted. It is at risk in \r\nmany places around the globe, with conflicts, tensions \r\nand terrorism leaving serious wounds on our collective \r\nconsciousness. We must fight for peace. We must \r\ntranslate our commitments to end conflicts and the \r\ndevastation of our peoples into clear priorities and \r\nconcrete actions. Nelson Mandela said:\r\n“It always seems impossible until it is done”\r\nand\r\n“real leaders must be ready to sacrifice all for the \r\nfreedom of their peoples”.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n72/86 18-29599\r\nIn the early 1990s, Nelson Mandela rejected \r\nviolence and steered South Africa — a country in \r\nturmoil — towards a negotiated settlement aimed at \r\nending the era of apartheid and lay the foundation for \r\nreconciliation and a truly inclusive democracy. These \r\ntransformational changes in South Africa occurred \r\nalongside the historic liberation of the former captive \r\nnations in Central and Eastern Europe. During the \r\npeaceful and non-violent independence movement \r\nknown as the Singing Revolution, the peoples of \r\nLatvia, Estonia and Lithuania ultimately succeeded \r\nin overcoming the brutal foreign occupation and \r\ntotalitarian regime that had lasted for more than \r\n50 years.\r\nSince the restoration of its independence and joining \r\nthe United Nations in September 1991, Latvia has been \r\na staunch supporter of international law and promoter \r\nof democracy and human rights. These principles are \r\nfundamental in maintaining an international order \r\nbased on predictability, stability and the security of \r\nStates. There are great expectations for the United \r\nNations, as the only truly universal organization, to \r\nmeet the growing challenges to peace, development \r\nand human rights and deliver results effectively. Latvia \r\nis a strong advocate of multilateralism and believes \r\nthat we must all work together to restore trust in the \r\nmultilateral system’s ability to deliver solutions to \r\npressing global issues.\r\nLatvia sees conflict prevention as the backbone of \r\nthe United Nations agenda. As we mark the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, it is important to remind ourselves that human \r\nrights and the promotion of tolerance within society \r\nare the best tools for the prevention of violent conflict, \r\nbecause inclusive societies guarantee peace and security. \r\nWith an effective and accountable justice system and \r\ninstitutions in place and with fundamental freedoms, \r\nincluding freedom of speech and association, every \r\nsociety can thrive. Latvia will continue to promote and \r\nprotect these values both at home and internationally.\r\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, \r\ncombatants accounted for 90 per cent of conflict-\r\nrelated casualties. Today 90 per cent of casualties in \r\narmed conflicts are civilians. Conventional weapons \r\nkill approximately 500,000 people per year, 70,000 of \r\nthem in conflict zones. These figures clearly prove that \r\nthe international community must focus not only on \r\nweapons of mass destruction, but also on conventional \r\nweapons. With that in mind, Latvia will assume the \r\npresidency of the Arms Trade Treaty next year and will \r\nspare no effort to promote its objectives. I call on all \r\nStates to become parties to the Treaty, which would also \r\ncontribute directly to the legacy of Nelson Mandela and \r\nto the attainment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment’s Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThis year Latvia is celebrating the centenary of the \r\nmodern democratic republic. Latvia’s greatest resource \r\nis our people. Those who sacrificed their lives for \r\nfreedom and those who have dedicated their lives to the \r\ncreation and maintenance of an independent State have \r\ncreated our present reality with the work they do on a \r\ndaily basis. Together with the new generation, they are \r\nlaying the foundation for our future.\r\nTo reiterate my message I would like to quote the \r\ngreat Latvian poet Rainis, who said in 1911, “We are as \r\ngreat as is our will”.\r\nThe awareness of this simple truth has followed \r\nLatvians through an entire century of joy and suffering, \r\ndestruction and renewal. This simple, succinct truth \r\nexpresses the essence of our national will: belief in our \r\nstrength and the desire to be free. Today we can also \r\nachieve all that we believe in.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan.\r\nMr. Hashmi (Pakistan): Nelson Mandela’s name \r\nis synonymous with struggle, reconciliation, peaceful \r\ncoexistence and respect for others. His charisma, stoic \r\noptimism and undying spirit to help the oppressed made \r\nhim one of the world’s most recognizable statesmen \r\nof the twentieth century and a hero of South African \r\ndemocracy. His legacy continues to reverberate around \r\nthe world. As we are gathered here to celebrate that \r\ngreat statesman, who stood for peace and unity, we \r\nsee around us a world that is hardly at peace and in \r\nwhich conflicts abound, human rights abuses remain \r\nrampant and humanitarian laws are f louted in open \r\nviolation of the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. We must learn from Madiba and see how his \r\nlegacy can guide us in navigating the troubled waters of \r\ninternational peace and security today.\r\nOne of Nelson Mandela’s priorities was ending \r\npoverty. Despite the important progress made in \r\nour fight against extreme poverty, hunger, illiteracy \r\nand disease, the dividends of those gains continue \r\nto be unequally distributed. Inequality, exclusion \r\nand lack of opportunity continue to blight the hopes \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 73/86\r\nand aspirations of millions of people, especially \r\nwomen and girls. Similarly, internecine violence and \r\nconflict continue to undermine the prospects of peace \r\nand stability throughout many parts of the world. \r\nProtracted conflicts have also spawned unprecedented \r\nhumanitarian crises, if not emergencies. Prolonged \r\nconflicts cannot be wished away. The Jammu-Kashmir \r\ndispute is one such scar on the face of the United \r\nNations. Addressing the Summit Conference of Heads \r\nof State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in \r\nDurban in 1998, Mandela said,\r\n “All of us remain concerned that the issue of Jammu \r\nand Kashmir should be solved through peaceful \r\nnegotiations and should be willing to lend all the \r\nstrength we have to the resolution of this matter”.\r\nWe must pay heed to such voices if we are serious about \r\npeace and Mandela’s legacy.\r\nAt a time when international cooperation is most \r\nneeded to address the myriad interrelated and mutually \r\nreinforcing challenges, the world is becoming more \r\ndivided and polarized. Mandela devoted his life to \r\nthe service of his people and humankind, and he did \r\nso at great personal sacrifice. He chose the path of \r\nreconciliation and cooperation, while leaving behind a \r\npowerful legacy of reconciliation and diversity together \r\nwith resistance to economic and other inequalities. We \r\nmust use the power of peace and reconciliation and \r\nlearn about the importance of forgiveness and respect \r\nfor the dignity of all people. The greatest tribute that \r\nwe can pay him is to carry on his message of hope and \r\ncontinue to defend the values for which he stood. That is \r\nnot an easy task, but let us always remember Madiba’s \r\noften-quoted lesson:\r\n“It always seems impossible until it is done”.\r\nLet us pledge to work with that undying spirit.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Burundi.\r\nMr. Shingiro (Burundi) (spoke in French): Burundi \r\nwelcomes the convening on 24 September of the \r\nhigh-level plenary meeting entitled “Nelson Mandela \r\nPeace Summit”, organized, as all here are aware, in \r\naccordance with resolution 72/243, of 22 December \r\n2017, which my country, Burundi, fully endorsed. \r\nThrough the holding of this summit, held following the \r\ncentenary of his birth, on 18 July, Burundi pays a well-\r\ndeserved tribute to a statesman who made his mark on \r\nworld history through his dedication to the struggle \r\nfor freedom, equality and dignity not only for South \r\nAfrica, but also for the entire world.\r\nAs a result of his singular achievements, Madiba’s \r\nlight continues to shine brightly throughout the world, \r\nburning through every cloud. Nelson Mandela’s \r\nexemplary sense of courage, determination, love, self-\r\nsacrifice and compassion continues to be a source of \r\ninspiration for the entire world. His legacy shows us the \r\npath ahead and encourages us to pursue the struggle \r\nto achieve equality, dignity and justice with the same \r\ndedication and tenacity that he demonstrated throughout \r\nhis entire life, without ever showing any sign of fatigue \r\nor resignation despite the 27 long years he spent in \r\nprison. In his youth, Nelson Mandela preferred to devote \r\nhis energy to forgiveness and reconciliation, working \r\ntowards realizing his model of a peaceful, multi-ethnic, \r\nmulticultural, democratic and definitively unified and \r\nreconciled South Africa. He is today the indisputable \r\nsymbol of shared universal values such as peace, \r\nforgiveness, humility, integrity, patience, generosity, \r\nrespect and sincerity, among countless others.\r\nBurundi also welcomes the fact that every year on \r\n18 July, Nelson Mandela International Day provides us \r\nwith a unique opportunity to reflect on the legacy of that \r\niconic figure in the struggle for liberty, in particular his \r\ncall for solidarity and mutually respectful international \r\ncooperation. It is that sense of duty towards others that \r\ndrove Nelson Mandela to risk his life to save the lives of \r\nothers. He confronted his oppressors while in prison, in \r\ncourt and in the street, knowing full well that they had \r\nthe power of life or death over him. He refused to back \r\ndown or resign himself despite the peril that hovered \r\nover him. He sacrificed a major part of his life so that \r\nothers could live in peace, dignity, freedom, tolerance, \r\nequality and mutual respect among the formerly \r\noppressed and those who had oppressed them. He was \r\nan infallible guide lighting the way and today remains \r\nan example for the whole world to follow, as we strive \r\nto pursue his work in the service of humankind. The \r\nbest way of paying him well-deserved tribute would be \r\nto reverse the current trends towards the fragmentation \r\nand polarization of the international community through \r\ndynamic, sincere and equitable multilateralism.\r\nIn conclusion, I would be remiss if I did not remind \r\nthe Assembly that, throughout his struggle, Nelson \r\nMandela showed us that dialogue and negotiations must \r\nbe pursued tirelessly, regardless of the nature of the \r\ndivisions in question. All the peoples of the world have \r\nthe opportunity today to remember Mandela’s legacy, \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n74/86 18-29599\r\nwhich is written in words of gold. His charisma, unifying \r\nleadership, integrity, humility, sincerity and combative \r\nspirit for achieving freedom, equality and dignity for \r\nall led to the liberation of the people of South Africa \r\nfrom the yoke of the racist apartheid regime and that of \r\nother Africans from repressive regimes. In that regard, \r\nthe people of Burundi are particularly grateful to him \r\nfor his personal commitment to the inter-Burundi peace \r\nprocess, which led to the Arusha Peace Agreement \r\nin 2000, the subsequent comprehensive ceasefire \r\nagreements and the end of a years-long civil war pitting \r\nthe people of Burundi against their brothers.\r\nOn the occasion of the Nelson Mandela Peace \r\nSummit, let us all, as an international community, \r\ntake advantage of this opportunity to condemn and \r\nreject the rise of intolerance, hatred, racism, prejudice, \r\ndiscrimination and the trend of radical unilateralism in \r\norder to make our world a haven of peace where the \r\npeoples of the world may live and cooperate in perfect \r\nharmony and in complementarity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Chile.\r\nMr. Skoknic Tapia (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Five \r\nyears after the passing of Nelson Mandela, the best \r\ntribute we can pay to his legacy is to gather here at a \r\nPeace Summit that bears his name. The perspective that \r\nMandela’s birth gives us allows us to be mindful of the \r\nchanges in the notion of peace and security, especially \r\nin terms of the threats thereto.\r\nThis occasion is also an opportunity for all of us to \r\nreaffirm our commitment to the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights on its seventieth anniversary. To a \r\nlarge extent, traditional threats to peace and security \r\nhave been replaced by new threats that are not always \r\nof a State or military nature — a paradigm change that \r\nhas convinced us that a multidimensional approach \r\nis the best way to address conflicts. Causes include \r\nsocioeconomic, gender-related, ethnic, tribal, religious \r\nand ideological tensions that may have a local, regional \r\nor global impact. Such a multidimensional approach, \r\nwith an emphasis on prevention, allows us to see \r\nthat peace is intimately linked to development. As \r\nthe Assembly has reiterated on multiple occasions, \r\nsustainable development cannot be achieved without \r\npeace and security, while peace and security are at risk \r\nwithout the achievement of sustainable development. \r\nChile is of the view that peace and development are \r\nclosely linked, and, in the light of the foregoing, a \r\ncooperative approach with a broad vision is essential \r\nwhen dealing with threats of a global nature. Chile is \r\ntherefore firmly committed to cooperating, through \r\nits technical and human resources, in all multilateral, \r\nuniversal and regional forums in order to contribute to \r\nresolving the problems that threaten nations.\r\nIn terms of development cooperation, one of the \r\nways that Chile remembers Nelson Mandela is through \r\nthe scholarship bearing his name. The objective of \r\nthat scholarship and that collaboration is to contribute \r\nto the development of advanced human capital for \r\nAfrica, allowing students from all over that continent \r\nto graduate from Chilean universities. Since the \r\nscholarship’s creation, in 2014, more than 100 students \r\nfrom the African continent have benefited therefrom.\r\nI would conclude by saying that Chile is a peaceful \r\ncountry that is resolutely committed to globalization \r\nand to a world order that, to be legitimate, must be \r\nconsistently governed by multilaterally negotiated \r\nrules. Our outward-looking development model requires \r\nglobal conditions of peace and security that effectively \r\nallow the widest possible circulation of people, goods \r\nand services.\r\nWe view international security as a global public \r\ngood that must be provided by all States, whatever their \r\nsize, population or military power. For that reason, we \r\nbelieve that all members of the international community \r\nshould participate in the quest for global solutions to \r\nmajor global threats.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the United States of America.\r\nMr. McCulley (United States of America): It is a \r\ngreat honour to be here today as we celebrate the life \r\nand accomplishments of Nelson Mandela, who devoted \r\nalmost 70 years of his life to helping to transform South \r\nAfrica into a better version of itself and who left the \r\nworld a legacy to cherish and remember. As one of \r\nthe twentieth century’s greatest visionaries, Nelson \r\nMandela demonstrated to the world the strength of \r\nthe human spirit to overcome adversity. His legacy \r\ntranscends boundaries and will continue to bring \r\npeople closer for generations to come in the fight for \r\njustice and equality around the world.\r\nNelson Mandela was no stranger to immense \r\nadversity and hardship. And yet he never stopped \r\npursuing the justice and equality that he knew all \r\npeople deserve. Madiba fought to defend a universal \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 75/86\r\nhuman dignity and to create a brighter future for \r\nsucceeding generations. This Summit is a powerful \r\nmanifestation of President Mandela’s vision of the world \r\ncoming together and recognizing, amid our profound \r\ndisagreements, the universality of our common cause \r\nto build a better future for humankind.\r\nThrough holding this event, we are better and more \r\nappropriately able to honour the memory of Nelson \r\nMandela by improving the world. Despite decades of \r\nimprisonment, Nelson Mandela’s belief in freedom and \r\nhuman dignity was unbreakable. He maintained his \r\nfaith, not only in his cause but in the humanity of his \r\nfellow countrymen, including his oppressors. President \r\nMandela demonstrated that even after enduring \r\nunimaginable adversity, great leaders can govern with \r\nfairness and honesty and build a better future for their \r\ncountries and for humankind.\r\nPresident Mandela also did not shy away from \r\nshining a spotlight on corruption and the abuse of power. \r\nIn April 1964, in his famous speech, entitled: “I am \r\nprepared to die”, given from the defence dock in a trial \r\nwhere he faced the real possibility of a death sentence, \r\nhe publicly indicted a corrupt and unjust system of \r\nState-sponsored oppression. He knew instinctively that \r\nfocusing public attention on oppression and injustice \r\nwould turn opinion towards the peacemaker and human \r\nrights activist. He knew that the inherent fairness and \r\ndecency of informed human beings would lead to the \r\ndefeat of tyranny, the spread of democracy and the \r\ndevelopment of strong, just institutions that preserve \r\nthe rights of every citizen. We have expressed our \r\nconcerns with parts of the political declaration that was \r\nadopted last week, and we will continue to share our \r\nviews on a host of issues in the weeks to come. But let \r\nus proceed under the wisdom of Mandela’s legacy to \r\nelevate the objectives of our dialogue.\r\nThrough Nelson Mandela’s example, we know that \r\nchange can occur when actions and messages of respect \r\nand peace are used instead of violence and division. \r\nMay we ever strive to follow and continue to learn \r\nfrom Nelson Mandela on how we should forgive when \r\nit comes to the past and forge ahead towards a future \r\nwhere all humankind can share rights and privileges \r\nthat are not reserved solely for the few. Nelson Mandela \r\nwas a beacon of hope in this world and a testament to \r\nthe fact that peace and profound growth are possible \r\nanywhere. In honour of the Nelson Mandela Peace \r\nSummit, we join our fellow representatives in reflecting \r\non his legacy of striving for progress, peace, justice and \r\nequality for all.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Poland.\r\nMr. Radomski (Poland): I am honoured and \r\nproud to represent Poland at the Nelson Mandela \r\nPeace Summit. Indeed, this is a particularly important \r\noccasion, not only for our dear friends and partners \r\nfrom South Africa but — I will not hesitate to say \r\nit — for all the people of the world.\r\nNelson Mandela’s personality and his legacy of \r\npeaceful transformation from the oppressive apartheid \r\nregime to a democratic South Africa remind me of \r\ntwo dates from our own Polish history. Some moments \r\nduring the past century were surprisingly similar to \r\nthe long walk to freedom of South Africa and other \r\nAfrican countries. A few months after the birth of \r\nNelson Mandela — when the horrors of the First World \r\nWar had just ended — on 11 November 1918 Poland \r\nregained its independence after 123 years of partition \r\nand oppression by the three empires, namely, Russia, \r\nGermany and Austria. This year we therefore celebrate \r\nboth centenaries, of Nelson Mandela’s birth and of the \r\nresurrection of Poland in 1918.\r\nThere are more historical parallels, however. The \r\nyears 1989 and 1994 marked the other important dates \r\nand similarities between Poland and South Africa. \r\nWe Poles threw off the bloody yoke of communism \r\nin 1989, and only five years later Nelson Mandela \r\nbecame the first democratically elected President of \r\nSouth Africa, ending the thoroughly unfair and brutal \r\napartheid regime.\r\nLet me say this clearly and forcefully: the heritage of \r\nNelson Mandela and the histories of both South Africa \r\nand Poland should serve as a reminder and warning for \r\nall those who do not abide by the rules of democracy or \r\nrespect human dignity, the right to self-determination \r\nand the sovereignty of all countries around the world.\r\nLet us remember the great personality and legacy of \r\nNelson Mandela. It should inspire us today to contribute \r\nfurther to a cessation of hostilities and raging wars and \r\nto act against aggression and hatred in our world today, \r\nfor which we are all responsible.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Germany.\r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n76/86 18-29599\r\nMr. Schulz (Germany): I thank the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for convening this high-level \r\nplenary meeting in honour of the centenary of the birth \r\nof Nelson Mandela.\r\nNelson Mandela was a champion in so many \r\nways, and his contributions to overcoming apartheid, \r\ndiscrimination and oppression were legendary. \r\nThe same is true for his dedication to human rights, \r\ndevelopment and freedom. From early on he emphasized \r\nthe importance of empowering women and youth. \r\nToday we are challenged by a new wave of populism, \r\ndiscrimination and violence, as our multilateral order \r\nis increasingly coming under threat. Madiba’s life and \r\nvalues can help guide us through those challenges. This \r\ncommemoration is therefore called to apply his values \r\nand actions to today’s problems.\r\nGermany wholeheartedly supports the declaration \r\nwe adopted last week (resolution 73/1) and thanks South \r\nAfrica and Ireland for their leadership in drafting it.\r\nGermany aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\non behalf of the European Union during the first part \r\nof this meeting.\r\nThe integration of prevention and sustaining peace \r\ninto the work of the United Nations was long overdue. \r\nFor us, prevention is the foundation of building \r\nand sustaining peace. Both are key issues in our \r\nmultilateral work. At the national level Germany has \r\nspelled out its policy on prevention and stabilization \r\nin our guidelines on preventing crisis, resolving \r\nconflict and building peace. This is the first time that \r\nGermany has defined its peace policy in this way: we \r\nare fully committed to the primacy of politics and \r\nthe priority of prevention. We have tripled our budget \r\nfor crisis prevention, stabilization and humanitarian \r\nassistance, and we are proud to currently co-chair the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission.\r\nThe year 2019 will mark the start of the Nelson \r\nMandela Decade of Peace, and Germany will serve on \r\nthe Security Council starting in January. Strengthening \r\nthe Council’s work in conflict prevention and conflict \r\nresolution remains a top priority for Germany. Germany \r\nwill also prioritize human rights and the implementation \r\nof the women and peace and security agenda during our \r\ntime on the Council.\r\nSpeaking about women’s empowerment, I think it is \r\nappropriate to commemorate the struggle of the South \r\nAfrican women who fought alongside Tata Mandela. \r\nI would like to mention one of them in particular, \r\nAlbertina Sisulu. Her life reminds us that women play an \r\nessential role in the struggle for a more peaceful world. \r\nThat belief is why Germany will continue to promote \r\nwomen’s empowerment across the United Nations. That \r\nis how we can carry on the legacy of Nelson Mandela \r\nand his dedication to freedom, democracy, human rights \r\nand the empowerment of women. We believe that they \r\nare the only way to create lasting peace and stability.\r\nIn today’s world, Madiba reminds us all, maybe \r\nmore than ever, that those are the guiding principles \r\nfor the United Nations and that decency is not a sign \r\nof weakness.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Syrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Mounzer (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): The late Nelson Mandela — a great warrior \r\nin South Africa’s struggle and President of that \r\ncountry  —  left us a glorious legacy and is a source \r\nof pride for all peoples opposing foreign occupation, \r\nfighting for their independence and sovereignty over \r\ntheir national territory, and combating terrorism and \r\nextremism. Nelson Mandela spent 27 years of his life \r\nin the apartheid prisons in South Africa. Following his \r\nrelease,  he spent the rest of his life fighting tirelessly to \r\nmaintain freedom and independence in his country, to \r\ndefend it and to defend his values and principles in the \r\nservice of humankind.\r\nMy country, Syria, supported Nelson Mandela and \r\nhis struggle when he was detained in apartheid prisons. \r\nWe are proud to say that we have our own Syrian \r\nMandela, a man by the name of Sidqi Sleiman Al-Makt, \r\na Syrian prisoner who, like Mandela, spent 27 years of \r\nhis life in prison  — Israeli prisons, in his case. He was \r\narrested once again by the Israeli occupying authorities \r\nand sentenced to 14 additional years in prison because \r\nhe exposed Israel’s support for terrorist groups in the \r\ndivided Golan.\r\nRegrettably, the quest for peace will be in vain as \r\nlong as policies exist that support hegemony, occupation \r\nand terrorism while covering up the crimes committed \r\nby terrorists. It will be in vain as long as such policies \r\nimpose unilateral coercive measures amid rising \r\nradicalism and the discourse of hatred and racism.  It \r\nwill be in vain as long as many of our peoples continue \r\nto pay with their blood the price of colonial ambitions, \r\ninternational terrorism and proxy wars, in addition to \r\nillegal alliances that, through their crimes and acts of \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 77/86\r\naggression, undermine the great developmental and \r\nstructural achievements that were achieved over many \r\ndecades. It will be in vain as long as certain States \r\ncontinue to exacerbate and prolong crises in order to \r\nserve their own interests rather than find peaceful \r\nsolutions to them.\r\nUnfortunately, the picture is bleak when we talk \r\nabout world peace in the presence of States that seek \r\nto undermine international peace and security rather \r\nthan maintain it. How many States have been destroyed \r\nunder the pretext of possessing weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, the responsibility to protect or spreading \r\ndemocracy? The list is endless.\r\nThe challenges we face today make our mission \r\nas the United Nations even more difficult and our \r\nresponsibility greater. Consequently, the required \r\ncollective efforts must be intensified to ensure that \r\npeace prevails over hegemony, terrorism, extremism \r\nand hatred. That requires respect for the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter, which \r\nunderscores respect for the sovereignty, territorial \r\nintegrity and political independence of States, as well \r\nas non-interference in their internal affairs.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Chad.\r\nMr. Moustapha (Chad) (spoke in French): I \r\nwelcome the holding of today’s Peace Summit to \r\ncommemorate the centenary of the birth of Nelson \r\nMandela. I am very proud to speak on behalf of my \r\ncountry, Chad, on this occasion to honour the memory \r\nof this great man and leader whom the world continues \r\nto celebrate.\r\nThe stature and political career of Nelson Mandela \r\nserve as an invitation to continue the struggle for our \r\npeoples. Madiba’s commitment to peace, security and \r\nharmony transcended the borders of his country, South \r\nAfrica, and was known throughout the world. That \r\nis why his faith in peace and social justice inspires \r\nus all to take action, in particular in a country such \r\nas Chad, which has experienced decades of conflict. \r\nPeace, security and social justice are yet to be achieved \r\nin many regions, such as the Lake Chad basin region \r\nand the Sahel, where terrorist groups and trafficking \r\nnetworks of all kinds jeopardize the safety of goods \r\nand people and threaten the stability of countries. In \r\naddition, major vulnerabilities and poverty in such \r\nregions are another destabilizing factor in the area of \r\npeace and security. Abject poverty, which forces men \r\nand women to live on less than $1 a day, remains one of \r\nthe greatest injustices of our time.\r\nAlthough resources abound and technical means \r\nexist, food insecurity threatens millions of human \r\nbeings throughout the world. The peaceful world \r\nthat Nelson Mandela ardently advocated is one that \r\neliminates hunger and malnutrition. The peaceful \r\nworld Madiba called for allows children to be housed, \r\neducated and realize their equal right to participate \r\nso as to ensure that peace, harmony, tolerance and \r\ncompassion continue to prevail. The adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063 \r\nof the African Union are responses to the challenges \r\nof poverty and the manifold and multidimensional \r\nthreats. We commend the tireless efforts of the United \r\nNations and the African Union to implement the \r\npromising commitments made under such initiatives. \r\nWe support them because they constitute the best way \r\nto overcome the scourge of poverty and abject poverty \r\nin the world and ensure peace. There can be no peace \r\nwithout development.\r\nHowever, achieving the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals depends entirely upon marshalling financial \r\nresources, without which the 2030 Agenda will \r\nremain but a litany of woes and an unfulfilled list of \r\ndesires. Therefore, on this solemn occasion, we call \r\nupon the donor community and all Member States \r\nto work together to ensure that our world becomes \r\na better place. In doing so we would be honouring \r\nboth the commitments we made and the memory of \r\nNelson Mandela.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Iraq.\r\nMr. Bahr Aluloom (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq, I would like at the outset to express \r\nmy gratitude to those who participated in organizing \r\nthis Peace Summit to commemorate the ideas of the late \r\nleader Nelson Mandela, who said,\r\n“To be free is not merely to cast off your chains, \r\nbut to live in dignity that respects the freedom \r\nof others.”\r\nAs peoples of different States, we live in a \r\ndiversified and multilateral world in terms of cultures, \r\nideologies, religions and ethnicities. Hence we must \r\ndeal with all of those differences based on respect for \r\nthe rights and freedoms of others in order to maintain \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n78/86 18-29599\r\nour own rights and freedoms. Diversity and difference \r\nhave been a way of life from the dawn of creation and \r\nenrich our shared human legacy.\r\nNelson Mandela’s ideals and his struggle against \r\nall forms of racial discrimination in the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa are a beacon that illuminates the path of \r\nall parties pursuing respect for the principles of human \r\nrights as an approach to the future of peoples. The broad \r\nparticipation of the international community at today’s \r\nSummit attests to the fact that Member States have \r\nadopted Mandela’s ideas, given their global nature. We \r\nbelieve that the rule of law requires that procedures and \r\ninstitutions, as well as legal norms, reflect respect for \r\nhuman rights. The rule of law is closely linked to the \r\nprotection of human rights. Human rights can never be \r\nprotected in communities without the rule of law, as \r\nit is the only mechanism that activates such rights in \r\norder to transform them from mere principles to reality, \r\nby laying the foundations of democratic governance on \r\ninternational principles.\r\nThe Iraqi Constitution adopted in 2005 encompasses \r\nthe basic principles that acknowledge a broad range \r\nof rights and freedoms for all people, in line with \r\ninternational humanitarian principles. Our Constitution \r\nprohibits the enactment of any law that contravenes \r\nthe fundamental principles of freedoms and prohibits \r\nany entity or approach that endorses racism, terrorism, \r\ntakfirism or sectarian cleansing.\r\nIn collaboration with the international community \r\nand the United Nations, the Government of Iraq \r\nis working diligently to eradicate the remnants of \r\nextremism that threaten international peace and \r\nsecurity. It does so by implementing institutional reform \r\nprogrammes, fighting all forms of discrimination, \r\nbuilding national capacity, applying the principle of \r\ngender equality, empowering women and youth and \r\nproviding equal opportunities, while also respecting the \r\nmulti-religious, cultural and national features of Iraq. \r\nWe are earnestly pursuing the development of think \r\ntanks in order to develop a human approach aimed at \r\nleading society towards sustainable peace and making \r\nit part and parcel of the daily lives of the Iraqi citizens.\r\nIt is very clear that since 2003 Iraq has lived \r\nthrough an exceptional phase in its socio-political \r\nhistory. It  suffered  an aggressive, racist and terrorist \r\nattack by Al-Qaida and subsequently by Da’esh terrorist \r\ngangs in 2014. They targeted the very existence of the \r\nState and its intellectual system and spilled the blood \r\nof our citizens of all sects and religions. However, the \r\nsynergistic efforts of Iraqis with the support of the \r\ninternational community saved the country from those \r\nterrorist gangs, while preventing them from spreading \r\nto other parts of the region and the world. Terrorism \r\nwas defeated in Mesopotamia. The Government \r\nof Iraq announced last year all-out victory against \r\nsuch criminal gangs. Iraqis understand very well the \r\nprinciples of human rights and how to address them and \r\ninsist that they will be part of their future.\r\nThe United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development in 2015. We believe that many \r\nof its decisions reflect the global ideas of the late leader \r\nNelson Mandela. They focus primarily on educating \r\nand advancing individuals in order to accept others in \r\nthe spirit of coexistence. Iraq now works in earnest on \r\nincorporating those goals into its governmental scheme.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to note that we, as States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, can realize and sustain \r\npeace while also preventing internal, regional and \r\ninternational conflicts.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Ethiopia.\r\nMr. Amde (Ethiopia): We join the whole world \r\nin paying special tribute to Nelson Mandela — one of \r\nAfrica’s greatest sons, an inspiration to humankind \r\nand a global icon. Today we have an opportunity to \r\ncelebrate the life of Mandela and reflect on his legacy. \r\nIt was a life of endless courage, boundless sacrifice, \r\nmeasureless perseverance and indomitable action. He \r\nfought ceaselessly for the ideals of freedom and justice, \r\nequality, tolerance and reconciliation. Those are the \r\nvery ideals to which the Organization is dedicated and \r\nthat are inscribed in the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nJust 20 years ago, the General Assembly celebrated \r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. During the summit, \r\nPresident Nelson Mandela said at the general debate \r\nthat the challenges of the next half century would be\r\n“whether humanity, and especially those who \r\nwill occupy positions of leadership, will have the \r\ncourage to ensure that at last we build a human \r\nworld consistent with the provisions of that historic \r\nDeclaration and other human rights instruments that \r\nhave been adopted since 1948.” (A/53/PV.7, p.14)\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 79/86\r\nWe do not think we have yet made the significant \r\nprogress that he would have wanted and hoped for.\r\nMandela dedicated his entire life to the cause \r\nof freedom and justice. His struggle to liberate \r\nSouth Africa from apartheid will be remembered for \r\ngenerations to come. He passed through countless trials \r\nand tribulations. It was indeed a long walk to freedom, \r\nbut he still kept the courage to preach tolerance, \r\nforgiveness and reconciliation.\r\nA young Madiba spent time in Ethiopia during the \r\nearly days of his struggle. I am proud to say we provided \r\nhim with some of the support and training he needed \r\nfor his struggle against apartheid and colonialism. He \r\nremembered and said that Ethiopia always held a special \r\nplace in his heart and imagination. And we Ethiopians \r\nhold a special place for him in our hearts too. We revere \r\nhis place in the history of Africa’s freedom, even more \r\nso today. As we undertake considerable reform, we look \r\nto the values and ideals for which he fought. We are \r\nengaging our people with his message of forgiveness \r\nand reconciliation, tolerance and dialogue to sustain \r\nthe peace, stability and development of our country.\r\nWe are not confining our efforts to Ethiopia. We \r\nin the Horn of Africa are living up to our commitment \r\nto silence the guns by 2020 so as to lift the burden of \r\nconflict and war from our children. We are working \r\ntowards making peace a reality for our people. Over \r\nthe past three months, we have launched region-wide \r\nreconciliation and started the process of normalization \r\nbetween and among most of the countries of the Horn of \r\nAfrica. Ethiopia and Eritrea have opened a new chapter \r\nin their relationship, ending two decades of conflict. \r\nThat spirit of reconciliation is also reaching across \r\nSomalia, Djibouti and the Horn of Africa at large. All \r\nof us in the region have played a remarkable role in \r\ncreating peaceful engagement in that regard.\r\nThe African Union Commission Chairperson \r\nrightly called it a clear demonstration of the value and \r\neffectiveness of the search for African solutions to \r\nAfrican problems. I can say with confidence that those \r\nare major developments for the Horn of Africa region. \r\nAs the Secretary-General put it, there is a powerful \r\nwind of hope blowing across the Horn of Africa region. \r\nIt is a wind that offers a start to unravelling years of \r\nconflict and suspicion across a region that has been one \r\nof the most conflict-ridden in Africa. We are extending \r\nthe process to promote a framework for regional \r\nintegration to fight poverty.\r\nThe theme of today’s Nelson Mandela \r\nSummit — “Strengthening the role of the United Nations \r\nin the promotion and maintenance of international \r\npeace: building on Mandela’s legacy” — could not \r\nbe more timely or appropriate. In these difficult \r\ntimes, Madiba’s legacy has real importance and great \r\nsignificance for global peace. The unanimous adoption \r\nof the Nelson Mandela political declaration (resolution \r\n73/1), declaring 2019 as the start of the Nelson Mandela \r\nDecade of Peace, is most welcome. We ourselves are \r\nalready nearly half-way through the Nelson Mandela \r\nDecade for Reconciliation in Africa, declared by the \r\nAfrican Union summit four years ago. Its member \r\nStates have been encouraged to promote truth and \r\nreconciliation as a means to advance democracy and \r\nparticipatory governance and work to secure peace, \r\nstability and development in Africa. However, we \r\nshould do more than just renew our pledge to the \r\nbuilding of a just, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive \r\nand fair world — a world in which Mandela would \r\nhave been proud to participate. To celebrate the life \r\nof this extraordinary man, we should act and follow \r\nhis precept:\r\n“We can change the world and make it a better \r\nplace. It is in our hands to make a difference.”\r\nOur future is indeed in our hands.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the Observer State of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Auza (Holy See): Mandela’s legacy \r\nhas become synonymous with the promotion of \r\npeace and non-violence, reconciliation and healing, \r\nnon-discrimination and the promotion of human rights. \r\nIn a telegram to express his condolences on the death \r\nof Nelson Mandela, Pope Francis paid tribute to his \r\nsteadfast commitment in promoting the human dignity \r\nof citizens from all nations and in forging a new South \r\nAfrica built on the firm foundations of non-violence, \r\nreconciliation and truth. The centenary of Mandela’s \r\nbirth reminds us of another centenary, that of the end \r\nof the First World War — a conflict that violently \r\ndisfigured the face of Europe. Reflecting on the Great \r\nWar and the life of Nelson Mandela, two great lessons \r\nemerge that could serve as golden rules to foster peace.\r\nThe first lesson is that victory never means \r\nhumiliating a defeated foe. Peace is not built by vaunting \r\nthe power of the victor over the vanquished. The haughty \r\nglory of the victor sows a seed of rancor that would \r\nsprout at the first opportunity as vengeance, whereas \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n80/86 18-29599\r\nhumility in victory is a promise of reconciliation. After \r\n27 years of imprisonment, Mandela’s sacrifices were \r\nvindicated with the end of apartheid and his becoming \r\nthe President of South Africa. He was gracious and \r\ngenerous in victory and remained humble before the \r\ncheers of the world. His wisdom led him to reject \r\nrecrimination in favour of reconciliation and to extend \r\na hand of friendship to those who had made him suffer, \r\nfor he was convinced that the future demanded moving \r\nbeyond the past.\r\nThe second lesson is that peace is consolidated \r\nwhen nations can discuss matters on equal terms. \r\nThere is a reason that the League of Nations was born \r\nafter the Great War, and then the United Nations out of \r\nthe dying embers of the Second World War. Effective \r\nmultilateralism is a concrete expression of the family of \r\nnations. As Pope John Paul II affirmed in his address to \r\nthe General Assembly on 5 October 1995,\r\n“The United Nations needs to rise more and \r\nmore above the cold status of an administrative \r\ninstitution and become a moral centre where all \r\nthe nations of the world feel at home and develop \r\na shared awareness of being, as it were, a family of \r\nnations. The idea of ‘family’ immediately evokes \r\nsomething more than simple functional relations or \r\na mere convergence of interests. The family is by \r\nnature a community based on mutual trust, mutual \r\nsupport and sincere respect. In an authentic family \r\nthe strong do not dominate; instead, the weaker \r\nmembers, because of their very weakness, are all \r\nthe more welcomed and served.” (A/50/PV.20, p. 5)\r\nIn Nelson Mandela’s legacy we find that idea in \r\nthe very rich concept of ubuntu, according to which \r\npeople are made people through other people — that \r\nwe are one humankind so bound to one another that we \r\nf lourish only if we help people around us f lourish.\r\nThe political declaration adopted at the beginning \r\nof this Peace Summit (resolution 73/1) acknowledges \r\nthat we must seek the conversion of heart and mind \r\nthat can make a difference. A conversion of hearts is \r\nneeded. The Holy See joins Member States in every \r\neffort to work strenuously for true peace, while \r\nexpressing hope that the daily commitment of us all \r\nwill continue to bear fruit and that there will be an \r\neffective application in international law for the right \r\nto peace as a fundamental human right and a necessary \r\nprerequisite to every other right.\r\nAs Mandela counsels in his autobiography, Long \r\nWalk to Freedom,\r\n“If you want to make peace with your enemy, \r\nyou have to work with your enemy. Then he \r\nbecomes your partner.”\r\nMay Mandela’s inspiring perseverance in seeking \r\njustice, freedom and peace be a motivation for \r\nthis family of nations to redouble our efforts and \r\ndedication in the quest for a more just, and therefore \r\nmore peaceful, world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the Observer State of Palestine.\r\nMs. Abdelhady-Nasser (Palestine): We thank \r\nthe President of the General Assembly and the \r\nrepresentatives of South Africa and Ireland for \r\ntheir laudable efforts to bring us together on this \r\nmomentous occasion.\r\nThe late, honourable President Mandela is widely \r\nquoted as having insightfully stated,\r\n“We know too well that our freedom is \r\nincomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.”\r\nWith those words he further reinforced the unbreakable \r\nbond between those who have suffered oppression \r\nand those who have struggled side-by-side to defeat \r\nit. While imprisoned, Mandela never lost sight of the \r\npath to freedom and remained a messenger of peace \r\nand coexistence. As we honour him, we honour and \r\nuphold the ideals and true justice that he dedicated his \r\nlife to defending, including, as the adopted declaration \r\n(resolution 73/1) reaffirms, the right to the self-\r\ndetermination of peoples who remain under colonial \r\ndomination or foreign occupation.\r\nUpholding those ideals means rejecting domination, \r\noppression, discrimination and injustice, while never \r\ncompromising on the right to freedom, dignity and \r\nequality for all peoples. It means standing together \r\nin solidarity. It means defending multilateralism and \r\nits principal foundation, international law. It means \r\nactively working for peace, not only speaking or \r\ndreaming of peace, but striving daily to rid our world \r\nof conflict and all forms of injustice and inequality.\r\nAs we commemorate Mandela’s centenary and the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights, nothing can justify the fact that \r\nthe Palestinian people continue to be denied their \r\ninalienable rights, even after having endured more \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 81/86\r\nthan seven decades of dispossession, displacement and \r\noppression, and with no end to their suffering in sight. \r\nWe stood alongside many nations that are represented \r\nhere during their long walks to freedom and proudly \r\ncelebrated their independence with them. We still await \r\nthe moment when we can celebrate our freedom.\r\nTransformed by their own experiences of the ills \r\nof oppression, Mandela and his companions could not \r\nabide by any form of injustice. That explains why they \r\nwere and still are among the most vocal in denouncing \r\nIsrael’s colonial occupation and what they themselves \r\ndescribe as the resurgence of apartheid in Palestine. \r\nAhmed Kathrada, who spent 26 years in apartheid \r\njails, dedicated the last years of his life to the freedom \r\nof Palestinian prisoners and the Palestinian people. \r\nThe late Theo-Ben Gurirab of Namibia, who once \r\npresided over the General Assembly, was also among \r\nthe strongest advocates of our just cause, as is the \r\nNobel Peace Prize Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu. \r\nWhile solidarity with the Palestinian people is strong \r\nworldwide, for which we are grateful, it has found in \r\nSouth Africa its ultimate expression.\r\nIn recognition of the deep ties between our struggles, \r\nthe city of Johannesburg offered a statue of Mandela to \r\nthe city of Ramallah. That statue now stands proudly in \r\nthe heart of occupied Palestine, bearing witness to an \r\nanachronistic, illegal and colonial occupation regime, \r\nbut also as an inspiration of what the future might be \r\nonce it ends. Apartheid and colonialism must not be \r\nthe fate of either the Palestinian people or the Israeli \r\npeople. They are man-made disasters that can and must \r\nbe defeated for a just peace to prevail.\r\nHowever, apartheid in South Africa was not \r\ndefeated by mere words. It took the struggle of a nation, \r\nglobal solidarity and measures of accountability against \r\nthat abhorrent regime to bring it to an end. It is time to \r\nresort to similar means to achieve a similar goal — the \r\nfreedom for the Palestinian people, as well as peace \r\nand coexistence for all on the holiest of lands, so that \r\nthere are no oppressors and no oppressed, only brothers \r\nand sisters in humanity. May the spirit of Madiba help \r\nguide us on that path.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor \r\nto the observer of the International Development \r\nLaw Organization.\r\nMr. Civili (International Development Law \r\nOrganization): I am the Permanent Observer of the \r\nInternational Development Law Organization (IDLO) \r\nto the United Nations, and with your permission, Sir, I \r\nwill read out a statement that our Director General was \r\nto deliver last week, before the meeting was suspended.\r\n“Nelson Mandela was born at a time when  \r\ninequality between races and genders was accepted \r\nin both policy and fact, when nations used force \r\nto pursue their agendas and the gap between the \r\nrich and the poor seemed too big to overcome. \r\nUnfortunately, our world today is not that different. \r\nYes, apartheid is dead, but many of the other \r\nthings that Mandela fought against are still alive \r\ntoday and in some cases thriving — entrenched \r\npoverty, growing inequalities, violent conflicts, \r\nwidespread violence against women and girls, \r\nrising authoritarianism, intolerance and the \r\nerosion of human rights. There can be no peace \r\nwithout justice.\r\n“Our Director General was one of many \r\namong the crowds in London in 2005 when Nelson \r\nMandela said,\r\n ‘[O]vercoming poverty is not a gesture of  \r\ncharity. It is an act of justice. It is the protection of \r\na fundamental human right, the right to dignity and \r\na decent life.’\r\n“We know this only too well at the International \r\nDevelopment Law Organization, the world’s only \r\nintergovernmental organization that is exclusively \r\ndevoted to advancing the contribution of the rule \r\nof law to development. For 30 years we have been \r\nworking in some of the poorest and most fragile parts \r\nof the world to reform laws, strengthen institutions \r\nand empower people to access justice and claim their \r\nrights. The rule of law is not an abstract concept but \r\nrather the means by which peaceful and inclusive \r\nsocieties can be built. It gives a widow the rights to \r\nthe land that she has farmed for decades. It enables \r\na community to resolve its disputes in a courtroom \r\nrather than on the battlefield. It empowers the poor \r\nto hold the powerful to account. Access to justice \r\nand the rule of law are integral elements of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. They \r\nare also fundamental to preventing conflicts and \r\nsustaining peace.\r\n“IDLO welcomes the political declaration \r\nadopted at this Summit (resolution 73/1). We note \r\nin particular the call to move beyond words. The \r\nbiggest threat to peace is a failure of leadership — the \r\nfailure to stand up against intolerance, the erosion \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n82/86 18-29599\r\nof human rights and attacks on the rule of law at the \r\nnational and international level. Mandela’s legacy \r\nis one of courageous leadership. If I may recall his \r\nwords again, ‘Recognize that the world is hungry \r\nfor action, not words. Act with courage and vision’. \r\nLet us all act with courage and vision.”\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the International Institute for Democracy \r\nand Electoral Assistance.\r\nMr. Tommasoli (International Institute for \r\nDemocracy and Electoral Assistance): It is an honour \r\nfor me to celebrate the legacy of a great man of peace \r\nand a democratic leader whose wisdom and compassion \r\ncontinue to inspire democracy advocates, human rights \r\ndefenders and peacebuilders around the world. His life \r\nand legacy are particularly important to the mission \r\nand work of the International Institute for Democracy \r\nand Electoral Assistance, which has proudly counted \r\nSouth Africa among its founding members since our \r\nestablishment in 1995, one year after the end of apartheid \r\nand the first democratic elections in South Africa.\r\nWe are humbled by the opportunity to recall \r\nMadiba’s two key messages that continue to guide our \r\naction to this day. The first is that dialogue as a means \r\nto achieve democracy, peace and development is at the \r\ncore of his legacy. Even at the darkest time of his fight \r\nagainst apartheid, and especially during the challenging \r\nperiod of transition towards a democratic South Africa, \r\nhe underscored the importance of dialogue and the \r\nneed to look holistically at the mutually sustaining \r\ngoals of democracy, peace and development, which are \r\nenshrined in the South African Constitution.\r\nThe second message is that freedom and \r\ndemocracy are values that we should always defend, \r\nirrespective of the consequences. Many delegations \r\nhave quoted Mandela the statesman and Nobel Peace \r\nlaureate. I would like to quote him when he was facing \r\ntrial. In 1964, when he was about to be sentenced to \r\nimprisonment, he said,\r\n“During my lifetime I have dedicated myself \r\nto this struggle of the African people. I have fought \r\nagainst white domination, and I have fought against \r\nblack domination. I have cherished the ideal of a \r\ndemocratic and free society in which all persons \r\nwill live together in harmony and with equal \r\nopportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live \r\nfor. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am \r\nprepared to die.”\r\nWe join the many voices that have today echoed the \r\nvalues that Mandela so valiantly promoted and that are \r\nat the core of the ideals of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.\r\nMs. Torsney (Inter-Parliamentary Union): “If you \r\nwant to make peace with your enemy, you have to work \r\nwith your enemy. Then he becomes your partner.” That \r\nmemorable quote of Nelson Mandela is a clear example \r\nof his wisdom and illustrates the value of his legacy. We \r\nare all different. Each of us has a particular point of view \r\nand concrete proposals to address the challenges that \r\nour world is facing today. But staying entrenched in our \r\npositions will not contribute to long-term sustainable \r\nsolutions. Working together, as partners, and putting \r\naside our differences is the only way to move forward. \r\nThat is what the United Nations does, by promoting \r\ntolerance and peaceful coexistence.\r\nThat is also what we do at the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion (IPU), the global organization of national \r\nparliaments. We foster dialogue, build bridges between \r\npeople and promote peace and understanding among \r\nparliamentarians from around the world and from \r\nall political factions. The IPU and its 178 member \r\nparliaments welcome this Peace Summit in honour \r\nof Nelson Mandela. The world needs more leaders \r\nwho are guided by ideals of equality, understanding \r\nand compassion, like Madiba. In a few weeks, at our \r\n139th Assembly, in Geneva, the IPU will celebrate the \r\ncentenary of Mr. Mandela’s birth and the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. The global parliamentary community will pay \r\ntribute to the legacy of Madiba and will recommit to the \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Declaration.\r\nThe human race is on a course towards self-\r\ndestruction. Its drivers are many, but they can be \r\nsummed up in a few points — a global competition for \r\nresources and new markets, a senseless arms race and \r\nrising inequality and economic insecurity around the \r\nworld. As a result, people are growing angry and see \r\nenemies where friends should be found. Governments \r\nthat reflect that anger are increasingly being elected, \r\nand they are searching for opportunities to win what \r\nthey perceive to be a zero-sum game. In the process, \r\nthey exploit racism, xenophobia and other fears in order \r\nto fuel even more anger and division among people.\r\nLet us take a minute to think about that. Globally, \r\nwe are producing and consuming more than nature \r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 83/86\r\ncan generate. Our economic model is tilted towards \r\ngrowth as an end in itself and does not value human \r\nwell-being, which, at the end of the day, is all that \r\nreally matters. Can we sleep soundly when we know \r\nthat we are contributing to the inexorable and tragic end \r\nof humanity? We have a responsibility as individuals. \r\nOur actions have a concrete impact on other people and \r\non nature. We also have a collective responsibility as \r\ncommunities and nations. Our first responsibility is \r\nto work resolutely towards attaining the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, as they represent our best option for \r\nachieving environmental sustainability and social and \r\neconomic justice. Importantly, we need to recognize the \r\nvalue of democracy and human rights as the bedrock of \r\npeace. Democracy empowers people and provides them \r\nwith a way to work through their differences and find \r\nsolutions to their problems, whatever they are.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nInspired by Nelson Mandela’s legacy, let us all work \r\ntogether, Governments and parliaments, as partners for \r\npeace in a sustainable world.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nf loor to the observer of the South Centre.\r\nMr. Montes (South Centre): I am honoured to \r\nread out the South Centre’s statement for the Nelson \r\nMandela Peace Summit on behalf of my director, \r\nMr. Carlos Correa.\r\n“The South Centre is greatly pleased to join \r\nthe international community and the people of \r\nSouth Africa in this historic Nelson Mandela Peace \r\nSummit. This is a memorable event in the year of \r\ncelebrations of the centenary of the birth of the \r\nfounding father of the South African nation, a giant \r\nof humankind.\r\n“Our remarks are centred on Mandela’s \r\ncontribution to social development as he battled \r\nthe unjust system of apartheid. They also refer \r\nto one of the many examples of his capacity to \r\nlisten to and address the problems of the people, \r\nparticularly the poor. Mr. Mandela’s fight against \r\noppression and poverty and for social justice is \r\nan example to us all. His legacy remains a strong \r\nsource of inspiration for all people. He taught us \r\nto be strong in our beliefs and committed to our \r\ncause, to respect, to forgive and to make peace. He \r\nwas an icon in the fight for freedom, social justice \r\nand a dignified life, to which all human beings \r\nare entitled despite the fact that because of greed \r\nand hunger, many are still condemned to a life of \r\nsuffering and poverty.\r\n“South Africa’s progress in social development \r\nsince the end of apartheid is clear. Apartheid was \r\nthe main obstacle to that development. It was the \r\nsystem that normalized and enforced discrimination \r\nagainst non-white South Africans in education, \r\nhealth, decent work, income-earning assets and \r\na dignified life. The legal system condemned \r\nnon-whites to a life of poverty and vulnerability. \r\nLeading the African National Congress, Mandela \r\noverturned that system to ensure that all South \r\nAfricans would be treated equally under the law \r\nand that all forms of discrimination were ended. \r\nThe fact that in September 2015 the United Nations \r\ncommunity was able to arrive at an agreement on \r\ntransforming our world (resolution 70/1) would \r\nhave been impossible to imagine if apartheid had \r\nstill reigned in South Africa.\r\n“I now turn to the example of Mandela’s \r\nsensitivity to the suffering of the people, \r\nespecially the poor. In an interview in April 2001, \r\nMandela, then a private citizen after serving \r\nas South Africa’s President, spoke forthrightly \r\nagainst the 39 multinational companies that had \r\ntaken the Government to court over its decision \r\nto use f lexibilities allowed under World Trade \r\nOrganization rules to foster access to medicines to \r\nfight the HIV/AIDS epidemic. At that time, official \r\nfigures showed that one in nine South Africans was \r\ninfected with HIV or already had AIDS, and only \r\na tiny minority of those 4.7 million people could \r\nafford appropriate drugs. As a court respondent, \r\nMandela said,\r\n‘I think the pharmaceuticals are exploiting \r\nthe situation that exists in countries like South \r\nAfrica, in the developing world, because they \r\ncharge exorbitant prices which are beyond the \r\ncapacity of the ordinary HIV/AIDS person. That \r\nis completely wrong and must be condemned.’\r\n“Mandela joined his voice with those who \r\nclaimed that the Government’s action was necessary \r\nand fully legitimate:\r\n‘The Government is perfectly entitled, in \r\nfacing that situation, to resort to generic drugs, \r\nand it is a gross error for the companies, for \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n84/86 18-29599\r\nthe pharmaceuticals, to take the Government \r\nto court.’\r\n“Mr. Mandela’s intervention contributed to the \r\nmounting pressure on multinational pharmaceutical \r\nfirms to abide by the internationally agreed \r\npatent rules and abandon their attempts to further \r\nexpand patent rights in the developing world. \r\nHis intervention represented a strong ethical call \r\nto subordinate commercial interests to the right \r\nto health.\r\n“As the think tank of developing countries \r\nworking on multilateral affairs, we are indebted to \r\nNelson Mandela. He was a strong supporter of the \r\nSouth Centre. In his address at the opening session \r\nof the South Centre’s Council of Representatives in \r\n1998 in New York, he said,\r\n‘As the premier source of research on \r\nissues affecting the South, and growing \r\nout of the work and experience of the South \r\nCommission, the Centre plays a role whose \r\nvalue for the developing world cannot be \r\nunderestimated.’\r\n“In recognizing the work and value of the \r\nSouth Centre as a research institution of the South, \r\nhe also paid a tribute to another great son of Africa, \r\nhis good friend the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, \r\nthe founding father of the South Commission, \r\nwhich led to the establishment of the South Centre, \r\nthe intergovernmental organization of developing \r\ncountries. The work and legacy of two of the greatest \r\nsons of Africa remain the driving forces in our daily \r\nwork to support the efforts of developing countries \r\nto reach inclusive and sustainable development.”\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give \r\nthe f loor to the observer of the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation.\r\nMr. Awawdeh (Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation) (spoke in Arabic): It is an honour for me \r\nto be in this Hall today to commemorate a true hero of \r\nour times. There can be no doubt that Nelson Mandela \r\nleft a great legacy that demonstrates the importance \r\nof peaceful struggle, of patience and of modesty in \r\nvictory, while promoting reconciliation among South \r\nAfricans. His ideas, his fight and his victories constitute \r\na collective legacy that we are proud of.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nthe General Assembly for convening this high-\r\nlevel meeting on global peace to mark the hundredth \r\nanniversary of the birth of Nelson Mandela. We are \r\nalso immensely grateful to South Africa and Ireland for \r\ntheir efforts in organizing this event, which represents \r\na source of inspiration that will light our path in the \r\ndays to come as we seek to sustain peace throughout \r\nthe world. The experience of Nelson Mandela and \r\nhis struggle are models to follow in terms of national \r\nreconciliation and democracy-building. Addressing \r\nisolation through integration, exclusion through \r\nengagement and discrimination through coexistence \r\nwill ultimately result in a strong and cohesive society \r\nbased on citizenship and diversity, capable of bringing \r\na nation to the highest levels of progress, development, \r\nsecurity and prosperity. That is the model that we hope \r\nto see in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and other Member States.\r\nThe Palestinian question remains the main cause \r\nfor our organization. We fully support the legitimate \r\nright of the Palestinian people to be free from \r\noccupation and achieve independence while living in \r\npeace and dignity on their own land. The Palestinian \r\npeople have lived for seven decades under continuous \r\nrepression, deprived of their basic human rights. If we \r\ntruly believe in Nelson Mandela’s vision and ideals, we \r\nshould commit to peace and to settling the Palestinian \r\nquestion on fair foundations in accordance with United \r\nNations resolutions. Mandela has a famous saying: \r\n“[O]ur freedom is incomplete without the freedom of \r\nthe Palestinians”.\r\nWe should align our thoughts and values with \r\nthose of Nelson Mandela in our collective quest to \r\nachieve peace. We must not only talk about the apartheid \r\nthat Nelson Mandela rose up against. We must also talk \r\nabout the racist wall of separation built by Israel to \r\nseparate Palestinians from Israeli settlements built on \r\noccupied Palestinian land. We must achieve peace and \r\njustice for the Palestinian people and for the peoples of \r\nYemen, Iraq, Libya, Syria and Kashmir and others such \r\nas the Rohingya minority in Myanmar.\r\nThe absolute truth is that racial discrimination \r\nstill exists everywhere on the planet. We must \r\ntherefore sincerely commit today to honouring all of \r\nthe commitments we have made and to addressing \r\noppression and tyranny, as well as supporting the \r\noppressed and the victims while standing by them. \r\nThe only way to express our appreciation and respect \r\nfor Nelson Mandela is by safeguarding his legacy and \r\ntaking it further.\r\n24/09/2018 A/73/PV.5\r\n18-29599 85/86\r\nThe President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nf loor to the observer of the International Organization \r\nof la Francophonie.\r\nMs. Herdt (International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie) (spoke in French): I have the honour \r\nof delivering the message of Ms. Michaëlle Jean, \r\nSecretary-General of the International Organization of \r\nla Francophonie.\r\n“It is with great respect that I welcome the \r\nholding of the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit \r\nand the platform it offers us today to rebuild the \r\nvalues at the heart of our work. We speak with one \r\nvoice — Nelson Mandela’s legacy compels us to. \r\nThis Summit carries with it a deep emotion that \r\ngalvanizes us and reminds us of the evidence of \r\nour common humanity and our shared destiny. \r\nTo be free is not only being able to throw off our \r\nchains, it is being able to live in a way that respects \r\nand strengthens the freedom of others. Nelson \r\nMandela, a man of peace and wisdom, kindness and \r\nforgiveness, taught us the unconditional respect \r\nthat we owe to each and every human being.\r\n“His powerful legacy relentlessly compels us to \r\nmeet our dual responsibilities. First, we are called \r\non to meet our individual responsibilities, because \r\nit is above all through the daily exercise of will \r\nand courage that we can all contribute to building \r\na world marked by mutual respect, tolerance and \r\nunderstanding in our relationships. And after that, \r\nwe must also meet our collective responsibilities, \r\nthrough the official missions entrusted to us that \r\ntask us with safeguarding the general interest and \r\nensuring full respect for the equal dignity of all.\r\n“La Francophonie stands ready to fully \r\nassume its rightful place. I would like to assure \r\nthe Assembly that we are up to the task of acting \r\nwith the essential courage that the people demand \r\nof us. As the political declaration (resolution 73/1) \r\nsolemnly adopted at the opening of this Summit \r\nreminds us, it is up to us to take responsibility as \r\nwe address the Assembly, and as the leaders of \r\nour organizations, we must work to break down \r\nresistance and do everything we can to tackle \r\nthose who would cast doubt on the primacy of \r\nmultilateralism. That was behind the conclusions of \r\nthe high-level interactive dialogue with the heads \r\nof international and regional organizations held \r\nin June at the initiative of the Secretary-General, \r\nto which we actively contributed. The Assembly \r\ncan count on La Francophonie’s commitment not \r\nonly to promoting but above all to realizing the \r\nmultilateralism that we have called for, both in \r\nnetworking and in action, based on improving the \r\ncomplementarity and coordination of our efforts.\r\n“The entire francophone world is committed \r\nto participating in these struggles. “Living \r\ntogether in solidarity, sharing humanistic values \r\nand respecting diversity: a source of peace and \r\nprosperity in the francophone area” will be the \r\ntheme of the seventeenth Summit of Heads of \r\nState and Government of la Francophonie when \r\nour politicians and diplomats meet in Yerevan, \r\nArmenia, on 11 and 12 October.\r\n“That is also the meaning behind the tools and \r\nmechanisms that we continue to develop in the \r\nservice of peace. The International Organization of \r\nla Francophonie has never ceased to support those \r\nof its members in difficulties, in our understanding \r\nthat democracy, peace and development are \r\ninseparable. In both the French-speaking world and \r\nthe world in general, our objective is to encourage \r\nrenewed mobilization to prevent and settle crises \r\nand conflicts peacefully, to enshrine fundamental \r\nrights and the fight against inequality and identify \r\ninnovative measures in a continually challenging \r\ninternational context. La Francophonie continues \r\nto oppose the notion of cultural relativism, because \r\nwhat defines us — beyond the diversity of our \r\ncultures, languages and characteristics of our \r\ncivilizations — is shared universal values. The \r\nLibres Ensemble initiative, an expression of the \r\nhope and determination of francophone youth in \r\nresponse to movements of hatred and the rejection \r\nof others, also magnificently echoes the teachings \r\nof Nelson Mandela.\r\n“At a time of retreat into nationalism, dialogue \r\nand solidarity are essential. The Fez Summit \r\nConference on dialogue between cultures and \r\nreligions, held a few days ago in Morocco, was \r\nsimilarly aimed at promoting new relationships \r\nbased on the renewal of a culture of peace and \r\ncoexistence by questioning our diversity and \r\nour otherness.\r\n“At a time when we are striving to achieve the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, when \r\nwe have at last realized that prevention and the \r\nA/73/PV.5 24/09/2018\r\n86/86 18-29599\r\npatient and meticulous building of lasting peace \r\nshould be our greatest priority — but also at a time \r\nwhen our humanity is being questioned by the \r\ndisgrace and horror that are destroying the lives \r\nof tens of millions of men, women and children, \r\nand when the very survival of future generations in \r\nthe face of climate change is in our hands — will \r\nwe be capable of living up to the legacy of Nelson \r\nMandela, a man who never ceased to believe, \r\ndespite the immensity of the trials he faced, that \r\n‘love comes more naturally to the human heart \r\nthan its opposite’? We are infinitely grateful to him \r\nfor his legacy, and we owe it to ourselves never to \r\nbetray him.”\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now give the \r\nf loor to the Director of the Liaison Office of the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\r\nMrs. Mucavi (Food and Agriculture Organization \r\nof the United Nations): Freeing the world from hunger \r\nand want is a fundamental contribution to lasting peace. \r\nThose words are part of the Constitution of the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \r\n(FAO) and were introduced by our founders in 1945 \r\nwhen it was created immediately after the end of the \r\nSecond World War.\r\nNelson Mandela’s historic centenary once again \r\nobliges us to recognize that promoting human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms such as the right to food and \r\nto economic and social development is key to achieving \r\ninclusive and peaceful societies, as set forth in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nRegrettably, the The State of Food Security and \r\nNutrition in the World 2018 report shows that 821 million \r\npeople are suffering from hunger and malnutrition \r\ntoday. The increase in that number during the past \r\nyear is due to two main reasons, conflicts and climate \r\nchange. The evidence is clear — where conflicts arise, \r\nhunger increases. There is a direct relationship between \r\nthem, and the impact of wars and conflict on hunger \r\nand malnutrition is even worse when one considers that \r\nglobal military spending continues to increase while \r\nthe resources that countries can allocate to eradicating \r\nhunger and poverty are scarce and sometimes \r\ndecreasing. According to the Global Report on Food \r\nCrises 2018, 60 per cent of the people who experienced \r\nacute hunger in 2017 were in conflict areas. Earlier \r\nthis year, with its unanimous adoption of resolution \r\n2417 (2018), the Security Council drew attention to \r\nthe link between armed conflicts and conflict-induced \r\nfood insecurity and the threat of famine. The FAO has \r\ncontributed to that important step by generating the \r\nevidence through the Integrated Food Security Phase \r\nClassification, the Global Report on Food Crises and \r\nthe regular FAO-World Food Programme briefings to \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe FAO is strongly committed to promoting food \r\nsecurity and peace. In 2016, for instance, together with \r\nseveral Nobel Peace Prize laureates, we established \r\nthe FAO-Nobel Peace Laureates Alliance for Food \r\nSecurity and Peace to tackle the twin problems of \r\nhunger and violence. Last week, we were pleased to \r\nadmit Ms. Graça Machel to honorary membership of \r\nthe Alliance as a tribute to Mandela’s work for freedom \r\nand peace. As Madiba said,\r\n“Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not \r\nnatural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and \r\neradicated by the actions of human beings. And \r\novercoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is \r\nan act of justice.”\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker for this meeting.\r\nWe have thus concluded the Nelson Mandela Peace \r\nSummit. The participation of more than 150 speakers \r\nand the adoption of a powerful political declaration \r\n(resolution 73/1) attests to the commitment of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to the principles that guided the life \r\nand transformative action of Madiba. At this Summit \r\nwe have affirmed our commitment to multilateralism \r\nfor addressing global threats and challenges. I invite \r\none and all to be inspired in their daily work by the \r\nideals that inspired this great leader, such as peace, \r\ndevelopment, disarmament and the defence of \r\nfundamental rights.\r\nThe Nelson Mandela Peace Summit is \r\nnow concluded.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 66.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
