"United Nations A/73/PV.6\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n6th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 25 September 2018, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9 a.m.\r\nTribute to the memory of His Excellency \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, seventh Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): Before we \r\nproceed to consider the item on our agenda for this \r\nmorning, I would like to invite members to stand and \r\nobserve a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, who passed away on \r\n18 August 2018.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a \r\nminute of silence.\r\nAgenda item 112\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/73/1)\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance \r\nwith the decision taken at its 3rd plenary meeting, on \r\n21 September 2018, the General Assembly will hear \r\na presentation by the Secretary-General of his annual \r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/73/1), under \r\nagenda item 112.\r\nI give the f loor to the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: Our world is suffering \r\nfrom a bad case of trust deficit disorder. People \r\nare feeling troubled and insecure, and trust is at a \r\nbreaking point — trust in national institutions, trust \r\namong States and trust in the rules-based global order. \r\nWithin countries, people are losing faith in political \r\nestablishments, polarization is on the rise and populism \r\nis on the march. Among countries, cooperation is less \r\ncertain and more difficult, and the divisions in the \r\nSecurity Council are stark. Trust in global governance \r\nis also fragile, as twenty-first-century challenges \r\noutpace twentieth-century institutions and mindsets.\r\nWe have never had a true system of global \r\ngovernance, much less a fully democratic one. Still, over \r\nmany decades, we have established solid foundations \r\nfor international cooperation. We came together as the \r\nUnited Nations to build institutions, norms and rules \r\nto advance our shared interests. We have raised the \r\nstandards of living of millions. We have forged peace \r\nin troubled lands and, indeed, we have avoided a third \r\nworld war. But none of that can be taken for granted.\r\nToday, the world order is increasingly chaotic. \r\nPower relations are less clear and universal values are \r\nbeing eroded. Democratic principles are under siege \r\nand the rule of law is being undermined. Impunity is \r\non the rise, as leaders and States push the boundaries \r\nboth at home and in the international arena. We face \r\na set of paradoxes. The world is more connected, yet \r\nsocieties are becoming more fragmented. Challenges \r\nare growing outward, while many people are turning \r\ninward. And multilateralism is under fire precisely \r\nwhen we need it most.\r\nIt is true that we are moving in the direction of a \r\nmultipolar world, but multipolarity will not in itself \r\nguarantee peace or solve global problems. A century \r\nago, Europe was multipolar. The balance of power \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

It \r\nwas not. Without strong multilateral frameworks for \r\nEurope-wide cooperation and problem-solving, the \r\nresult was a grievous world war. Today, with shifts \r\nin the balance of power, the risk of confrontation \r\nmay increase.\r\nIn assessing the Peloponnesian War in ancient \r\nGreece, Thucydides said, “It was the rise of Athens \r\nand the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made \r\nwar inevitable.” That is what the political scientist \r\nGraham Allison calls the “Thucydides trap”. But in \r\nhis book Destined for War, reviewing many examples \r\nof rivalry in the past, he concluded that conflict is \r\nnever inevitable. Indeed, with leadership committed \r\nto strategic cooperation and to managing competing \r\ninterests, we can avoid war and steer the world onto a \r\nsafer path.\r\nIndividual leaders have the duty to advance the \r\nwell-being of their people, but it runs deeper. Together, \r\nas guardians of the common good, we also have a duty \r\nto promote and support a reformed, reinvigorated and \r\nstrengthened multilateral system. We need commitment \r\nto a rules-based order, with the United Nations at its \r\ncentre and with the various institutions and treaties that \r\nbring the Charter of the United Nations to life. We need \r\nto show the added value of international cooperation by \r\ndelivering peace, defending human rights and driving \r\neconomic and social progress for women and men \r\neverywhere. That is why I am so committed to reform, \r\nand to making the United Nations more effective in \r\nresponding to the needs and aspirations of “We the \r\npeoples”. In the face of massive existential threats to \r\npeople and the planet, but equally at a time of compelling \r\nopportunities for shared prosperity, there is no way \r\nforward but through collective, common-sense action \r\nfor the common good. That is how we can rebuild trust.\r\nIn my address last year (see A/72/PV.3), I highlighted \r\nseven challenges. One year later, they remain sadly \r\nunresolved. There is outrage at our inability to end the \r\nwars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere. The Rohingya \r\npeople remain exiled and traumatized in misery, still \r\nyearning for safety and justice. Palestinians and Israelis \r\nare still locked in endless conflict, with a two-State \r\nsolution ever more distant. The threat of terror looms, \r\nfed by the root causes of radicalization and violent \r\nextremism, and terrorism is ever more interlinked \r\nwith international organized crime and the trafficking \r\nof people, drugs and arms, and with corruption. The \r\nnuclear peril has not eased, with non-proliferation at \r\nserious risk. Nuclear-weapon States are modernizing \r\ntheir arsenals. A new arms race could be triggered and \r\nthe threshold for their use lowered. We have seen the \r\noutrageous use of chemical weapons with full impunity, \r\ndespite their ban. Protections against dangerous \r\nbiological weapons are weak.\r\nInequality is undermining faith in the social \r\ncontract and is a clear obstacle to the achievement of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals. Tensions over \r\ntrade are on the rise. Migrants and refugees continue \r\nto face discrimination and demagoguery in the context \r\nof clearly insufficient international cooperation. And \r\nas we mark the seventieth anniversary of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, the human rights agenda \r\nis losing ground and authoritarianism is on the rise. \r\nAs the politics of pessimism spreads, we must guard \r\nagainst self-fulfilling prophecies. Those who see their \r\nneighbours as dangerous might create a threat where \r\nthere was none. Those who close their borders to regular \r\nmigration only fuel the work of traffickers, and those \r\nwho ignore human rights in combating terrorism tend \r\nto breed the very extremism that they are trying to end.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nWe have an obligation to change this course and \r\ntackle the challenges facing us. We must act based \r\non facts, not out of fear, and we must rely on reason, \r\nnot delusions. Our work must focus on prevention. \r\nThis session of the General Assembly presents us \r\nwith a unique opportunity to move forward. To give \r\njust one example, I want to welcome the firm support \r\nthat has been shown for my Action for Peacekeeping \r\ninitiative, which has been endorsed by 148 States and \r\norganizations. Its goal is to help our missions succeed \r\nin unstable and long-term situations. Today, however, \r\nI want to focus on two major challenges that over the \r\npast year have become exceedingly urgent — climate \r\nchange and new risks related to advances in technology. \r\nLet me discuss each of them in turn.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nLet us first consider something that constitutes a \r\ndirect threat to our existence — climate change. We are \r\nat a pivotal moment. If we do not change course in the \r\nnext two years, we risk losing control of the situation. \r\nClimate change is occurring at a faster pace than we \r\ncan keep up with and is provoking loud calls for help all \r\nover the world. According to the World Meteorological \r\nOrganization, the past two decades have included 18 of \r\nthe warmest years since such data began to be recorded, \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 3/53\r\nin 1850. A few weeks ago, the ultra-thick and reputedly \r\nultra-solid Greenland ice sheet in the northern part \r\nof the country began to crack for the first time. The \r\nconcentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is \r\nat its highest level in 3 million years, and it is only \r\nincreasing. What is worse is that, as world leaders, \r\nour actions have not been up to the challenge. We \r\nmust listen to our eminent world scientists. We must \r\nface reality head-on, and we must be more ambitious \r\nand do more to show that we take the urgency of the \r\nsituation seriously. We must ensure the implementation \r\nof the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which has \r\nimmense potential for putting us on the right track but \r\nwhose goals are far from being achieved, although they \r\nrepresent only the bare minimum required to avoid the \r\nworst fallout from climate change.\r\nI am concerned about the fact that the recent Bangkok \r\nclimate talks on guidelines for the implementation \r\nof the Agreement were concluded without making \r\nsufficient progress. The next Conference of the Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change, to be held in Poland in December, \r\nwill be decisive. It is absolutely crucial to ensure that it \r\nsucceeds. As I said recently, the disagreements among \r\nMember States that paralysed us in Copenhagen cannot \r\nbe repeated in Katowice. Fortunately, the evolution of \r\ntechnology is our ally. Green energy is more competitive \r\nthan ever. If we commit to the right path, climate action \r\ncould produce an additional $26 billion for the global \r\neconomy from now until 2030. Green-economy policies \r\ncould create 24 million jobs. More and more businesses \r\nand investors are finding that the green economy is \r\nprofitable. Far from threatening the foundations of the \r\neconomy, climate action creates new industries, new \r\nmarkets and additional jobs, while reducing reliance \r\non fossil fuels. It is inaction, not action, that puts the \r\neconomy in danger.\r\nGovernments must demonstrate wisdom and \r\ncourage. That means ending multi-billion-dollar \r\nsubsidies for fossil fuels, putting a fair price on carbon \r\nemissions and ending investments in unsustainable \r\ninfrastructure that will perpetuate harmful practices for \r\ndecades to come. Our future is at stake. Climate change \r\nspares nothing and can shake the entire world. If we are \r\nto ensure global prosperity and the security of nations, \r\nit is essential to maintain global warming well below \r\n2°C. That is why in September 2019 I will convene a \r\nclimate change summit to rally efforts and stimulate \r\nfunding. It will provide an opportunity to bring together \r\nStates, cities and actors in the real economy, along with \r\nthe decision-makers, businesses, financial community \r\nand representatives of civil society, to focus on the \r\nheart of the problem. The summit will be held one year \r\nbefore the review of every State’s commitments under \r\nthe Paris Agreement, and those commitments will have \r\nto be taken further. We need to be more ambitious than \r\never, and leaders and partners will have the opportunity \r\nto demonstrate that ambition at the summit. For that to \r\nbe possible, we must act today. The world needs all of \r\nus to be champions of climate action.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLet me now turn to new technologies and to what \r\nwe can do to uphold their promise while keeping \r\ntheir perils at bay. And there is indeed great promise. \r\nScientific progress has helped cure deadly diseases, \r\nfeed growing populations, drive economic growth and \r\nconnect businesses, communities, families and friends \r\nacross the world. Rapidly developing fields such as \r\nartificial intelligence, blockchain technology and \r\nbiotechnology have the potential to turbocharge progress \r\ntowards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nArtificial intelligence is connecting people across \r\nlanguages and supporting doctors in making better \r\ndiagnoses. Driverless vehicles will revolutionize \r\ntransportation. But there are also risks and serious \r\ndangers. Technological advances may disrupt labour \r\nmarkets as traditional jobs change or disappear, even \r\nas the number of young job-seekers continues to grow. \r\nRetraining will be needed at previously unimaginable \r\nlevels. Education must adapt from the earliest grades. \r\nThe very nature of work will change. Governments may \r\nhave to consider stronger safety nets and eventually \r\nuniversal basic income.\r\nAt the same time, technology is being misused \r\nby terrorists and for sexual exploitation and \r\nabuse. Organized criminal networks lurk on the \r\ndark web, profiting from encryption and near-\r\nanonymous cryptocurrency payments to traffic in \r\npeople and illegal goods. Some reports estimate \r\nthat cybercrime is now putting $1.5 trillion in the \r\npockets of cybercriminals annually. Malicious acts in \r\ncyberspace — such as disinformation campaigns — are \r\npolarizing communities and diminishing trust among \r\nStates. And more and more people are getting their \r\ninformation from news or social media feeds that echo \r\ntheir views, reinforce tribalism and assure people that \r\nthey are right and the other side is wrong.\r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n4/53 18-29769\r\nThe digital revolution is also being used to \r\ndiscriminate against women and reinforce our \r\nmale-dominated culture. Indeed, there is a deep gender \r\ngap in access to digital technologies, widening the \r\ndigital divide. We must dismantle obstacles and create \r\nopportunities for women, ensure equality and change \r\nonline and toxic corporate cultures. The technology \r\nsector must open up and become more diverse — not \r\nleast for its own benefit.\r\nWith technology outpacing institutions, cooperation \r\nbetween countries and among stakeholders will be \r\ncrucial, including Member States, the private sector, \r\nresearch centres, civil society and academia. There \r\nare many mutually beneficial solutions to digital \r\nchallenges. We urgently need to find a way to apply \r\nthem. At the United Nations, we are harnessing \r\ntechnologies in support of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. We are creating innovation labs, including in my \r\nOffice. And in July, I established a High-Level Panel on \r\nDigital Cooperation, which met yesterday and which is \r\na dialogue platform for all key actors.\r\nThe impacts of new technologies on warfare are a \r\ndirect threat to our common responsibility to guarantee \r\npeace and security. The weaponization of artificial \r\nintelligence is a growing concern. The prospect of \r\nweapons that can select and attack a target on their \r\nown raises multiple alarms and could trigger new \r\narms races. The diminished oversight of weapons has \r\nimplications for our efforts to contain threats, prevent \r\nescalation and adhere to international humanitarian \r\nlaw and human rights law. Let us call it as it is. The \r\nprospect of machines with the discretion and power to \r\ntake human life is morally repugnant. Heaven forbid, a \r\nnew war could very well include a massive cyberattack \r\nthat targets not only military capacities, but also critical \r\ncivilian infrastructure.\r\nI am encouraged by the 10 possible guiding \r\nprinciples elaborated in Geneva last month by the \r\nGroup of Governmental Experts on lethal autonomous \r\nweapons systems. More work on those issues, aimed \r\nat building trust between and within nations, will be \r\nneeded if we are to ensure the responsible use of new \r\ntechnologies. I urge you to use the United Nations as \r\na platform to draw global attention to such crucial \r\nmatters and to nurture a digital future that is safe and \r\nbeneficial for all.\r\nDespite the chaos and confusion in our world, I \r\nalso see winds of hope blowing around the globe. Just \r\ndays ago, I witnessed the signing of a historic peace \r\nagreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea in Saudi \r\nArabia. Soon after, the Presidents of Djibouti and \r\nEritrea met in Jeddah to launch a peace process. Eritrea \r\nand Somalia have established diplomatic relations. And \r\nin the same region, in the context of a summit of the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, the two \r\nrival leaders in South Sudan finally signed a peace \r\nagreement. I am hopeful that those efforts will continue \r\nto be consolidated so that the people of the Horn of \r\nAfrica can finally turn the page on war and conflict.\r\nThe courageous initiative of the Singapore summit \r\nbetween the leaders of the United States and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, along with the \r\nrecent meeting of the two Korean leaders in Pyongyang, \r\noffers hope for the possibility of a full and verifiable \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula in a context \r\nof regional security.\r\nDuring my recent visit to Colombia, I was impressed \r\nby the people’s strong commitment to peace, now \r\nreaffirmed by President Duque Márquez. In Central \r\nAsia, I personally witnessed strengthened cooperation \r\namong States after Uzbekistan went through a peaceful \r\npolitical transition. Greece and the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia have taken a major step towards \r\nresolving their differences. Our peacekeeping mission \r\nin Liberia ended a decade and a half of work this year \r\nfollowing the country’s first peaceful democratic \r\ntransition, adding to peacekeeping successes elsewhere \r\nin West Africa. The approval of a compact on refugees \r\nand another on migration represents a sign of hope, \r\neven if there is still a long way to go to reconcile full \r\nrespect for the rights of people on the move with the \r\nlegitimate interests of States.\r\nHundreds of millions of people have been lifted \r\nout of extreme poverty across the world over the past \r\nthree decades, and we averted looming famine in \r\nfour countries that had been impacted in the past two \r\nyears. Armenia’s young people were at the heart of \r\nthat country’s peaceful political transition earlier this \r\nyear — showing the potential of youth to use their \r\nvoice to advance democracy. And the drive for gender \r\nequality is gaining ground, amid a growing awareness \r\nof pervasive discrimination against women and girls, \r\nfrom violence, harassment and exploitation to unequal \r\npay and exclusion from decision-making. The United \r\nNations must lead the way in pursuit of gender equality. \r\nFor the first time in United Nations history, there is full \r\ngender parity in our Senior Management Group and \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 5/53\r\namong Resident Coordinators leading country teams \r\naround the world. We are firmly committed to equality \r\nand empowerment everywhere.\r\nAs our late Secretary-General Kofi Annan once \r\nreminded us:\r\n“We share a common destiny. We can master it \r\nonly if we face it together. And that, my friends, is \r\nwhy we have the United Nations.” (see SG/SM/7262)\r\nOur future rests on solidarity. We must repair \r\nbroken trust. We must reinvigorate our multilateral \r\nproject. And we must uphold dignity for one and all.\r\nAgenda item 8\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): It is a genuine \r\nhonour for me to welcome everyone to the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session. I welcome \r\neveryone to the only place where a meeting of this kind \r\nis possible. Only the General Assembly, as the main \r\ndeliberative and representative body of the United \r\nNations, offers to all of the peoples and leaders of \r\nthe world the opportunity to hear and be heard on an \r\nequal footing.\r\nThe contribution made by the United Nations \r\nto humankind has been immense. International law, \r\nthe promotion of peace, human rights, protection \r\nstandards for the environment, the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and those pre-eminent principles \r\nthat govern international coexistence were born in the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe reality is that the work of the United Nations is \r\nas relevant today as it was 73 years ago. Multilateralism \r\nis the only viable response to the global problems that \r\nwe face. To undermine multilateralism or to cast doubt \r\nupon its merits will only lead to instability and division, \r\nto mistrust and polarization. Around the world, millions \r\nof people are suffering from violence, war and want, and \r\nfrom the effects of climate change. For those millions \r\nof human beings, uncertainty and fear are their daily \r\nlot. Inequality has deprived many societies of hope and \r\nopportunity. Those crushed dreams and that lack of any \r\nhope for the future is being exploited by some to further \r\ndivide our communities, stirring up racism, xenophobia \r\nand violence, which represent the very antithesis of the \r\npurpose of the Charter that we adopted in 1945.\r\nNo one can be indifferent to human suffering. \r\nWars and conflicts, as well as economic crises and \r\nenvironmental degradation, affect us all without \r\ndistinction. We live in an interconnected world, which \r\nobliges us to sustain global dialogue and a multilateral \r\nresponse. That is why I have proposed that we return \r\nto the multilateral agenda with a renewed commitment \r\nbased on three principles: global leadership, shared \r\nresponsibilities and collective action.\r\nGlobal leadership is necessary in order to \r\nidentify common solutions to global problems and \r\ntake appropriate and timely decisions. We need \r\nshared responsibility because we all have a common \r\ncommitment to ensure social cohesion and human \r\ndignity, as well as the health of the planet. Collective \r\naction is needed because the most sensitive issues of \r\nhumankind are of concern to all of us.\r\nI invite the members of the Assembly to find \r\ninspiration in the Andean principle of minga, which \r\nrefers to working together and sharing duties for the \r\nbenefit of the community. Let us create a global minga \r\nto build societies that are more peaceful, egalitarian, \r\nsustainable and resilient.\r\nThis year I call on those present to work together \r\naround seven priorities.\r\nFirst, we need to attend to gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women, which remain a debt we owe \r\nto more than half the population, and our failure to do so \r\nslows global development. Achieving the economic and \r\nproductive inclusion of women could add an additional \r\n11 per cent to the world’s gross domestic product by \r\n2025. Unfortunately, violence against women persists in \r\nall regions of the world. Girls and adolescents still lack \r\nsufficient access to information and quality education \r\nto reduce inequalities.\r\nSecond, we must focus on the implementation of \r\nthe new global compacts on migration and refugees, \r\nwhich will benefit the nearly 260 million migrants and \r\nthe nearly 25 million refugees who have been displaced \r\nby conflict and violence.\r\nThird, we need to create decent work opportunities \r\nfor all. This represents one of the most important \r\nchallenges for public policies and the development and \r\nsustainability of social security systems.\r\nFourth, we must work to give greater attention to \r\nenvironmental protection and progress on agreements \r\nto curb climate change, as well as the implementation \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n6/53 18-29769\r\nof the Paris Agreement. Extreme heat waves, forest \r\nfires, storms and f loods are leaving behind a trail of \r\ndeath and devastation. In August, the state of Kerala \r\nin India suffered its worst monsoon f looding in \r\nrecent history, which killed 400 people and displaced \r\n1 million more from their homes. Hurricanes killed \r\nthousands of people in 2017, making them the cause \r\nof some of the deadliest extreme-weather disasters \r\nin history. We have a responsibility to stop, as soon \r\nas possible, the policies and habits of production and \r\nconsumption that are destroying our planet. I have \r\nproposed to highlight the problem of plastic pollution \r\nas a widespread environmental hazard that affects the \r\nhealth and well-being of people around the world. The \r\nGreat Pacific Garbage Patch is more than four times \r\nthe size of Germany, or three times the size of France, \r\nand represents a latent threat to the Pacific coasts of the \r\nUnited States.\r\nFifth, it is important to strengthen the political and \r\nsocial commitment to people with disabilities. Greater \r\nawareness of the specific needs of that population is still \r\nneeded. Accessibility, inclusive and quality education, \r\nand decent jobs are challenges faced by the largest \r\nminority of humankind, that is, people with disabilities.\r\nSixth, we must revitalize the United Nations. We \r\nwill focus on three areas: implementing system reforms; \r\nstrengthening the revitalization process of the General \r\nAssembly in order to optimize its working methods and \r\nenhance its deliberative and decision-making role; and \r\ncontinuing the reform process of the Security Council, \r\nin keeping with the will and commitment of States.\r\nSeventh, peace and security and the role of young \r\npeople in conflict prevention deserve due attention. The \r\nAssembly must become the principal peacebuilding \r\norgan through a preventive approach. Sustainable \r\npeace must be rooted in dialogue and understanding, \r\nand facilitating that dialogue will be my priority. The \r\nGeneral Assembly must promote efforts to ensure \r\ngreater opportunities for and political participation \r\nby young people in order to prevent conditions from \r\narising that inexorably lead them to violent extremism.\r\nPeace and security constitute one of the central axes \r\nof the work of the Organization. The most acute conflicts \r\nand disputes must be resolved through dialogue, \r\nrapprochement, generosity and mutual understanding, \r\neven where there are religious and cultural differences. \r\nIn recent months, some of those present have taken \r\nsignificant steps towards understanding and peace, \r\nwhich encourages us and merits our recognition.\r\nIn July, the President of Eritrea and the Prime \r\nMinister of Ethiopia signed a Joint Declaration of Peace \r\nand Friendship to end decades of conflict between the \r\ntwo countries. The state of war there has come to an \r\nend, and there has been a resumption of diplomatic \r\nrelations, transport, trade and communications.\r\nRecently, we saw the adoption of the Panmunjom \r\nDeclaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of \r\nthe Korean Peninsula between the Republic of Korea \r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Both \r\nnations agreed to work together to end decades of war \r\nand conflict. That represents a historic milestone for a \r\nnew era of peace and the denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula. Both events give us hope in a world where \r\nmany conflicts still await a peaceful solution.\r\nThe challenges faced by the Charter of the United \r\nNations have evolved. The threats of climate change, \r\nthe erosion of biodiversity, human trafficking, \r\nenvironmental pollution, large movements of both \r\nmigrants and refugees, terrorism and ethnic conflicts \r\nhave risen to the top of our agenda. We have entered \r\na technological and digital era that fosters economic, \r\nsocial and cultural exchanges that were unimaginable \r\na few decades ago — challenges that the Organization \r\nwill have to make itself better prepared to face.\r\nThat is why we must make progress in implementing \r\nthe reforms to the United Nations system. We want \r\na more effective and responsive Organization that \r\nreflects the political and economic realities of a \r\nchanging world. The leadership and commitment of \r\nStates and the Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nAntónio Guterres, are encouraging for decisive \r\nprogress in those reforms. We must maintain our vision \r\nand commitment to implement the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, as that is the only way of \r\nensuring that all people can live in dignity and peace.\r\nI invite all present to devote particular attention to \r\nthe vulnerabilities of countries in special situations and \r\nthe efforts needed for them to fulfil their Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. For example, the small island \r\nStates, landlocked countries and the least developed \r\nnations require our shared responsibility to achieve \r\nthose Goals.\r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 7/53\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI reaffirm my commitment to Africa and its \r\npeoples. Let us dedicate our best efforts to accelerating \r\nthe implementation of Africa’s development agenda. \r\nLet us not only talk about Africa, but let us also act \r\nwith Africa.\r\nOne of the outstanding challenges of the \r\nOrganization is to achieve a definitive and lasting peace \r\nin the Middle East, in line with the implementation of \r\nthe resolutions adopted by the Assembly.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThis year, we commemorate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. The fight for human rights remains a challenge \r\nin the world.\r\nSeventy years ago, a great woman, Mrs. Eleanor \r\nRoosevelt,  led the work of the Human Rights Commission \r\nin charge of drafting the Universal Declaration. One of \r\nher statements illustrates, in a simple way, why we must \r\nwork to bring this Organization and its decisions closer \r\nto our peoples. Mrs. Roosevelt asked:\r\n“Where, after all, do universal human rights \r\nbegin? In small places, close to home — so close \r\nand so small that they cannot be seen on any of the \r\nmaps of the world. Yet they are the world of the \r\nindividual person; the neighbourhood he lives in; \r\nthe school or college he attends; the factory, farm \r\nor office where he works.\r\n“Such are the places where every man, woman \r\nand child seeks equal justice, equal opportunity, \r\nequal dignity without discrimination. Unless these \r\nrights have meaning there, they have little meaning \r\nanywhere. Without concerted citizen action to \r\nuphold them close to home, we shall look in vain \r\nfor progress in the larger world.”\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nI wish to inaugurate the seventy-third session of \r\nthe General Assembly with an effusive appeal to the \r\nworld’s leaders to live up to the needs of our peoples and \r\nnot to falter in their attempts to build a more peaceful, \r\nsafer and more humane world order, where each person \r\ncan find their place with dignity. Let us build, then, a \r\nUnited Nations that is more relevant to all people.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to the first speaker for this \r\nmorning, I would like to remind members that the list \r\nof speakers for the general debate has been established \r\non the agreed basis that statements should be no longer \r\nthan 15 minutes so as to enable all the speakers to be \r\nheard at a given meeting.\r\nI would like to appeal to speakers to deliver their \r\nstatements at a reasonable pace within this time frame, \r\nso that interpretation into the other official United \r\nNations languages may be provided properly.\r\nI would also like to draw attention to the decision \r\ntaken by the General Assembly at previous sessions, \r\nnamely, that the practice of expressing congratulations \r\ninside the General Assembly Hall after a speech has \r\nbeen delivered is strongly discouraged.\r\nIn that connection, after delivering their statements, \r\nspeakers are invited to exit the General Assembly Hall \r\nthrough room GA-200, located behind the rostrum, \r\nbefore returning to their seats.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nproceed in the same manner during the general debate \r\nof the seventy-third session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Finally, I should like to draw the \r\nattention of members to the fact that during the general \r\ndebate official photographs of all the speakers are taken \r\nby the Department of Public Information. Members \r\ninterested in obtaining such photographs are requested \r\nto contact the Photo Library of the United Nations.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Michel Temer, \r\nPresident of the Federative Republic of Brazil\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil.\r\nMr. Michel Temer, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Michel Temer, \r\nPresident of the Federative Republic of Brazil, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Temer (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is an \r\nhonour for Brazil and it gives us great pleasure to \r\nofficially open this general debate.\r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n8/53 18-29769\r\nI am pleased to greet the President of the General \r\nAssembly, María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, the first \r\nLatin American woman to hold that high office at the \r\nUnited Nations. Allow me to reiterate, Madam, my \r\nwishes for your every success, and rest assured that you \r\ncan count on Brazil.\r\nIt is also particularly satisfying to greet Secretary-\r\nGeneral António Guterres in our common language.\r\nHow many speakers have already come to this \r\nrostrum to call for the improvement of the international \r\norder that we have been building for decades? There \r\nhave certainly been many, myself included. I believe we \r\nwere and still are right to do so, and the words we spoke \r\nremain relevant.\r\nHowever, if we truly want to improve our \r\ninternational collective order, yet another task is \r\nrequired of us today: to defend the very integrity of \r\nthat order. However imperfect it may be, the current \r\norder has nevertheless served the greater interests \r\nof humankind.\r\nThere are numerous challenges to the integrity \r\nof the current international order. We live in times \r\nclouded by isolationist forces. Old intolerances are \r\nre-emerging. Unilateral relapses are increasingly \r\nbecoming less the exception than the rule. Yet those \r\nchallenges should not and cannot intimidate us. When \r\nit comes to isolationism, intolerance and unilateralism, \r\nwe must respond to each of those tendencies with the \r\nvery best that our peoples have.\r\nBrazil has been responding to the first of those \r\ntendencies — isolationism — with more openness \r\nand more integration. Brazil is keenly aware that our \r\ncommon development ultimately depends on more \r\ninternational trade and investment f lows. It depends \r\non increased contact with new ideas and with new \r\ntechnologies. We will build prosperity that can be \r\neffectively shared only by opening ourselves to \r\nothers, rather than by withdrawing into introspection \r\nand isolation.\r\nThat is how Brazil has acted. We have implemented \r\na universalist foreign policy. We have worked to deepen \r\nintegration mechanisms in our geographic region. \r\nWithin the South American Common Market, for \r\nexample, we have reaffirmed the group’s democratic \r\ncalling, brought trade barriers down and entered into \r\nnew agreements. We have been pushing for strengthened \r\nties with the countries forming the Pacific Alliance so \r\nas to seek an increasingly united Latin America, as \r\nenshrined in our Constitution.\r\nWe have also revitalized and initiated trade \r\nnegotiations with partners in all regions, such as the \r\nEuropean Union, the European Free Trade Association, \r\nCanada, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Lebanon, \r\nMorocco and Tunisia. Through these and other \r\ninitiatives, we continue to strengthen our relationships \r\nwith the Americas as a whole, as well as with Europe, \r\nAsia and Africa.\r\nBrazil’s participation in cooperation forums, \r\nsuch as the G-20, the BRICS group of Brazil, Russia, \r\nIndia, China and South Africa, and the Community \r\nof Portuguese-speaking Countries, has been \r\nespecially productive. In those forums we have worked \r\nto produce tangible results that have a direct impact \r\non the daily life of our societies. It is with openness \r\nand integration that we approach a better future for \r\nall. Isolation may provide a false sense of security. \r\nProtectionism may sound seductive. But it is with \r\nopenness and integration that we achieve harmony, \r\ngrowth and progress.\r\nTurning to the challenge posed by intolerance, \r\nBrazil has responded decisively with dialogue and \r\nsolidarity, which inspire us, at every moment, to \r\nhonour the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\nThe implementation of that document, created almost \r\n70 years ago, is an imperative that requires permanent \r\nattention and action. Much has already been done for \r\nthe sake of human rights by Governments, institutions \r\nand individuals. One such remarkable individual was \r\nSérgio Vieira de Mello, a Brazilian national to whom \r\nI wish to pay tribute as we remember the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of his tragic death.\r\nWe must nonetheless acknowledge that violations \r\nof international norms protecting individuals and their \r\ndignity persist worldwide. In Latin America, Brazil has \r\nbeen working to uphold democracy and human rights. \r\nWe will continue to do so with so many other countries \r\nin solidarity with brotherly peoples that have suffered \r\nso much.\r\nDialogue and solidarity also form the basis for the \r\nrecently agreed global compact for safe, orderly and \r\nregular migration. There are more than 250 million \r\nmigrants in the world. These are men, women and \r\nchildren who, threatened by protracted crises, are \r\nfaced with the hard and risky choice of leaving their \r\nhomelands. It is our duty to protect them, and that is \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 9/53\r\nthe very purpose of the global compact on migration. \r\nIt now falls on us to conclude the negotiations on the \r\nglobal compact on refugees.\r\nIn South America, a large-scale migratory wave \r\nis under way. It is estimated that more than 1 million \r\nVenezuelans have left their country in search of better \r\nliving conditions. Brazil has welcomed all those who \r\nhave arrived in our territory. We have sought to provide \r\nassistance of all types to tens of thousands of migrants. \r\nIn cooperation with the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, we have built shelters \r\nto protect them as best as we can. We have sought to \r\nrelocate them throughout the country. We have issued \r\ndocuments that enable them to work in Brazil. We have \r\noffered schooling for the children, and vaccination and \r\nhealth services for all. But we know that this crisis \r\ncan be resolved only when our neighbour, Venezuela, \r\nrediscovers the path of development.\r\nBrazil has a proud tradition of welcoming \r\nforeigners. As a people, we have been forged through \r\ndiversity. There is a piece of the world in every \r\nBrazilian. Faithful to that tradition, last year we passed \r\na new migration law — a modern piece of legislation \r\nthat not only protects the immigrant’s dignity but also \r\nrecognizes the benefits of immigration. We in Brazil \r\nhave expanded rights and have streamlined the entry \r\nand residence process.\r\nDialogue and solidarity are antidotes to intolerance, \r\nand they are the foundation for a lasting peace. That \r\nhas been the cornerstone of the Brazilian position \r\nregarding the various crises in the Middle East. As it \r\njoins the celebrations of the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe creation of Israel, Brazil renews its support for the \r\ntwo-State solution — Israel and Palestine living side by \r\nside in peace and security.\r\nWe also support international efforts to bring the \r\nconflict in Syria to a long overdue end. We have sought \r\nto help alleviate the great suffering there. In 2017 alone, \r\nfor example, Brazil donated approximately one ton of \r\nmedicines and vaccines for children affected by the \r\nconflict. We have also welcomed a considerable number \r\nof Syrian refugees.\r\nOn the Korean peninsula, dialogue and solidarity \r\nrepresent the cornerstone of our position. We reiterate \r\nour support for diplomatic solutions leading to \r\ndenuclearization and peace.\r\nIt is through dialogue and solidarity that we will \r\novercome intolerance and build peace. As expressed by \r\nNelson Mandela, whose centenary we commemorate \r\nthis year, it is our duty to strive towards “a world of \r\ntolerance and respect for difference”, and to show an \r\nunwavering “commitment to peaceful solutions of \r\nconflicts and disputes”.\r\nLastly, the challenge of unilateralism must be met \r\nwith more diplomacy and more multilateralism. We do \r\nso firmly convinced that collective problems demand \r\ncoordinated solutions. That is noblest meaning of the \r\nUnited Nations — a house for mutual understanding.\r\nWe must strengthen the Organization. We must \r\nmake it more legitimate and effective. We need important \r\nreforms — among them the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, whose current configuration reflects a world \r\nthat no longer exists. Finally, we must reinvigorate \r\nthe values of diplomacy and multilateralism. We have \r\nshown time and again what we are capable of together \r\nwhen those values guide our actions, such as when we \r\ntook a historic step last year in concluding the Treaty on \r\nthe Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. I had the honour of \r\nbeing the first Head of State to sign it.\r\nThat is also how, over the course of decades, we \r\nbuilt a robust multilateral trade system with increasingly \r\ncomprehensive rules and a credible and effective \r\ndispute-settlement mechanism. Those are shared historic \r\nachievements, which we must honour and broaden by \r\neliminating the many distortions in agricultural trade, \r\nwhich primarily affect developing countries.\r\nDiplomacy and multilateralism provide us with \r\neffective solutions well beyond disarmament, nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and international trade. The same \r\nis true in many other areas, such as sustainable \r\ndevelopment, which is crucial for the future \r\nof humankind.\r\nI note that in recent years alone, we adopted the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris \r\nAgreement. Those are true milestones that put us on the \r\npath of economic development with social justice and \r\nrespect for the environment. Brazil’s early commitment \r\nto sustainable development remains unwavering. There \r\nis no shortage of examples.\r\nWe are fully committed to the shift towards a \r\nlow-carbon international economy. Over 40 per cent \r\nof Brazil’s energy portfolio is clean and renewable. It \r\nis one of the most sustainable in the world. We have \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n10/53 18-29769\r\nalso stepped up efforts to reduce deforestation. Long-\r\nterm trends are encouraging. Today, in the Brazilian \r\nAmazon region, deforestation rates are 75 per cent \r\nlower than in 2004. Over the past two years, we have \r\ncreated and expanded environmental protection areas \r\nin Brazil, which are now more than four times the size \r\nof Norway.\r\nThe protection of the oceans is another cause that \r\nis dear to us. During the World Water Forum, which \r\nwe hosted in Brasilia earlier this year, we established \r\nprotected areas in Brazilian waters as vast as Germany \r\nand France combined. In two years, we have doubled \r\nthe size of protected areas in Brazil.\r\nDiplomacy and multilateralism are also decisive \r\ninstruments for global security, as demonstrated by \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions, in which Brazil \r\nis proud to play a major role. And make no mistake, \r\nthey are also decisive instruments for defeating \r\nterrorism and fighting transnational crime. Trafficking \r\nin persons, arms and drugs, money laundering, and \r\nsexual exploitation are crimes that know no borders. \r\nThey are scourges that corrode our societies and can \r\nbe effectively tackled only through concerted policies \r\nand actions.\r\nThat is what we have done in our region. In Brasilia, \r\nwe hosted the first ministerial meeting of South \r\nAmerican countries on border security. Since then, we \r\nhave stepped up cooperation with our neighbours in \r\ncombating transnational crime. We must remain united \r\nin the collective task of building a world where peace, \r\ndevelopment and human rights prevail. Absolutely \r\nnothing will be achieved alone. We will achieve nothing \r\nwithout diplomacy and multilateralism.\r\nThis is the last time that I will have the privilege \r\nof representing my country in the general debate at the \r\nGeneral Assembly as the President of the Republic. \r\nIn two weeks, the Brazilian people will go to the \r\npolls. They will choose their political leaders in both \r\nthe executive and the legislative branches, who will \r\ngovern Brazil starting in 2019, as enshrined in our \r\nConstitution. That is what has been done for almost 30 \r\nyear, and that is how it must always be. After all, we \r\nare Government officials chosen by the people because \r\nall power comes from the people, and the President \r\nholds the power only for a fixed period. The transfer \r\nof power is the very essence of democracy. Ours is a \r\nvibrant democracy anchored by solid institutions. As \r\nI turn over the presidency to my successor, I will have \r\nthe peace of mind of having fulfilled my duties.\r\nToday, in Brazil, we can look back and realize \r\nhow much we have accomplished in such a short term \r\nof office. We rejected populism, and we overcame the \r\nworst recession in our history, with severe consequences \r\nfor society, especially for the poor. We managed public \r\nfinances responsibly and restored our economic \r\ncredibility. We are growing and creating jobs again. \r\nSocial programmes once threatened by uncontrolled \r\nspending have been rescued and expanded. We put \r\nBrazil back on the path of development.\r\nThe country that I will hand over to whomever \r\nthe Brazilian people elect will be better than the one \r\nI received. Much remains to be done, but we are back \r\non track. It is time to move ahead. The incoming \r\nAdministration and National Congress will find a solid \r\nfoundation upon which a more prosperous and just \r\ncountry can continue to be built.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly know that \r\nBrazil will always be a steady ally for cooperation \r\namong nations. In the face of isolationism, Brazil \r\nresponds with more openness and integration. In the \r\nface of intolerance, it responds with increased dialogue \r\nand solidarity. And, in the face of unilateralism, it \r\nresponds with more diplomacy and multilateralism.\r\nIn the words of the late Kofi Annan:\r\n“Our mission is to confront ignorance with \r\nknowledge, bigotry with tolerance, and isolation \r\nwith the outstretched hand of generosity”.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Michel Temer, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Lenin Moreno Garcés, \r\nConstitutional President of the Republic of Ecuador\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Constitutional President \r\nof the Republic of Ecuador.\r\nMr. Lenin Moreno Garcés, Constitutional President \r\nof the Republic of Ecuador, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 11/53\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Lenin Moreno \r\nGarcés, Constitutional President of the Republic of \r\nEcuador, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Moreno Garcés (spoke in Spanish): \r\nEverything in life is cause and effect, and every effect \r\nhas a cause. Human beings tend to look to the past to \r\nfind similarities in order to predict the future, because \r\nwe are, inescapably and permanently, governed by \r\ncause and effect.\r\nWe, the rulers, leaders and decision-makers, have \r\nan immense responsibility to alter the way in which the \r\nworld perceives its future. Our peoples must understand \r\nthat causality is not inevitability. On the contrary, \r\npeople have the ability to change their circumstances. \r\nIn order for them to do so, the international policies that \r\nare shaped here, in the most important of the world’s \r\nforums, must help us to empower our societies and to \r\nconceive of history as something that we can change. \r\nPolicies are successful when they seek to resolve \r\neveryone’s personal stories, especially those of the \r\npoorest, neediest and most disenfranchised — because \r\nwe are nations united to change the history of peoples.\r\nOur Government plan is called A Whole Life, \r\nbecause that is who we are and what we do. At the end \r\nof the day, we have a whole life to be right and wrong, \r\nto dream, to build and to love. It is up to us to analyse \r\nand manage the consequences. The plan is called A \r\nWhole Life because we want to attend to human beings \r\nfrom the moment of conception to the moment that \r\nGod decides to close their eyes — to their departure. \r\nDepending on where each person is in his or her life \r\ncycle, our attention could involve care, inspiration, \r\nencouragement, support or gratitude.\r\nCare and inspiration are more appropriate for the \r\nfirst stage. Caring for mothers and children, before and \r\nafter birth, and looking after that child during its first \r\n1,000 days of life is a mission of warmth.\r\nThen comes the stage of inspiring those little \r\nones to enjoy themselves, to play, to study and to be \r\nhappy. We must teach them to love science and to be \r\npassionate about technology. It is important to study, but \r\nit is perhaps more constructive and enlightening to be \r\ncreative, to love research, to indulge one’s imagination, \r\nto explore the challenges of technology, to continuously \r\ncultivate one’s values and to never stop playing and \r\nexperimenting with colours, sounds, smells, textures, \r\nf lavours and knowledge.\r\nAfter that comes encouragement, aimed at offering \r\nyoung people knowledge that will serve them in the \r\nfuture, in their professional career, and at encouraging \r\nthem to be enterprising and to hold themselves in high \r\nesteem. We must make their future more transparent \r\nand less complicated. We must help them learn to love \r\nlife and to discover the beauty of their environment, \r\nso that they are never forced to seek satisfaction or \r\nsecurity in foreign substances. We must encourage \r\nthem with praise, with greater participation and with \r\nconfidence in their abilities and their dreams.\r\nSupport is for the adult, perhaps. We support adults \r\nin their efforts to get jobs, build families and succeed in \r\ntheir endeavours aimed at ensuring social and personal \r\nsecurity and, above all, to put a roof over their heads. \r\nWe have called that mission A House for All.\r\nFinally comes gratitude, which seeks to enable \r\nour elders to live out their lives knowing that their \r\nsociety appreciates what they have done. Let them live \r\nsurrounded by love, company and care, so that those \r\nyears can be their best.\r\nSomeone once asked me how these proposals were \r\nborn, and I answered with several maybes. Maybe it \r\nis because I was born and spent my childhood in the \r\nheart of the Amazon, the lung of the world, in the most \r\ndiverse tropical rainforest on the planet. There I became \r\nfamiliar with the deep problems of an abandoned region. \r\nI could see how precarious health and life was without \r\nminimum coverage for human beings. Many children \r\ndied, and many mothers perished with them.\r\nWithin the framework of the General Assembly, \r\ntwo fundamental health issues will be addressed at the \r\nhighest level — tuberculosis and non-transmissible \r\ndiseases. It is my hope and Ecuador’s commitment, \r\nabove all, that those discussions will lead to agreements \r\nfor and commitments to concrete action. It is scandalous, \r\nunjust and immoral that access to life-saving medicines \r\nis often limited because intellectual property and \r\nthe profits of the big pharmaceutical companies are \r\nfavoured over a universal right to health. It is that \r\nkind of discussion that enables the United Nations to \r\nhave meaning in the daily lives of the world’s citizens. \r\nThe more we strive to enable our United Nations to \r\ntouch people’s lives, the more we will strengthen the \r\nOrganization for the future.\r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n12/53 18-29769\r\nMaybe it is because, after several years of playing \r\nin my neighbourhood, surrounded by supportive \r\nneighbours, I learned the value of community life. We \r\nwould visit people’s homes, the neighbours took care \r\nof us, we helped one other in all circumstances and we \r\ncelebrated our achievements in community. In fact, the \r\nideal of shared peace and life was also the genesis of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe cannot forget that this must be the heart of the \r\ndiscussion of the large and small problems existing \r\namong countries, and that, within the framework of \r\nthat discussion, we must call for ongoing dialogue, \r\nas mentioned by President Temer, for reciprocity as \r\nan institution, for strengthening multilateralism, for \r\nlistening to one another in dialogue, but above all, for \r\nlistening to those who live in situations that we wish to \r\nanalyse, address and solve.\r\nMaybe it is because when I was young, I and other \r\ncolleagues had excellent ideas, but lacked both the \r\nknowledge and the capacity to carry out our hopes. We \r\ntherefore had to live through the anguish of not having \r\nstart-up capital for our businesses, and we suffered \r\nlong nights when monthly payments were due, while \r\nalso struggling to pay our workers. We learned at first \r\nhand not to allow ourselves to be undervalued for \r\nbeing young. We learned the decisive role of private \r\nenterprise. We understood that entrepreneurship is a \r\nvalue that generates production, wealth, employment, \r\nwell-being, self-esteem and freedom.\r\nToday, the private sector in the global arena \r\nis more aware of its role — extending far beyond \r\nprofit, production and employment. Today, large, \r\nmedium-sized and small enterprises have thousands of \r\ncommunicating vessels, which, by understanding their \r\npurpose, which is to ensure well-being in their daily \r\nactions, can be key actors for global action to promote \r\npeace and prosperity. In that connection, we must \r\ntogether keep the commitments we have undertaken, \r\nsuch as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich promotes partnership as a core element.\r\nMaybe it is because 20 years ago, I was assaulted \r\nand lost the use of my legs. As those present can see, \r\nI am wheelchair-bound. Is that bad? I do not know. \r\nChinese wisdom says that things are neither so bad, \r\nnor so good. It was bad because returning home from \r\nthe hospital was hard; there were no more intravenous \r\ntubes or painkillers, but rather a constant and persistent \r\npain. I was reminded of Francis of Assisi, who spoke \r\nof the pain of another, because I found that there are \r\nother, and perhaps even greater, pains. It was also good \r\nbecause now, from my wheelchair, I see at the height \r\nof the heart. When people have legs, they see straight \r\nand upwards. Whereas from a wheelchair, we see \r\nhorizontally and downwards, and as such, we discover \r\nother realities and worlds. We see those who encounter \r\nobstacles impeding them in their efforts to move \r\nforward, to continue, and even to live — obstacles of \r\nvarying types: mistreatment, xenophobia, racism, \r\ninjustice, machismo and inequity, in other words, \r\nexclusion. That story is not just my story; it is the story \r\nof 1 billion people around the world.\r\nI welcome the fact that one of the main topics to be \r\naddressed is the implementation of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. \r\nThe implementation of that Convention and its Optional \r\nProtocol is the best guarantee that, together, we will \r\nfulfil a pending commitment. In that regard, Ecuador \r\nis honoured to hold the presidency of the Conference of \r\nStates Parties to the Convention for the next two years.\r\nFrom that position, we will contribute to the \r\npromotion and protection of the rights of persons \r\nwith disabilities, as well as step up efforts already in \r\nmotion to achieve greater accessibility, with a view to \r\nenabling the United Nations to become truly inclusive. \r\nWe are not only talking about physical accessibility, \r\nbut also about having people with disabilities and their \r\nrights be considered in all United Nations discussions, \r\nresolutions and initiatives.\r\nMaybe because now, just as in the past, as I travel \r\naround my country and the world, I see exclusion and \r\ninjustice. We exclude the different, the poor, the elderly, \r\nthe young. We mistreat women, girls and indigenous \r\npeople. There are so many abandoned and forgotten \r\nbrothers and sisters. Many people simply pass by, without \r\neven noticing their presence. As States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations we cannot allow indolence and idleness, \r\nmisery and injustice to continue to be part of the daily \r\nlandscape. That is what the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals draw attention to. They are a fundamental part \r\nof the programme that my Government has proposed to \r\nthe Ecuadorian people, which we have called, and I will \r\nrepeat, A Whole Life.\r\nMaybe because it is evident to me that we want to \r\nbe happy throughout life, and that is why we govern. \r\nWe are here in a great country. The Declaration of \r\nIndependence of the United States of America, written \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 13/53\r\nby Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and Benjamin \r\nFranklin, states in its famous second sentence,\r\n“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that \r\nall men are created equal, that they are endowed \r\nby their creator with certain unalienable rights, \r\nthat among these are life, liberty and the pursuit \r\nof happiness”.\r\nWhat a phrase “the pursuit of happiness” is. That \r\nsentence inspired, inter alia, the Constitution of this \r\ngreat country — a reference for the world that inspires \r\nscientific research and development.\r\nFor that reason, and maybe because we always \r\nfollow world events closely, we do not understand \r\nhow a country like this one can blockade an almost \r\ndefenceless people such as Cuba. It is impossible for \r\nus to understand blockades against others, including \r\npossibly their rights to life, freedom and the pursuit \r\nof happiness.\r\nMaybe because we were young idealists and we \r\ncontinue to be dissatisfied adults, we do not understand \r\nhow the great Powers can spend their resources on \r\nweapons, instead of investing in the development of \r\npeoples. For that reason, perhaps, we do not understand \r\nhow those countries that have achieved development \r\nand superiority in armaments and have also felt the \r\npain of war through their own children can intervene \r\nin other people’s conflicts, not with a view to helping \r\nto resolve them, but to the contrary, to aggravate, and \r\neven perpetuate, them.\r\nMaybe because when unscrupulous bankers \r\nraided the pockets of Ecuadorians, we saw families \r\nand children left helpless and turn to migration. When \r\nGovernments deviate from their objective of caring for \r\nthe poorest and the most vulnerable, those people seek \r\nbetter opportunities outside of and far from their own \r\nland. No one abandons their beloved land voluntarily.\r\nIn Ecuador, we receive an inflow of at least 6,000 \r\nVenezuelan brothers and sisters daily. The children \r\narrive with measles, diphtheria and polio, and pregnant \r\nwomen arrive never having had a check-up. We have \r\nearmarked more than 50,000 vaccines for those \r\nbeautiful and defenceless children, and we have carried \r\nout tens of thousands of health check-ups on the more \r\nthan 1 million brothers and sisters who have left their \r\nhomes in search of better luck in the largest diaspora in \r\nthe history of our continent.\r\nWe have urged the Venezuelan Government and \r\npeople to resolve their crisis, as they should, through \r\na candid and inclusive national dialogue. We recently \r\ninvited the brother countries of the region to practice \r\nsolidarity, in a practical and integrated manner, with the \r\nVenezuelan migrants, displaced persons and refugees. \r\nWe do not want our countries to be left standing alone \r\nmerely with diplomatic statements. We want continent-\r\nwide action to find a structural solution to the problems \r\nof our fraternal people of Venezuela. I reiterate that no \r\none migrates of their own volition. They do so because \r\nthey are forced to be uprooted and to painfully distance \r\nthemselves from their families and emotions.\r\nJosé Martí said that when a people emigrates, \r\ntheir rulers are the leftovers. There are plenty who \r\nprolong their stay in power and become dark, sinister \r\nGovernments with corrupt mafias. And just as we are \r\nin solidarity with those who come to us, we also invite \r\nour own long-departed to return to their place of birth \r\nand reintegrate into the big family that is their country.\r\nThe global compact for safe, orderly and regular \r\nmigration was adopted by Ecuador in July and will be \r\nadopted at the global level in December in Morocco. \r\nWe cannot let that compact become a dead letter. We \r\nmust keep in mind that inclusion has no borders, and \r\nthat the rights of others to life and happiness do not end \r\nwhere mine begin. Both rights are an inherent part of \r\nhuman beings. They are interdependent and enriched \r\nby being interwoven through cohabitation.\r\nWith regard to the Venezuelan crisis — or that \r\nwhich Nicaragua is experiencing — our Latin America \r\nhas the great challenge of strengthening its democracy \r\nafter various countries have endured authoritarian, \r\ncorrupt and populist Governments. The history of the \r\nUnited Nations is the history of a common pact for \r\nthe preservation of the human rights of the citizens of \r\nthe world.\r\nRights can be guaranteed only within the \r\nframework of solid institutions, with ample freedom \r\nof expression and transitions of power, which are the \r\nfundamental elements of solid democracies and must \r\nbe the commitment of our nations in order to build \r\nthose democracies, care for them and treasure them. \r\nMy Government maintains its democratic commitment \r\nand, in each of its actions and decisions, preserves its \r\ncommitment to the original ideals of our United Nations.\r\nThe late Kofi Annan, a great man who left so many \r\nimportant lessons, said that, in the face of growing \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n14/53 18-29769\r\ncynicism about democracy, we should not give up but \r\nrather defend and advocate for the values and virtues \r\nof democracy.\r\nMadam President, our dear friend and colleague \r\nMaría Fernanda Espinosa, you are the first Latin \r\nAmerican woman to preside over the Assembly. Ecuador \r\nis grateful for the support of our sister nations in your \r\nelection, and we are aware of the immense responsibility \r\nthat you have at the helm of this global forum.\r\nWe will all support work aimed at ensuring that the \r\nUnited Nations is relevant to our peoples. We are the \r\nOrganization that unites our nations in their concerns \r\nand their aspirations. We see the international efforts \r\nmade by the United Nations to care for us, for our \r\nchildren and for our neighbours. That is why we support \r\nits plan for disarmament; that is why we support the \r\nglobal compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, \r\nand why we promote the Convention on the Rights of \r\nPersons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol \r\n(resolution 61/106), along with a lenghty list of other \r\nactions, commitments and decisions.\r\nThe United Nations is our Organization. If there \r\nare f laws in it, let us correct them. We must not try to \r\ndisrupt it nor revoke funding from it, because we must \r\nstrengthen it if we want to provide our children with a \r\nbright future. If we are going to create complementary \r\norganizations — for example, in order to bolster \r\ntrade systems or specific regional projects on culture, \r\neducation or sport — these are most welcome, so long \r\nas their objectives are to strengthen the global union, \r\nto implement the Sustainable Development Goals and \r\nto honour all the historic commitments that we have \r\nundersigned. However, we do not believe in, nor should \r\nwe use, regional organizations to defend anachronistic, \r\nperverse and dictatorial systems, some of which were \r\nborn and then, fortunately, died in recent decades.\r\nThis institution is the most important living symbol \r\nof the world’s commitment to peace. For years we have \r\noften spoken at length about peace, but no one has been \r\nable to surpass Gandhi’s definition of peace as the sole \r\npath for humankind.\r\nPeace is our right. It is a sine qua non condition for \r\nlife and happiness. Ecuador is currently experiencing \r\nserious problems affecting our internal peace owing \r\nto violence on the northern border. We benefit greatly \r\nfrom mutual help from the President of Colombia, \r\nour dear friend Ivan Duque. We are also dealing with \r\ninternational crime and drug trafficking, and we have \r\nmade a commitment to put an end to them.\r\nAs each cause will have its effect, and each effect \r\ncontinues to transform itself into yet another cause, \r\nwe know that working for world peace is a constant \r\nobligation. This is because it has not yet fully taken \r\nroot in the heart of every human being. As a father and \r\na grandfather, I know that there will be no peace, if \r\nwe do not inculcate the proper values throughout our \r\npeoples’ lives. I know that kindness, for example, is \r\nnot a matter of public interest, and civility, honesty \r\nand transparency are not subjects taught in schools and \r\nuniversities, but they must be instilled in the hearts \r\nof all human beings. Otherwise, we will never lay the \r\nfoundations for a peaceful coexistence — the very goal \r\nof our Organization, which welcomes us today.\r\nAs a native of the Amazon region, I know very \r\nwell that there will be no peace if we do not preserve \r\nthe planet. We must regard the jungle not as simply \r\nthe lungs but as the heart of our world. As a person \r\nwith disabilities, I know that there will be no peace if \r\nwe do not embrace inclusion and celebrate diversity. \r\nDiversity does not mean suffering; diversity means \r\nliving and enjoying it. As a President, I know that peace \r\nis definitively favourable for those who are poorest and \r\nis crucial for those who are most in need. Peace ensures \r\nthat everyone, without exception, is free to realize their \r\ndreams every day for the rest of their lives.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Ecuador \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Lenin Moreno Garcés, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ecuador, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Donald Trump, President of the \r\nUnited States of America\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the United States of America.\r\nMr. Donald Trump, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Donald Trump, President of the \r\nUnited States of America, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 15/53\r\nPresident Trump: One year ago, I stood before \r\nthe Assembly for the first time in this Hall (see A/72/\r\nPV.3). I addressed the threats facing our world, and \r\nI presented a vision to achieve a brighter future for \r\nall of humankind. Today, I stand before the General \r\nAssembly to share the extraordinary progress that we \r\nhave made. In less than two years, my Administration \r\nhas accomplished more than almost any Administration \r\nin the history of our country.\r\nAmerica’s economy is booming like never before. \r\nSince my election, we have added $10 trillion in wealth. \r\nThe stock market is at an all-time high in history, \r\nand jobless claims are at a 50-year low. African-\r\nAmerican, Hispanic-American and Asian-American \r\nunemployment have all achieved their lowest levels ever \r\nrecorded. We have added more than 4 million new jobs, \r\nincluding half a million manufacturing jobs. We passed \r\nthe biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. \r\nWe started the construction of a major border wall and \r\nwe have greatly strengthened border security. We have \r\nsecured record funding for our military — $700 billion \r\nthis year and $716 billion next year. Our military will \r\nsoon be more powerful than it has ever been before.\r\nIn other words, the United States is a stronger, \r\nsafer and richer country than it was when I assumed \r\noffice less than two years ago. We are standing up for \r\nAmerica and for the American people. We are also \r\nstanding up for the world. This is great news for our \r\ncitizens and for peace-loving people everywhere. We \r\nbelieve that, when nations respect the rights of their \r\nneighbours and defend the interests of their people, \r\nthey can better work together to secure the blessings of \r\nsafety, prosperity and peace.\r\nEach of us here today is the emissary of a distinct \r\nculture, a rich history and a people bound together \r\nby ties of memory, tradition and the values that make \r\nour homelands like nowhere else on Earth. That is \r\nwhy America will always choose independence and \r\ncooperation over global governance, control and \r\ndomination. I honour the right of every nation in this \r\nHall to pursue its own customs, beliefs and traditions. \r\nThe United States will not tell nations how to live or \r\nwork or worship. We only ask that you honour our \r\nsovereignty in return.\r\nFrom Warsaw to Brussels and from Tokyo to \r\nSingapore, it has been my highest honour to represent \r\nthe United States abroad. I have forged close \r\nrelationships and friendships and strong partnerships \r\nwith the leaders of many nations in this Hall, and our \r\napproach has always yielded incredible change.\r\nWith support from many countries here today, we \r\nhave engaged with North Korea to replace the spectre \r\nof conflict with a bold and new push for peace. In \r\nJune, I travelled to Singapore to meet face to face with \r\nNorth Korea’s leader, Chairman Kim Jong Un. We had \r\nhighly productive conversations and meetings. And \r\nwe agreed that it was in both countries’ interests to \r\npursue the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. \r\nSince that meeting, we have already seen a number of \r\nencouraging measures that few could have imagined \r\nonly a short time ago.\r\nMissiles and rockets are no longer f lying in every \r\ndirection, nuclear testing has stopped and some military \r\nfacilities are already being dismantled. Our hostages \r\nhave been released and, as promised, the remains of our \r\nfallen heroes are being returned home to lay at rest in \r\nAmerican soil. I would like to thank Chairman Kim \r\nfor his courage and for the steps he has taken, though \r\nmuch work remains to be done. The sanctions will stay \r\nin place until denuclearization occurs.\r\nI also want to thank the many Member States \r\nwho helped us reach this moment — which is in fact \r\nfar greater than people might understand — for their \r\ncritical support, which we will all need going forward. \r\nI would also like to extend special thanks to President \r\nMoon of South Korea, Prime Minister Abe of Japan and \r\nPresident Xi of China.\r\nIn the Middle East, our new approach is also \r\nyielding great strides and historic change. Following \r\nmy trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Gulf countries \r\nopened a new centre to target terrorist financing. \r\nThey are enforcing new sanctions, working with us to \r\nidentify and track terrorist networks and taking more \r\nresponsibility for fighting terrorism and extremism in \r\ntheir own region.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar \r\nhave pledged billions of dollars to aid the people of \r\nSyria and Yemen. They are pursuing multiple avenues \r\nto end Yemen’s horrible, horrific civil war. Ultimately, \r\nit is up to the nations of the region to decide what kind \r\nof future they want for themselves and their children.\r\nFor that reason, the United States is working with \r\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council, Jordan and Egypt to \r\nestablish a regional strategic alliance so that Middle \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n16/53 18-29769\r\nEastern nations can advance prosperity, stability and \r\nsecurity across their home region.\r\nThanks to the United States military and our \r\npartnership with many nations, I am pleased to report \r\nthat the bloodthirsty killers known as the Islamic State \r\nin Iraq and the Sham have been driven out from the \r\nterritory they once held in Iraq and Syria. We will \r\ncontinue to work with friends and allies to deny radical \r\nIslamic terrorists any funding, territory or support or \r\nany means of infiltrating our borders.\r\nThe ongoing tragedy in Syria is heartbreaking. \r\nOur shared goals must be the de-escalation of military \r\nconflict, along with a political solution that honours \r\nthe will of the Syrian people. In this vein, we urge that \r\nthe United Nations-led peace process be reinvigorated. \r\nRest assured, the United States will respond if chemical \r\nweapons are deployed by the Al-Assad regime.\r\nI commend the people of Jordan and other \r\nneighbouring countries for hosting refugees from \r\nthis brutal civil war. As we see in Jordan, the most \r\ncompassionate policy is to place refugees as close to \r\ntheir homes as possible to ease their eventual return \r\nas part of the rebuilding process. This approach also \r\nstretches finite resources to help far more people, \r\nincreasing the impact of every dollar spent.\r\nEvery solution to the humanitarian crisis in Syria \r\nmust also include a strategy to address the brutal regime \r\nthat has fuelled and financed it: the corrupt dictatorship \r\nin Iran. Iran’s leaders sow chaos, death and destruction. \r\nThey do not respect their neighbours or borders or \r\nthe sovereign rights of nations. Instead, Iran’s leaders \r\nplunder the nation’s resources to enrich themselves and \r\nspread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond. \r\nThe Iranian people are rightly outraged that their \r\nleaders have embezzled billions of dollars from Iran’s \r\ntreasury, seized valuable portions of the economy and \r\nlooted the people’s religious endowments — all to line \r\ntheir own pockets and send their proxies to wage war. \r\nNot good.\r\nIran’s neighbours have paid a heavy toll for the \r\nregime’s agenda of aggression and expansion. That is \r\nwhy so many countries in the Middle East strongly \r\nsupported my decision to withdraw the United States \r\nfrom the horrible 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimpose \r\nnuclear sanctions. The Iran deal was a windfall for \r\nIran’s leaders. In the years since the deal was reached, \r\nIran’s military budget grew nearly 40 per cent. The \r\ndictatorship used the funds to build nuclear-capable \r\nmissiles, increase internal repression, finance terrorism \r\nand fund havoc and slaughter in Syria and Yemen.\r\nThe United States has launched a campaign of \r\neconomic pressure to deny the regime the funds it needs \r\nto advance its bloody agenda. Last month, we began \r\nreimposing hard-hitting nuclear sanctions that had been \r\nlifted under the Iran deal. Additional sanctions will \r\nresume 5 November, and more will follow. And we are \r\nworking with countries that import Iranian crude oil \r\nto cut their purchases substantially. We cannot allow \r\nthe world’s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the \r\nplanet’s most dangerous weapons. We cannot allow a \r\nregime that chants “Death to America” and threatens \r\nIsrael with annihilation to possess the means to deliver \r\na nuclear warhead to any city on Earth. We just cannot \r\ndo it. We ask all nations to isolate Iran’s regime as long \r\nas its aggression continues. And we ask all nations to \r\nsupport Iran’s people as they struggle to reclaim their \r\nreligious and righteous destiny.\r\nThis year, we also took another significant step \r\nforward in the Middle East. In recognition of every \r\nsovereign State’s right to determine its own capital, I \r\nmoved the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. \r\nThe United States is committed to a future of peace \r\nand stability in the region, including peace between the \r\nIsraelis and the Palestinians. That aim is advanced, not \r\nharmed, by acknowledging the obvious facts. America’s \r\npolicy of principled realism means we will not be held \r\nhostage to old dogmas, discredited ideologies and so-\r\ncalled experts who have been proven wrong over the \r\nyears, time and time again. That is true not only in \r\nmatters of peace, but in matters of prosperity.\r\nWe believe that trade must be fair and reciprocal. The \r\nUnited States will not be taken advantage of any longer. \r\nFor decades, the United States opened its economy — the \r\nlargest, by far, on Earth — with few conditions. We \r\nallowed foreign goods from all over the world to f low \r\nfreely across our borders. Yet other countries did not \r\ngrant us fair and reciprocal access to their markets \r\nin return. Even worse, some countries abused their \r\nopenness to dump their products, subsidize their goods, \r\ntarget our industries and manipulate their currencies to \r\ngain unfair advantage over our country. As a result, our \r\ntrade deficit ballooned to nearly $800 billion a year. For \r\nthat reason, we are systematically renegotiating broken \r\nand bad trade deals.\r\nLast month, we announced a ground-breaking United \r\nStates-Mexico trade agreement. And just yesterday, I \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 17/53\r\nstood with President Moon to announce the successful \r\ncompletion of the brand new United States-Korea trade \r\ndeal. And that is just the beginning. Many nations in this \r\nHall will agree that the world trading system is in dire \r\nneed of change. For example, countries were admitted \r\nto the World Trade Organization (WTO) that violate \r\nevery single principle on which the organization is \r\nbased. While the United States and many other nations \r\nplay by the rules, those countries use Government-run \r\nindustrial planning and State-owned enterprises to rig \r\nthe system in their favour. They engage in relentless \r\nproduct dumping, forced technology transfer and the \r\ntheft of intellectual property.\r\nThe United States lost more than 3 million \r\nmanufacturing jobs, nearly a quarter of all steel jobs \r\nand 60,000 factories after China joined the WTO. \r\nAnd we have racked up $13 trillion in trade deficits \r\nover the past two decades. But those days are over. We \r\nwill no longer tolerate such abuse. We will not allow \r\nour workers to be victimized, our companies to be \r\ncheated and our wealth to be plundered and transferred. \r\nAmerica will never apologize for protecting its citizens. \r\nThe United States has just announced tariffs on another \r\n$200 billion in Chinese-made goods — for a total, so \r\nfar, of $250 billion. I have great respect and affection for \r\nmy friend President Xi, but I have made it clear that our \r\ntrade imbalance is just not acceptable. China’s market \r\ndistortions and the way they deal cannot be tolerated. \r\nAs my Administration has demonstrated, America will \r\nalways act in our national interests.\r\nI spoke before this body last year (see A/72/PV.3) \r\nand warned that the Human Rights Council had become \r\na grave embarrassment to this institution, shielding \r\negregious human rights abusers while bashing America \r\nand its many friends. Our Ambassador to the United \r\nNations, Nikki Haley, laid out a clear agenda for \r\nreform, but despite reported and repeated warnings, \r\nno action at all was taken. The United States took the \r\nonly responsible course. We withdrew from the Human \r\nRights Council, and we will not return until real reform \r\nis enacted. For similar reasons, the United States will \r\nprovide no support or recognition to the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC). As far as America is concerned, \r\nthe ICC has no jurisdiction, no legitimacy and no \r\nauthority. The ICC claims near-universal jurisdiction \r\nover the citizens of every country, violating all \r\nprinciples of justice, fairness and due process. We will \r\nnever surrender America’s sovereignty to an unelected, \r\nunaccountable global bureaucracy. America is governed \r\nby Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism and \r\nwe embrace the doctrine of patriotism. Around the \r\nworld, responsible nations must defend against threats \r\nto sovereignty not just from global governance, but also \r\nfrom other new forms of coercion and domination.\r\nIn America, we believe strongly in energy security \r\nfor ourselves and for our allies. We have become the \r\nlargest energy producer anywhere on the face of the \r\nEarth. The United States stands ready to export our \r\nabundant, affordable supply of oil, clean coal and natural \r\ngas. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \r\n(OPEC) and OPEC nations, are, as usual, ripping off the \r\nrest of the world, and I do not like it. Nobody should \r\nlike it. We defend many of those nations for nothing, \r\nand then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil \r\nprices. Not good. We want them to stop raising prices. \r\nWe want them to start lowering prices. And they must \r\ncontribute substantially to military protection from now \r\non. We are not going to put up with such horrible prices \r\nmuch longer. Reliance on a single foreign supplier can \r\nleave a nation vulnerable to extortion and intimidation. \r\nThat is why we congratulate European States, such as \r\nPoland, for leading the construction of a Baltic pipeline \r\nso that nations are not dependent on Russia to meet their \r\nenergy needs. Germany will become totally dependent \r\non Russian energy if it does not immediately change \r\nits course.\r\nHere, in the western hemisphere, we are committed \r\nto maintaining our independence from the encroachment \r\nof expansionist foreign powers. It has been the formal \r\npolicy of our country since President Monroe to reject \r\nthe interference of foreign nations in this hemisphere \r\nand in our own affairs.\r\nThe United States recently strengthened our laws \r\nto better screen foreign investments in our country for \r\nnational security threats, and we welcome cooperation \r\nwith countries in the region and around the world \r\nthat wish to do the same. You need to do it for your \r\nown protection.\r\nThe United States is also working with partners in \r\nLatin America to confront threats to sovereignty from \r\nuncontrolled migration. Tolerance of human smuggling \r\nand trafficking is not humane. It is horrible thing that \r\nis going on, at levels that nobody has ever seen before. \r\nIt is very cruel. Illegal immigration funds criminal \r\nnetworks, ruthless gangs and the f low of deadly drugs. \r\nIllegal immigration exploits vulnerable populations, \r\nhurts hard-working citizens and has produced a vicious \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n18/53 18-29769\r\ncycle of crime, violence and poverty. Only by upholding \r\nnational borders and destroying criminal gangs can \r\nwe break that cycle and establish a real foundation \r\nfor prosperity.\r\nWe recognize the right of every nation in this Hall \r\nto set its own immigration policy in accordance with \r\nits national interests, just as we ask other countries \r\nto respect our own right to do the same — which \r\nwe are doing. That is one reason the United States \r\nwill not participate in the new global compact for \r\nmigration. Migration should not be governed by an \r\ninternational body that is unaccountable to our own \r\ncitizens. Ultimately, the only long-term solution to the \r\nmigration crisis is to help people build more hopeful \r\nfutures in their home countries, to make their countries \r\ngreat again.\r\nCurrently, we are witnessing a human tragedy, to \r\ngive an example, in Venezuela. More than 2 million \r\npeople have f led the anguish inflicted by the socialist \r\nMaduro regime and its Cuban sponsors. Not long ago, \r\nVenezuela was one of the richest countries on Earth. \r\nToday socialism has bankrupted the oil-rich nation \r\nand driven its people into abject poverty. Almost \r\neverywhere socialism or communism has been tried, it \r\nhas produced suffering, corruption and decay.\r\nSocialism’s thirst for power leads to expansion, \r\nincursion and oppression. All nations of the world \r\nshould resist socialism and the misery that it brings \r\nto everyone. In that spirit, we ask the nations that are \r\ngathered here to join us in calling for the restoration \r\nof democracy in Venezuela. Today we are announcing \r\nadditional sanctions against the repressive regime, \r\ntargeting Maduro’s inner circle and close advisers.\r\nWe are grateful for all the work the United Nations \r\ndoes around the world to help people build better lives \r\nfor themselves and their families. The United States \r\nis by far the world’s largest giver of foreign aid, but \r\nfew give anything to us. That is why we are taking a \r\nhard look at United States foreign assistance. That will \r\nbe headed up by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. We \r\nwill examine what is working, what is not working \r\nand whether the countries that receive our dollars and \r\nour protection also have our interests at heart. Moving \r\nforward, we are only going to give foreign aid to those \r\nthat respect us and, frankly, are our friends. We expect \r\nother countries to pay their fair share of the cost of \r\ntheir defence.\r\nThe United States is committed to making the \r\nUnited Nations more effective and accountable. I have \r\nsaid many times that the United Nations has unlimited \r\npotential. As part of our reform effort, I have told our \r\nnegotiators that the United States will not pay more \r\nthan 25 per cent of the United Nations peacekeeping \r\nbudget. That will encourage other countries to step up, \r\nget involved and share the very large burden. We are \r\nworking to shift more of our funding from assessed \r\nto voluntary contributions, so that we can target \r\nAmerican resources to the programmes with the best \r\nrecord of success. Only when each of us does its part \r\nand contributes its share can we realize the highest \r\naspirations of the United Nations.\r\nWe must pursue peace without fear, hope without \r\ndespair and security without apology. Looking around \r\nthis Hall, where so much history has transpired, we \r\nthink of the many before us who have come here to \r\naddress the challenges of their nations and times. Our \r\nthoughts turn to the same question that ran through all \r\ntheir speeches and resolutions, through every word and \r\nevery hope. It is a question of what kind of world we \r\nwill leave for our children and what kind of nations they \r\nwill inherit. The dreams that fill this Hall today are as \r\ndiverse as the people that have stood at this rostrum, \r\nand as varied as the countries represented here in this \r\nbody. It really is something. It really is great history.\r\nThere is India, a free society with more than \r\n1 billion people, successfully lifting countless millions \r\nout of poverty and into the middle class. There is Saudi \r\nArabia, where King Salman and the Crown Prince are \r\npursuing bold new reforms. There is Israel, proudly \r\ncelebrating its seventieth anniversary as a thriving \r\ndemocracy in the holy land. In Poland, a great people \r\nare standing up for their independence, security and \r\nsovereignty. Many countries are pursuing their own \r\nunique visions, building their own hopeful futures and \r\nchasing their own wonderful dreams of destiny, legacy \r\nand a home. The whole world is richer and humanity is \r\nbetter because of this beautiful constellation of nations, \r\neach very special, each very unique and each shining \r\nbrightly in its part of the world. In each one, we see \r\nthe awesome promise of a people bound together by a \r\nshared past and working towards a common future.\r\nAs for Americans, we know what kind of future we \r\nwant for ourselves. We know what kind of nation America \r\nmust always be. In America we believe in the majesty \r\nof freedom and the dignity of the individual. We believe \r\nin self-government and the rule of law. And we prize \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 19/53\r\nthe culture that sustains our liberty — a culture built \r\non strong families, deep faith and fierce independence. \r\nWe celebrate our heroes, we treasure our traditions and, \r\nabove all, we love our country.\r\nInside everyone in this great Hall today, and \r\neveryone listening around the globe, there is the heart \r\nof a patriot that feels the same powerful love for your \r\nnation and the same intense loyalty to your homeland. \r\nThe passion that burns in the hearts of patriots and the \r\nsouls of nations has inspired reform and revolution, \r\nsacrifice and self lessness, scientific breakthroughs and \r\nmagnificent works of art. Our task is not to erase it, but \r\nto embrace it — to build with it, to draw on its ancient \r\nwisdom and to find within it the will to make our \r\nnations greater, our regions safer and the world better.\r\nTo unleash that incredible potential in our people, \r\nwe must defend the foundations that make it all possible. \r\nSovereign and independent nations are the only vehicles \r\nwhere freedom has ever survived, democracy has ever \r\nendured and peace has ever prospered. And so we must \r\nprotect our sovereignty and our cherished independence \r\nabove all. When we do, we will find new avenues for \r\ncooperation unfolding before us. We will find a new \r\npassion for peacemaking rising within us. We will find \r\nnew purpose, new resolve and new spirit f lourishing all \r\naround us and making this a more beautiful world in \r\nwhich to live.\r\nTogether let us choose a future of patriotism, \r\nprosperity and pride. Let us choose peace and \r\nfreedom over domination and defeat. Let us come \r\nhere to this place to stand up for our people and their \r\nnations — forever strong, forever sovereign, forever \r\njust and forever thankful for the grace, goodness and \r\nglory of God. God bless you and God bless the nations \r\nof the world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the United States of \r\nAmerica for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Donald Trump, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 11.15 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.20 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President \r\nof the Republic of Turkey\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey.\r\nMr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Recep Tayyip \r\nErdoğan, President of the Republic of Turkey, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Erdoğan (spoke in Turkish; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I have the \r\nhonour to greet you personally, Madam President, on \r\nbehalf of my country and my people.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank His Excellency \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák for his successful work over the \r\npast year as the President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session. I would also like to congratulate \r\nMs. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, who has taken \r\nover the presidency of the General Assembly. I hope \r\nand pray that this year’s General Assembly session will \r\navail us of an opportunity to bring the best to all people \r\nof the world.\r\nWe are holding this meeting on the 100th \r\nanniversary of the end of the First World War. The \r\nLeague of Nations, which was founded after the war, \r\nwas immediately replaced by the United Nations in \r\nthe aftermath of the Second World War. Undoubtedly, \r\nthe United Nations, over its 73 years of history, has \r\ncarried out enormous endeavours and achieved great \r\nsuccesses. However, we also need to admit the fact that \r\nover time the capacity of the United Nations to meet \r\nthe expectations of humankind for peace and welfare \r\nhas diminished.\r\nIn particular, the Security Council has taken to \r\nserving only the interests of its five permanent seat-\r\nholders, which have veto rights, while standing by idly \r\nin the face of oppression in other parts of the world. \r\nThe massacres in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda \r\nand Somalia, and recently in Myanmar and occurring \r\nin Palestine as we speak, have all taken place before the \r\neyes of the Security Council. Those who remain silent \r\nin the face of the oppression of the Palestinians, those \r\nwho have reduced humanitarian assistance for them, \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n20/53 18-29769\r\nare only increasing the courage of the oppressors. Even \r\nif the whole world turns its back, Turkey will continue \r\nto be on the side of the oppressed Palestinians and will \r\nprotect the historical and legal status of our first qibla, \r\nwhich is Jerusalem.\r\nUnfortunately, in many parts of the world, every \r\nday we confront scenes of ethnic cleansing and mass \r\nslaughter that none of us would wish to see. Likewise, \r\nfrom health to education, from food to culture, there \r\nis a high level of dissatisfaction in terms of the sum of \r\nthe work undertaken by this huge Organization. We do \r\nnot wish to see such an important structure turn into an \r\norganization with a constant reputation for failure and \r\ncomplaints. Therefore, on every occasion, we underline \r\nthat there needs to be a comprehensive reform in the \r\nstructure and functioning of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly of the Security Council.\r\nWe believe that when we say “the world is greater \r\nthan five” we are becoming the voice of the common \r\nconscience of the entire human race. The world is not \r\nthe world of the times of the Second World War, nor \r\nof its aftermath. We have representatives from 194 \r\ncountries under this roof. Why cannot 194 countries be \r\nrepresented at the Security Council? Why should they \r\nnot, in a rotational manner, have their permanent seats \r\nin the Security Council? We have only five permanent \r\nseat-holders at the Security Council, and the remainder \r\nare just temporary with no power whatsoever.\r\nLimiting the reform of the United Nations to the \r\nbudget will neither contribute to the settlement of real \r\nproblems nor make anybody happy or content. There is \r\na need to increase the efficiency of the Organization, \r\nwhich I deem to be very important for the future of \r\nthe world. That includes in the fundamental areas of \r\nsocial equality, development and security. We need to \r\nundertake many reforms.\r\nWhen Turkey looks at the world — beginning \r\nwith our own geography — we see that there are \r\nmany important tasks to be undertaken by the United \r\nNations. In our understanding, justice is above all, and \r\nit will bring order, salvation and happiness to the entire \r\nworld. In our civilization we refer to a phenomenon \r\nknown as the “circle of justice,” which is based on a \r\ncorrect establishment and management of relations \r\nbetween the society, the law, the State, the power of the \r\nState, the economy and justice. The links of that circle \r\nare intertwined; however, those links are shattered \r\nregardless of where you go in the world today. That is \r\nwhy our world today is entrapped by political, social \r\nand economic instability and is constantly suffering.\r\nTo enable a peaceful and secure future for all, \r\nwe have a duty to succeed in humankind’s struggle, \r\nstarting with the search for justice and ending with the \r\nestablishment of justice. Today, when the assets of the \r\nwealthiest 62 people in the world amount to the assets \r\nof half of world’s population of 3.6 billion people, it \r\nmeans there is a significant problem that we need to \r\ndo something about. Every night 821 million people go \r\nto bed hungry; at the same time more than 672 million \r\nhave been diagnosed with obesity. There is a problem \r\nwith that. There are 258 million people across the \r\nworld hitting the road in search for better conditions \r\nto live and survive. And there are 68 million displaced \r\npeople around the world, which points to yet another \r\noutstanding problem that we need to do something \r\nabout. There is a problem when the likelihood of early \r\nchild mortality of a baby born in Africa is nine times \r\ngreater than that of a baby born here.\r\nThe famous Islamic philosopher Rumi, who \r\nbegan shining a beacon from the city of Konya, in the \r\nheartland of Anatolia, in order to enlighten all souls \r\nacross the world, once said that justice means restoring \r\nthings to their proper place — that is. giving someone \r\nwhat he or she needs or desires. Let us establish a global \r\nadministration system that will serve as a shield to \r\nprotect the oppressed, the victimized, lending a helping \r\nhand to the hungry and the unsheltered, and thereby \r\nbringing hope to future generations.\r\nEverything said from this rostrum, all the analyses \r\nand proposals that we come up with, will make sense \r\nonly if we can put them into action. Again, according \r\nto the philosopher Rumi, an oppressor is someone who \r\ndoes not fulfil their duties vis-à-vis humankind. If we \r\nwant to make the United Nations a source of justice \r\ninstead of cruelty, we have to dedicate ourselves more \r\nfully to the tasks bestowed upon us.\r\nTurkey is sustaining its efforts aimed at achieving a \r\nfairer world through its global humanitarian diplomacy. \r\nWe are currently hosting 4 million refugees inside our \r\nborders, 3.5 million of whom came from Syria. On a \r\nglobal scale, this is unprecedented. Those refugees \r\nhave access to all forms of services that one could ever \r\nneed. So far, the Republic of Turkey has spent about \r\n$32 billion for the care of refugees. Furthermore, in \r\ncities such as Jarablus, Al-Rai and Afrin in Syria, which \r\nwe previously secured, we have provided humanitarian \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 21/53\r\naid to millions of people in need just as has been done \r\nin the de-escalation zones that were recently declared \r\nin the city of Idlib.\r\nThe number of Syrian students attending school \r\nin Turkey is well above 600,000. Refugees in our \r\ncountry have access to all health-care services free of \r\ncharge, just like any other Turkish citizen. In addition, \r\nwe attend to all the needs of refugees in Turkish \r\nprotection centres. However, so far, we have received \r\nonly $600 million from international organizations \r\nand only €1.7 billion from the European Union (EU). \r\nThose funds are not going directly into the Turkish \r\nbudget, but rather are being directly transferred to the \r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) working for \r\nthe refugees. The European Union previously pledged \r\n€3 billion to be allocated to Turkey, but that is now \r\ncontingent upon the undertaking of specific projects. \r\nWe continue providing our services to refugees \r\nevery day without any preconditions or interruptions \r\nwhatsoever. We expect more generous and f lexible \r\nsupport to be provided to Turkey, especially by the EU, \r\nbecause we have prevented a large refugee influx to \r\nspill over into other parts of the world, in particular \r\nto Europe, thanks to the opportunities we have made \r\navailable to refugees.\r\nFurthermore, we are providing significant \r\nhumanitarian development aid in all parts of the world, \r\nnot just to refugees within or near our borders. As of \r\nthis year, Turkey ranks sixth in the world in terms \r\nof total development aid and first in humanitarian \r\nassistance. Turkey ranks among the top donors in \r\nterms of development and humanitarian aid, as we \r\nare the seventeenth largest economy in the world. Our \r\ncommitment is a strong expression of the degree of \r\nsignificance we attach to humanitarian aid and helping \r\nthose in need.\r\nAs noted in the appeal by the General Assembly \r\nthis year, our world needs global leadership and joint \r\nresponsibility more than ever for peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies. Turkey has made substantial \r\nefforts in that direction within the United Nations. \r\nThe Mediation for Peace initiative, which we launched \r\ntogether with Finland in 2010, is now supported by \r\nthe Group of Friends of Mediation, which consists of \r\n56 Member States. We have also taken serious steps \r\nforward in that regard within the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation, over which we currently preside.\r\nThe Alliance of Civilizations initiative, which we \r\nlaunched with Spain, has become a United Nations \r\ninitiative with the participation of 146 Member States. \r\nIn helping Somalia, which is struggling with hunger, \r\nget back on its feet, we are currently implementing \r\na development programme that I believe will be a \r\nmodel for the rest of the world. And to help millions of \r\ninnocent people in Arakan, which is miles away from \r\nour country, we have mobilized all our means and all our \r\ncapabilities. We have exerted sincere efforts to resolve \r\nthe Gulf crisis. In Iraq, we are encouraging all parties \r\nto make efforts to secure the future of the country. In \r\nterms of racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia, we \r\nstrive to prevent negativity from emerging in various \r\nparts of the world, especially in Europe.\r\nWe have also adopted an active stance in response \r\nto the developments taking place in Syria, which has \r\nnow become a place where the majority of the countries \r\nin the world export the radical groups residing within \r\ntheir borders. By means of both our support to the \r\nGeneva and Astana processes and the de-escalation \r\nzones that have been established, we continue to try to \r\nbring peace and stability to Syria, and we are trying to \r\nmake Syria a peaceful country once again. By clearing \r\nthe Jarablus and Al-Rai regions of the presence of the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Sham and the Afrin region \r\nfrom the presence of the Kurdistan Workers Party, the \r\nDemocratic Union Party and the People’s Protection \r\nUnits — terrorist organizations all — we have turned \r\nan area of more than 4,000 square kilometres into a safe \r\nand peaceful place for millions of Syrians.\r\nQuite recently, we signed an agreement with Russia, \r\nthe Sochi Agreement, through which we have prevented \r\nthe regime’s bloody assaults against the de-escalation \r\nzones in Idlib province, where 3.5 million civilians \r\nlive. It is our belief that, by preventing a repetition of \r\nthe massacres previously carried out in Aleppo, Hama, \r\nHoms, Dar’a and eastern Ghouta, Turkey has cleared \r\nthe way for peace and a political solution in the country, \r\nespecially in the Idlib. Our goal is to clear the Syrian \r\nterritory of the presence of terrorists, all the way \r\nfrom Manbij to the Iraqi border. I hereby call upon all \r\nthe parties to support a just and sustainable political \r\nsolution in Syria through a constructive approach. We \r\nwish to see a principled approach taken against all \r\nterrorist organizations.\r\nThose who equip terrorists with tens of thousands of \r\ntrucks and thousands of cargo planes loaded with arms \r\nand ammunition for the sake of their tactical interests \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n22/53 18-29769\r\nwill most definitely feel sorrow and regret in future for \r\nhaving done so. Supporting terrorist organizations and \r\nclosing borders to refugees, all the while putting the \r\nentire burden on a few countries like Turkey, will not \r\ngive the world a more secure or prosperous future. On \r\nthe contrary, issues deflected in such a way will reach \r\na point where one day the measures at hand will fall \r\nshort of overcoming them. So let us make more sincere \r\nand constructive efforts aimed at finding solutions \r\nin regions currently in conflict, such as Syria, Iraq, \r\nYemen, Libya, Afghanistan and Ukraine, as well as in \r\nregions potentially in conflict, such as the Balkans, the \r\nCaucusus, North Africa, Central Africa, the Gulf and \r\nthe eastern Mediterranean. Let us not forget that, if we \r\ncannot create a minimum level of peace and prosperity \r\nfor all in every part of the world, no one can live safely \r\nwithin their own borders.\r\nNot all terrorist organizations obtain their power \r\nsolely from their armed actions. Some of them use more \r\ncomplex, more convert and more deceptive methods. \r\nThe Fethullah terrorist organization attempted a coup \r\non the night of 15 July 2016, and, in the end, 251 \r\nTurkish civilians were martyred and more than 2,193 \r\ncivilians were wounded. That is the sort of terrorist \r\norganization I was referring to just now. The Fethullah \r\nterrorist organization is hiding behind such glossy \r\nconcepts as education, welfare and dialogue, and it \r\ncontinues its operations as NGOs or businesses. The \r\nleader of this terrorist organization is currently living \r\nin very comfortable fashion in Pennsylvania, on more \r\nthan 400 acres of land.\r\nFor the last four decades, this terrorist organization \r\nhas been growing and developing in Turkey through \r\ndeception, and we saw its true face when the \r\nterrorists felt that they had become powerful enough \r\nto undertake coups d’état. They initiated consecutive \r\nattempts, first with their operatives who had infiltrated \r\nthe police and the judiciary in Turkey, and then with \r\ntheir agents in the armed forces. With the economic \r\nand bureaucratic power they attained over time, that \r\nterrorist organization has attempted to take control of \r\npolitics, society and the State itself. However, thanks \r\nto the support of our people and to our resolute fight \r\nagainst the Fethullah terrorist organization over the \r\npast five years, we have eliminated the majority of \r\nmembers of that organization in our country. We can \r\nnow see that this terrorist organization is carrying out \r\nsimilar activities across the globe. We are warning \r\nmany countries that are friends of Turkey around the \r\nworld and demanding the extradition of the terrorists \r\nhiding within their borders, but some of those countries \r\nare shying away from extraditing them. Ultimately, \r\nhowever, the price for such a failure will be quite hefty.\r\nThe Fethullah terrorist organization is generating \r\nbetween $700 million and $800 million in the United \r\nStates through their charter schools located in different \r\nstates throughout the country. That figure does not \r\ninclude the income generated by commercial institutions \r\ninvolved in all sorts of money laundering activities and \r\nother structures with secret agendas that appear to be \r\nNGOs. I am hurt, and that is why I am frankly warning \r\ncountries that are friends of Turkey around the world. \r\nI invite them to mobilize their efforts to combat the \r\npresence of the Fethullah terrorist organization in their \r\ncountries. We must show the same solidarity that we \r\nhave shown with regard to armed terrorist organizations \r\nand bloodthirsty regimes with regard to that insidious \r\ngang as well. We are ready to share our experiences \r\nand the information we have gathered on that issue with \r\ncountries that are friends of Turkey and any country \r\nthat is willing to cooperate with us more closely.\r\nTrade wars have harmed humankind in every \r\nage. We are on the brink of another such frightening \r\nwar. None of us can remain silent in the face of \r\narbitrary cancellations of commercial agreements, \r\nthe spreading prevalence of protectionism and the \r\nuse of economic sanctions as weapons. The negative \r\neffects of those twisted developments will eventually \r\naffect all countries. We must all work together to \r\nprevent damage to the world trade regime as a result of \r\nunilateral decisions in the form of sanctions. At a time \r\nwhen we need to work towards the achievement of the \r\n2030 Sustainable Development Goals, no one wants the \r\nworld to experience a new economic rupture.\r\nIt is easy to create chaos, but it is difficult to \r\nrestore order. Today, unfortunately, some countries \r\nare persistently trying to create chaos. There is no \r\nbigger danger than a world order that has lost mercy, \r\nconscience, truth and hope. That is the danger we \r\nare facing now. Turkey has always been in favour of \r\nboth free trade and the free movement of persons and \r\ngoods. Every regression in those areas has negative \r\nrepercussions that will be hard to overcome for future \r\ngenerations. Furthermore, the fact that this approach \r\nis brought up with a rhetoric of threat, force and by \r\nentirely disregarding the history of bilateral relations \r\ndisappoints us even more. We are in favour of solving \r\nour problems through constructive dialogue on equal \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 23/53\r\nterms. We expect responsible action by all our friends \r\naround the world.\r\nWe have effective, harmonious and constructive \r\ncooperation with our counterparts on international \r\nplatforms, such as the World Trade Organization, the \r\nGroup of 20, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation \r\nand the European Union in the form of the Customs \r\nUnion. Turkey has always expressed its support for \r\na win-win approach to those we do business with \r\naround the world. The sincerity of our approach is \r\nobvious, which is why we deem the allegations against \r\nand pressure on our country unfair. We believe that, \r\ntogether with the countries and institutions sharing \r\nour perspective, we can surmount the political and \r\neconomic chaos that the world is being drawn into. We \r\nhope to receive the international community’s support \r\nin that respect.\r\nBefore concluding my address, I would like to share \r\nwith the Assembly two additional remarks.\r\nFirst, we believe that there is a need for an \r\ninstitution within the United Nations for youth, as young \r\npeople ensure the sustainability of our future. Turkey \r\nproposes the establishment of a United Nations youth \r\norganization as soon as possible, and suggests Istanbul, \r\na city that symbolizes the history of the world, as its \r\nheadquarters. We can allocate a youth centre, which is \r\ncurrently being built in Istanbul, to that organization.\r\nSecondly, in 2005, we hosted the world ageing \r\nsummit in Turkey for the first time, and then 2019 was \r\ndesignated the International Year of Older Persons. In \r\nthat respect, the United Nations international agency \r\nfor the elderly is being established in Istanbul, and the \r\nthird World Assembly on Ageing will take place in \r\nIstanbul. I cordially invite representatives to attend that \r\nsummit, which will be held on 10 December.\r\nOnce again, I wish every success to the General \r\nAssembly during its seventy-third session. On behalf \r\nof myself and my country, I wholeheartedly salute with \r\nrespect all the countries and peoples represented in this \r\ncommon parliament of humankind. May they prevail in \r\npeace and in health.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the \r\nRepublic of Rwanda\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Rwanda.\r\nMr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic \r\nof Rwanda, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Paul Kagame, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Rwanda, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kagame: As we gather in this Hall and \r\nwork together to make the United Nations more relevant \r\nto all people, the positive developments in Africa over \r\nthe past year merit this body’s attention. Let me start \r\nwith a paradox.\r\nIn no other region is the sense of transnational \r\nsolidarity and unity as deeply felt as in Africa. The \r\nidea that our respective national identities stand in \r\ncontradiction to pan-Africanism is unheard of in our \r\ncontext. And yet, despite that unique civic endowment, \r\nAfrica has too often stood out for division and \r\ndysfunction in practice. That left Africa unable to \r\narticulate and advance its common interests. We ceded \r\nresponsibility for our future to others not by force but \r\nby default.\r\nMr. Bahr Aluloom (Iraq), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nBut times are changing rapidly, and therefore the \r\nmanagement of Africa’s global position must also \r\nchange. The trend on our continent is towards closer and \r\nmore productive cooperation, both through the African \r\nUnion and our regional economic communities. The \r\nevident decline of old certainties and authorities is not \r\nbringing turbulence to Africa, as would have been the \r\ncase in a previous era. On the contrary, the effect has \r\nbeen to focus Africa’s attention on the urgent need to \r\nget our house in order and fundamentally change how \r\nwe do business. That is why the African Union initiated \r\na major financial and institutional reform more than \r\nthree years ago. We are already seeing practical results.\r\nNew financial discipline has produced an African \r\nUnion budget that is 12 per cent lower than last year’s. \r\nThe share of funding supplied by member States has also \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n24/53 18-29769\r\nincreased substantially. Contributions to the fund that \r\nhelps pay for African Union peace support operations \r\nare at the highest level since its establishment, in 1993. \r\nAnd earlier this year, the historic agreement on the \r\nAfrican Continental Free Trade Area was signed, which \r\nwas the culmination of decades of effort. Once that is in \r\nforce, Africa’s place in the global economic and trade \r\narchitecture will be redefined.\r\nEconomies of scale and higher levels of \r\nintra-African trade will help our continent attain the \r\nSustainable Development Goals by 2030. We will also \r\nsee new possibilities for public-private partnership with \r\nAfrica’s growing private sector. This year also provided \r\nexamples of regional security affairs and key political \r\ntransitions being handled in a peaceful and forward-\r\nlooking manner. More effective consultation and \r\nleadership is reducing the need for external mediation, \r\nand that is how it should be.\r\nThe momentous developments in the Horn of \r\nAfrica — in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti and even \r\nSomalia — are the most remarkable. The region’s leaders \r\ndeserve our full support as they set aside decades of \r\nmistrust and work towards a comprehensive settlement. \r\nIt is important for the Security Council to collaborate \r\nclosely with the African Union to accompany that \r\nprocess of normalization.\r\nIn Zimbabwe as well, the next stages on the country’s \r\npath of progress warrant steady encouragement from \r\nthe international community. However, there are other \r\nsituations in Africa — notably in the Central African \r\nRepublic, Libya, the Sahel and South Sudan — where \r\nserious problems remain unresolved, despite so much \r\npotential. Africa and the world should come together \r\nand do what needs to be done to harmonize overlapping \r\ninitiatives and ensure that agreements are respected.\r\nPeace and security are the foundation of economic \r\nand social well-being. Yesterday we happily marked the \r\ncentenary of Nelson Mandela’s birth with the Nelson \r\nMandela Peace Summit. In that spirit, we are already \r\nset to embark upon a new chapter, with cooperation \r\nbetween the African Union and the United Nations \r\non stable funding for African-Union-mandated \r\npeace-support operations. The draft resolution to be \r\nintroduced by Africa’s three Security Council members \r\nhas the full backing of the African Union. That step \r\nwill also align with the Secretary-General’s new Action \r\nfor Peacekeeping initiative. That once again reflects the \r\nfact that the dividend of a more focused and functional \r\nAfrica benefits everyone.\r\nIn that wider context of even stronger partnership \r\nbetween our institutions, it is important for the African \r\nUnion’s diplomatic representation here at the United \r\nNations to be accorded the status and weight enjoyed by \r\nother regional bodies. The theme for this year’s general \r\ndebate is “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople”. That requires a commitment to achieving real \r\nmultilateralism where it has too often been lacking. \r\nThe current two-track system of global governance is \r\nunsustainable. A few get to be the ones to define the \r\nnorms by which others shall be judged. But standards \r\nthat do not apply to everyone equally are not universal. \r\nAddressing that imbalance in the very foundation \r\nof our system is what will give shape to a revival of \r\nmultilateral cooperation and renew the legitimacy of \r\nthe international institutions that are so crucial to our \r\nplanet’s future.\r\nIn the years ahead, we look forward to deepening \r\nthe important partnership between Africa and the \r\nUnited Nations and to advancing our shared agenda \r\nof peace and security, gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment, environmental protection and \r\nshared prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Rwanda for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic \r\nof Rwanda, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of \r\nthe United Mexican States\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe United Mexican States.\r\nMr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of the United \r\nMexican States, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Enrique Peña \r\nNieto, President of the United Mexican States, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 25/53\r\nPresident Peña Nieto: I congratulate Ambassador \r\nMaría Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. I welcome the fact \r\nthat, for the first time in history, a Latin American \r\nwoman is presiding over the work of the Assembly.\r\nSince the founding of the Organization, Mexico has \r\ndemonstrated its willingness to help make the ideals \r\nthat gave rise to its creation into a reality. As Mexicans, \r\nwe are aware of our responsibilities as a nation that \r\nis part of a community of sovereign and independent \r\nStates. Successive generations have managed to build \r\nMexico into a democratic and pluralistic State, a free \r\nand participatory society and a dynamic economy open \r\nto the world. At the same time, we have contributed to \r\ndeliberations and action focused on the great challenges \r\nfacing the international community in the quest for \r\npeace and security, the promotion of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and respect for human rights. Those are \r\nuniversal values that have inspired and guided Mexico’s \r\nefforts to overcome the challenges facing our society.\r\nWith the commitment and cooperation of the three \r\nbranches of our Government, various political parties, \r\ncivil-society organizations and representatives of the \r\nvarious economic sectors, Mexico is moving forward \r\ntowards improved levels of wealth and development. \r\nWe have striven to strengthen our institutions and \r\nprotect our society from the threat of crime and \r\nviolence in the quest for a Mexico living in peace. We \r\nhave worked to improve the living conditions of the \r\nmost vulnerable groups by reducing poverty levels and \r\nbuilding an inclusive Mexico. We have transformed the \r\nMexican educational system so that it can provide the \r\nchildren and young people of the country with quality \r\neducation that will prepare them for a successful and \r\nhappy life. We have removed barriers that, for decades, \r\nimpeded full economic development, thereby fuelling \r\na prosperous Mexico. We have taken an active role in \r\nfinding solutions to international challenges, which is \r\nfitting for one of the 10 most populous countries, one of \r\nthe 15 largest economies in the world, and a responsible \r\nglobal actor.\r\nMy country has made a sense of responsibility \r\nthe watchword of its foreign policy. Mexico has acted \r\nresponsibly in promoting sustainable development, \r\nwhich benefits everyone. For that reason, we have \r\nestablished an institutional architecture, in cooperation \r\nwith the federal executive power, to promote the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. Together with \r\nother countries represented in this Hall, we have \r\npromoted the annual assessment of the impact of rapid \r\ntechnological change, especially artificial intelligence, \r\non the achievement of the 2030 Agenda.\r\nThe implementation of the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change is a priority for my country. As an \r\ninternational community, we have a moral obligation \r\nto put its precepts into practice and meet even more \r\nambitious mitigation, adaptation and financing goals. \r\nMexico has acted responsibly in seeking for solutions \r\nto the challenges posed by migration. I welcome the \r\nprogress that we have made in achieving the global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration. Based \r\non the new development paradigm, the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Mexico and Switzerland have \r\nworked over the past two years with States, civil-society \r\norganizations, international organizations and academia \r\nto establish the following guiding principles of the pact: \r\nrespect for the human rights of all migrants regardless \r\nof their immigration status, shared responsibility and \r\nunrestricted respect for the sovereignty of States, \r\namong others. The upcoming official adoption of that \r\ninstrument in Marrakech in December will allow us to \r\nrely on a foundational document for the international \r\ngovernance of migration.\r\nMexico has acted responsibly in promoting \r\ninternational peace and security. Following a hiatus \r\nof more than two decades, Mexico has resumed its \r\nparticipation in peacekeeping operations. In recent \r\nyears, we have contributed to operations deployed in \r\nAfrica, the Middle East and Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. Mexico also has made its mark in its struggle \r\nfor the total elimination of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nparticularly nuclear disarmament. Accordingly, we \r\ninitiated and supported the process concluded in 2017 \r\nwith the negotiation of the Treaty on the Prohibition \r\nof Nuclear Weapons, which Mexico ratified in January. \r\nWe urge all Member States that have not yet done so to \r\nsign and ratify the Treaty without delay.\r\nWeapons of mass destruction are not the only threat \r\nto society. The illicit trade in weapons is one of the \r\ngreatest challenges to national security that Mexico, \r\nlike many other countries, has had to face. I say this \r\nin no uncertain terms — given its serious nature, \r\ntrafficking in illicit weapons is a scourge that we must \r\nurgently address. One important step to advance that \r\nstruggle was the negotiation and adoption of the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty. The first Conference of States Parties to \r\nthe Treaty was held in Mexico in 2014. We must now \r\nwork on its implementation. The outcome of the 2016 \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n26/53 18-29769\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the world \r\ndrug problem was a watershed in the international \r\ndrug-control system. Its implementation will allow us \r\nto move from mere prohibition to effective regulation \r\nthat combines prevention, public health and human \r\nrights approaches.\r\nMexico has acted responsibly in the promotion \r\nof human rights. We acknowledge that our country \r\ncontinues to face major challenges in terms of \r\nhuman rights, and we have therefore implemented \r\nspecific public policies to address them. Mexico has \r\nmaintained its openness to international scrutiny, as \r\nwe know that it serves as a useful tool to strengthen \r\nour national legal frameworks and promote human \r\nrights in the country. In its efforts to promote human \r\nrights, the international community must continue to \r\npromote respect for fundamental democratic principles \r\nthroughout the world. The usurpation of powers, the \r\nsystematic violation of political rights, the rupture \r\nof the democratic order and the humanitarian crisis \r\nprevailing in some areas of the American continent are \r\nissues that deeply concern us. Mexico will pursue its \r\nbest diplomatic efforts to ensure that democracy, peace \r\nand respect for human rights are restored in all corners \r\nof the continent. We will always seek peaceful solutions \r\nagreed by the citizens of those countries, in full respect \r\nfor the principle of non-intervention.\r\nAs it has argued consistently in the past, Mexico \r\ntoday reiterates its call for an end to the commercial \r\nand financial blockade of Cuba. Mexico believes that \r\nsolutions to problems must be found through dialogue \r\nand negotiations. I am convinced that the end of the \r\nblockade would benefit the entire region.\r\nIn the international arena today, we have seen \r\ntrends that seemed to have been overcome and that in \r\nthe past were shown to run contrary to the interests \r\nof development, such as advocacy for exclusionary \r\nnationalisms, the return of protectionist trade practices \r\nand the questioning and erosion of multilateralism. Such \r\npolicies promote exclusion — the political exclusion of \r\nminorities, the social exclusion of vulnerable groups, \r\nthe economic exclusion of those less fortunate and the \r\ncultural exclusion of those who live or think differently.\r\nFaced with such worrying trends, I reaffirm before \r\nthis universal forum the importance of multilateralism \r\nand international cooperation for Mexico. Experience \r\nshows that multilateralism is the best way to defend \r\nthe sovereignty and dignity of every State, while at the \r\nsame time contributing to the security and well-being \r\nof the community of nations. For that reason, all the \r\nMembers of the Organization must confirm their trust \r\nin and commit themselves to strengthening it.\r\nSpecifically, Mexico calls on Member States, \r\nfirst, to achieve a consensus for the comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council that would strengthen \r\nmultilateralism, not create new permanent members \r\nand establish longer terms for non-permanent \r\nmembers; secondly, to ensure that the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, which constitutes a true \r\ninternational social charter for the twenty-first century, \r\nbecomes an effective global guide to ensure that no one \r\nis left behind; thirdly, to strengthen the human rights \r\nregime throughout the world — we are confident that \r\nthe appointment of Ms. Michelle Bachelet as United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights will \r\nstrengthen that important pillar of the Organization; \r\nand, fourthly, to comply fully with the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions to safeguard international \r\npeace and security. We are encouraged by the progress \r\nin the dialogue between the Republic of Korea and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. At the same \r\ntime, we reiterate the call for compliance with the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions on the complete \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\r\nMy country is currently undergoing a period \r\nof democratic transition between Governments. \r\nMarked by unconditional respect for the political and \r\neconomic freedoms of Mexico’s citizens, the change in \r\nAdministrations is taking place in an environment of \r\ncertainty, order, economic stability and social peace. \r\nAs I am just a few weeks from completing my term \r\nas President of Mexico, this will be my last statement \r\nin the largest forum of the international community. \r\nDuring the past six years, I have found that dialogue, \r\ncooperation and an international system based on rules \r\nare our best option to achieve just, shared and lasting \r\nsolutions to global challenges.\r\nBuilding a world of peace, friendship and \r\ninternational cooperation has never been an easy task. \r\nThere are those who opt for exclusion and discord. \r\nThere are also those who choose to be mere observers \r\ninstead of true agents of change. Those alternatives \r\nare contrary to the spirit of harmony and universal \r\nfraternity that inspires the members of the Assembly. \r\nThe Organization is the best indication that it is well \r\nworth fighting for a more peaceful, secure, inclusive, \r\negalitarian, developed and sustainable world. The \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 27/53\r\nchallenges facing the international community compel \r\nus to remain faithful to the ideals that inspired the \r\nfounding of the Organization and to continue building \r\non the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Let us all fulfil responsibly the commitments \r\nthat our States have assumed individually for the \r\nbenefit of every nation and, at the same time, of the \r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the United Mexican States for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of the United \r\nMexican States, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Emmanuel Macron, President of \r\nthe French Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe French Republic.\r\nMr. Emmanuel Macron, President of the \r\nFrench Republic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Emmanuel \r\nMacron, President of the French Republic, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Macron (spoke in French): All of us here \r\nare heirs to the great hope to save future generations \r\nfrom the scourge of war, to build an international \r\norder based on law and respect for one’s word, and to \r\nlead humankind towards economic, social and moral \r\nprogress in increasingly secure freedom. We have seen \r\nresults. The enjoyment of human rights has spread, \r\ntrade and prosperity have grown, and poverty has \r\ndeclined. That has been our achievement of the past \r\nseveral decades.\r\nWe must, however, look honestly at the moment in \r\nwhich we are living. We are experiencing today a deep \r\ncrisis in the liberal Westphalian international order, \r\nwhich we have known. First, that is because, in part, \r\nit has failed to regulate itself, and to date no solution \r\ncommensurate with the task of meeting its economic, \r\nfinancial, environmental and climatic failures has been \r\nfound. Secondly, it is because our collective capacity to \r\nrespond to crises too often continues to be hindered by \r\ndivisions within the Security Council. Our Organization \r\nis too often reduced to deploring the violations of rights \r\nthat it has pledged to guarantee. Seventy years after \r\nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights by the General Assembly in Paris, a cultural, \r\nhistorical and religious relativism is now challenging \r\nthe foundations of their universality.\r\nBorn of hope, the United Nations can become, like \r\nthe League of Nations that preceded it, the symbol \r\nof powerlessness. We need not look far to see who is \r\nresponsible for that crime. They are in this Assembly \r\nHall. They are speaking today. We, the leaders, are \r\nresponsible. On that basis, I see three main paths for \r\nus to follow.\r\nThe first path is to think that this is just a passing \r\nmoment, a historical parenthesis before we return to \r\nlife as normal. I do not believe that to be the case. I do \r\nnot believe it because we are going through a crisis of \r\neffectiveness and principles in our contemporary world \r\norder, which will not be able to restore its previous \r\nlandmarks and modes of functioning. This moment in \r\ntime is not a parenthesis; it is a manifestation of our \r\nown failures of the past.\r\nThe second path would be that of the law of the \r\nstrongest. Everyone is tempted to follow their own law. \r\nThat path — the path of unilateralism — leads directly \r\nto isolation and conflict, to widespread clashes with \r\neveryone pitted against each other, to the detriment of \r\nall, even ultimately those who believe themselves to be \r\nthe strongest. The responsibility for peace cannot be \r\ndelegated; it cannot be refused; it cannot be pre-empted. \r\nIt must be exercised collectively.\r\nThe law of the strongest does not protect any people \r\nfrom any threat, be it chemical or nuclear. What will \r\ntruly resolve the situation in Iran and what has already \r\nbegun to stabilize it? Was it the law of the strongest, the \r\npressure of one individual? No. We know that Iran was \r\non the path to military nuclear power, but what stopped \r\nit was the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreed \r\nin Vienna in 2015. Today, as I said a year ago (see \r\nA/72/PV.4), we must not exacerbate regional tensions, \r\nbut rather put forth a broader agenda that addresses all \r\nthe nuclear, ballistic and regional concerns caused by \r\nIranian policies. We must do so through dialogue and \r\nmultilateralism, without naivety or complacency, but \r\nalso without posturing, which would be pointless.\r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n28/53 18-29769\r\nThe problem of trade imbalances and their \r\nconsequences for our societies will be solved by \r\ncommon rules adapted to today’s reality that make it \r\npossible to ensure fair competition on an equal footing, \r\nand under no circumstances will a bilateral approach to \r\nall our trade disputes or new protectionism do so.\r\nWhat will resolve the crisis between Israel and \r\nPalestine is definitely not unilateral initiatives, or \r\nignoring Palestinians’ legitimate right to lasting \r\npeace, or underestimating Israelis’ legitimate right to \r\ntheir security. There is no credible alternative to two \r\nStates living side by side in peace and security, with \r\nJerusalem as their capital. Israel knows that France is \r\nunwavering in its friendship, and it is in the name of \r\nthat friendship that I call for a quick end to the policy \r\nof faits accomplis that threaten the very possibility of \r\nreaching a peace agreement. Continuing along that \r\npath would be a mistake. On that issue, I am ready, and \r\nwe must all stand ready, to move beyond dogmas and \r\nhistorical positions in order to take new initiatives, on \r\nthe condition that it leads to positive changes on the \r\nground. There too, the law of the strongest will only \r\nexacerbate frustration and violence. As the Assembly \r\nhas seen, in the face of contemporary imbalances, I \r\ndo not believe in the law of the strongest, even if it is \r\nmasked in a form of legitimacy where it has actually \r\nlost all claims to legality.\r\nI believe that there is a third possible path ahead of \r\nus, probably the most difficult and the most demanding, \r\nwhich requires us to forge a new model and to find a \r\nnew global balance together. After the Second World \r\nWar, a balance was built bloc by bloc over the course \r\nof decades. Then there was the emergence of a model \r\nbased on hyperpower. For several years now, we have \r\nwitnessed a new global instability characterized by the \r\nreturn of multiple centres of power.\r\nThe new balance that we must create must be based \r\non new forms of regional and international cooperation \r\nand will, in my opinion, be structured around three \r\nprinciples. The first is respect for sovereignty, which is \r\nat the very heart of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThe second is the strengthening of our regional \r\ncooperation. The third is the provision of more robust \r\ninternational guarantees or safeguards. It is through \r\nthat method, and on the basis of those three principles, \r\nthat we must manage contemporary crisis situations.\r\nIn Syria, we are pursuing the fight against Islamist \r\nterrorism. The military engagements of some countries \r\nhave allowed the regime to recover at the expense of \r\ncrimes for which those responsible will one day have \r\nto account. The Syrian people have, tragically, paid \r\nthe price, and there will be no winners in a Syria in \r\nruins. What is needed now is to win peace under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations. We cannot decide for \r\nthe Syrian people, but we must rather build the ways \r\nand means of the method that I have just defined and \r\nthereby build a solution supported not only by the \r\nAstana guarantors, but also by other States of the \r\nregion and the international community through the \r\nSmall Group on Syria, under the coordination of the \r\nUnited Nations and the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General, in order to create the means both to \r\nresolve the humanitarian crisis and to build an inclusive, \r\nlasting political solution through constitutional reform \r\nand the holding of free elections. That is what it means \r\nto truly respect Syrian sovereignty. It is neither a \r\nsubstitute for the Syrian people in deciding who should \r\nbe their leader nor an agreement to cover all crimes by \r\naccepting that this leader will remain until the end of \r\ntime, considering that all principles and, ultimately, all \r\nlaw have been cast aside.\r\nIn Libya, too, it is that new method that should \r\nenable us to achieve a lasting solution. The current \r\nstatus quo allows militias and traffickers to gain \r\nground, which destabilizes the entire region. We will \r\nnot give the Libyans a way out of the crisis if we remain \r\ndivided and if Libya becomes a stage, as it still is too \r\noften, for confrontations among foreign influences. \r\nIn Paris, the Libyans recently pledged to hold early \r\nelections, which will make it possible to reunify State \r\ninstitutions. Those commitments must be fulfilled \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations and in close \r\ncooperation with the African Union. Yesterday, an \r\nimportant step was taken that I wish to commend \r\nhere. It is in the interests of Libyans, their neighbours, \r\nEuropeans and the international community, who must \r\nbe united around those objectives to move forward in \r\nthat way.\r\nWe are all strong together in the face of terrorism \r\nwhen States are able to count on their own forces to \r\nensure their security and when such security is based \r\non regional and international solutions, in accordance \r\nwith the principle I have justset out. That is the decision \r\ntaken by the States of the Sahel, acting together in the \r\nJoint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel. That was \r\nalso the essence of the process launched by the African \r\nUnion to better assume its responsibilities by deploying \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 29/53\r\nAfrican peacekeeping operations. That is the essence \r\nof the initiatives undertaken in the Lake Chad region, \r\ntogether with Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon, with the \r\nsupport of the African Union. That is why we must \r\nsupport the African Union’s initiative and push for \r\nbetter coordination between the African Union and the \r\nUnited Nations. I hope that, by the end of the year, a \r\nresolution can be adopted to that effect.\r\nWe are strong in the face of terrorism when we take \r\njoint responsibility to fight all its forms of financing, \r\nand when, as we do in the Alliance for the Sahel, we act \r\ntogether for development, agriculture and education, \r\nand against the root causes of despair that have allowed \r\nterrorists to win hearts and minds. Some $7.5 billion \r\nhas already been committed to 500 projects defined \r\njointly with all the States concerned and the partners of \r\nthe Alliance for the Sahel. We must consolidate those \r\ninitial results.\r\nAs is evident from each of these crises, the answer \r\nhas not been to leave States alone, to act for them or to \r\nproclaim from here the law or solution to be applied, but \r\nto know how to conscientiously articulate the principles \r\nof the sovereignty of peoples, regional cooperation and \r\nthe real commitment of the international community. \r\nThose three principles form the basis for modern \r\nsolutions. Only collective action can preserve the \r\nsovereignty and equality of the peoples that have given \r\nus a mandate. We also need collective action in the \r\nface of the demographic, climate and digital challenges \r\nbefore us, which none of us can face alone.\r\nConfronted with the great challenges posed by \r\nmigration, I do not believe in talk of unconditional \r\nopenness, which only sparks concern and stokes \r\nintolerance. Nor do I believe in the misleading speeches \r\nof those who claim, for example, in Europe as elsewhere, \r\nthat they will be safer behind the protection of a closed \r\nborder. That is not true. The only effective way to \r\nmanage the migratory f lows affecting all our continents \r\nin an organized and controlled manner is to create the \r\nconditions for elective rather than forced international \r\nmobility, to work together — countries of origin, \r\ntransit and destination — to address the root causes \r\nof migration, especially for its victims, to dismantle \r\ntrafficking networks that are the worst scourge of this \r\nphenomenon, and to protect our borders in a respectful \r\nmanner while ensuring compliance with international \r\nlaw and, in particular, the unconditional protection of \r\nthose who are entitled to asylum. That is what we have \r\ndecided to do together through the United Nations pact \r\nthat is to be adopted in Marrakech in December, which \r\nI support.\r\nWith regard to climate change, too, there are no \r\nfree rides or easy solutions either. Even those who have \r\nchallenged that reality suffer its consequences like \r\neveryone else. Extreme weather events are now a daily \r\noccurrence. And by weakening collective action, some \r\nonly expose themselves further.\r\nAs for the great digital transformation, here too \r\nour duty is to stand together to build modern rules that \r\nwill allow us to reconcile the development of artificial \r\nintelligence with our ethical rules in order to support \r\nthe digital transformation of our societies.\r\nI firmly believe in the sovereignty of peoples, \r\nwhich today is strong and demanded by all our peoples \r\nin the international arena. It also enjoys enhanced \r\ncooperation in many forms and a renewed legitimacy \r\nof international commitment. The great fight of our \r\nelders was achieving peace, and this remains one of our \r\nresponsibilities. We will win that fight in the twenty-\r\nfirst century only by restoring a robust multilateralism \r\nthat is truly capable not only of resolving conflicts \r\npragmatically but, also and more broadly, of addressing \r\ntheir causes.\r\nTo tell the truth, I do not believe in one great \r\nglobalized people. That is an illusion. It does not exist. \r\nBut I do believe in universal values, and on that point \r\nwe must not compromise. It is not the same thing. I \r\nbelieve in the non-negotiable defence of our values: \r\nhuman rights, the dignity of individuals and gender \r\nequality. I believe in our ability to strike a balance that \r\nrespects peoples and cultures by refusing to negotiate \r\nthose universal values. That is the reality, and I will in \r\nno way leave the principle of the sovereignty of peoples \r\nin the hands of nationalists or those who today, before \r\nthe international community, advocate withdrawal and \r\nwish to exploit the sovereignty of peoples to challenge \r\nthe universality and strength of our values, thanks to \r\nwhich we are all gathered here together in this Hall.\r\nAll of us here, even those who criticize it, have \r\nbenefited from the structuring of the international \r\norder that has accompanied globalization. We have \r\nenjoyed a period of humanism and have all played a \r\nrole in making it happen. Today, we must tackle the \r\nroot causes of our imbalances. Together, we must face \r\nthe weaknesses of our international order and, beyond \r\nthe crises I have just mentioned, consider the deep \r\ninequalities that have taken root. In my view, that is the \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n30/53 18-29769\r\nheart of our problem today. What awakens nationalism? \r\nWhat gives rise to doubt in our Assembly? What gives \r\nrise crises everywhere? It is those deep inequalities that \r\nwe have failed to address.\r\nTen years ago, when the international financial \r\ncrisis hit, we took emergency action, but we did not \r\nsolve the root cause. We did not curb the trend of \r\nhyperconcentration of wealth on our planet, and we did \r\nnot truly provide a response to all those left behind by \r\nglobalization. All those who were marginalized now \r\nhold a grudge because of the humiliations they suffered \r\nor have been plunged into despair, for which we are \r\nnow collectively paying the price. We owe all those \r\npeople a response.\r\nWe owe a response to the 265 million children who \r\ndo not have access to school, more than half of whom \r\nlive in sub-Saharan Africa, and to the young girls who \r\nhave equal access to education in less than 40 per cent \r\nof countries.\r\nWe owe a response to the 700 million children who \r\nlive in the regions most exposed to the consequences \r\nof climate change — the victims of f loods, droughts, \r\nrising sea levels and the depletion of resources.\r\nWe owe a response to the 200 million women who \r\ndo not have access to contraception, to the more than \r\n1 billion women who are not protected by law if they \r\nare victims of violence in their homes, and to all women \r\nwhose global average pay is 23 per cent less than men \r\nand up to 40 per cent in rural areas.\r\nWe owe a response to the 783 million people living \r\nbelow the poverty line, to those suffering from hunger \r\nor chronic malnutrition and to those who do not have \r\naccess to basic health care.\r\nWe owe a response to the aspirations of the most \r\nimportant generation of young people in history — our \r\nown young people — amounting to nearly 2 billion \r\npeople who are now between the ages of 10 and 24, and \r\n90 per cent of whom live in developing countries.\r\nWe owe a response to all those who look to us \r\nbecause their destiny depends on what we are or are \r\nnot able to do here together in the Assembly. And \r\nthose who forget that we owe an answer to all those \r\npeople are wrong because they are sowing the seeds \r\nfor tomorrow’s crises and because they will leave their \r\nchildren and ours in a much worse situation than we are \r\nin today.\r\nWe have made great progress in reducing \r\ninequalities among our countries, and we have \r\ncreated the framework for that in the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, but the fight is not \r\nbehind us. It is far from over. Wealth per capita is 50 \r\ntimes higher in the countries of the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development than in low-\r\nincome countries. Do we think that we can sustainably \r\nincrease stability and balance in this state of affairs? \r\nNo, we must take action. That is why, as I announced \r\nhere last year (see A/72/PV.4), I have decided to \r\nincrease France’s official development assistance by \r\n€1 billion starting in 2019. Our humanitarian funding \r\nwill increase by 40 per cent. But it is also why the fight \r\nagainst inequality will be the priority of the French \r\npresidency of the Group of Seven (G-7) summit in 2019. \r\nAfter Canada, whose leadership I applaud, France will \r\nassume the G-7’s next presidency. I would like to have a \r\nmajor reconsideration of its format in order to improve \r\nits association with various other Powers and devise \r\nnew ways to coordinate.\r\nI also wanted it to be at the United Nations that I made \r\nthe first announcement that the inequality agenda will \r\nbe at the centre of the next G-7, and also that I intend to \r\nreport on the results of the Biarritz G-7 next September, \r\nbecause the time when a club of rich countries could \r\ndefine the balances of power in the world by itself \r\nhas long since passed and because it is impossible to \r\nseparate the fate of each of its members from that of all \r\nthe States members of the Assembly. We must tackle \r\nmodern inequalities today because they are at the root \r\nof the evil that I denounced at the beginning of my \r\nstatement. We must address inequalities of opportunity, \r\nwhich are a moral aberration and an unsustainable \r\nreality. We cannot accept a world in which people do \r\nnot have the same opportunities because of the country \r\nwhere they were born, or cannot go to school in certain \r\ncountries because they are women, or do not have \r\naccess to basic services.\r\nWe kept the commitment made here last year with \r\nthe President of Senegal. The Global Partnership for \r\nEducation Financing Conference, held in February in \r\nDakar, raised $2.5 billion to increase access to education \r\naround the world. That is a historic amount. France has \r\nincreased its contribution tenfold. The mobilization of \r\nthe G-7 already begun under the Canadian presidency \r\nshould make it possible to go even further. We are at \r\na key moment on this issue that will decide whether \r\nor not we are capable of dealing with the challenge we \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 31/53\r\nface. Between now and 2030 there will be 620 million \r\nmore children needing schooling worldwide, including \r\n444 million Africans. Are we going to provide for that? \r\nAre we going to give them all that they need for a solid \r\nfoundation that will enable them to be agents for their \r\nown lives, to live as brothers in tomorrow’s world? If \r\nnot, what kind of world are we creating? That is why I \r\nhave committed France to this fight and why I insist so \r\nmuch on teacher training, vocational training and gender \r\nequality in education. That is why I urge everyone \r\nhere to join in this great global surge for education. \r\nEducation and health will not only be the pillars of our \r\nsocieties in the twenty-first century, they will be the \r\nfundamental building blocks of our economies.\r\nWe must also fight diligently against gender \r\ninequality. In France I have made this the signature \r\nissue of my five-year term, and I am launching an \r\nappeal here to make it a major global issue. Women \r\nand girls are the first of us to be affected by poverty, \r\nconflict and the consequences of global warming. They \r\nare the primary victims of gender-based and sexual \r\nviolence, which too often hinders their freedom of \r\nmovement and their ability to work and have control \r\nover their bodies. It is our responsibility in the twenty-\r\nfirst century to put an end to such violence, from street \r\nharassment to femicide. It is time for our world to stop \r\nvictimizing women and finally make a place for them, \r\none that they deserve, one where they can be leaders. \r\nWe must ensure that they have access to education, \r\nhealth care, employment and economic and political \r\ndecision-making everywhere, and we must fight all \r\nforms of violence against them. France therefore \r\nproposes to those Governments that want to move \r\nforward with us the creation of a coalition for enacting \r\nnew legislation on equality between women and men. \r\nFifty per cent of our development assistance will be \r\ndevoted to projects aimed at reducing gender inequality.\r\nWe must also mobilize against health inequality at \r\nthe international level. In Lyon in 2019 we will host \r\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria Replenishment Conference. We will take up \r\nthe initiative on the fight against counterfeit medicines \r\nand will intensify our response to major pandemics. I \r\ncall on everyone here to mobilize.\r\nLastly, we must fight urgently, body and soul, \r\nagainst environmental inequality. It is unacceptable that \r\n45 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions are produced by \r\n10 per cent of the planet’s richest inhabitants. As is the \r\ncase with solar energy, we have an inefficient situation \r\nwhen the countries with the greatest potential and \r\nneeds have the least access to appropriate technologies. \r\nIt is unsustainable that 100 million more people will \r\nbe condemned to extreme poverty by 2030 if we fail \r\nto meet our commitments to fighting global warming. \r\nHere too we must be united in combat. Some countries \r\nrepresented here are suffering more than others, and \r\nwe owe them our solidarity. But we will all be held \r\naccountable for the disasters that are multiplying before \r\nour very eyes, before our peoples and our own children. \r\nThe proclaimed breakdown of the Paris Climate \r\nChange Agreement has been thwarted because we have \r\nbeen able to remain united, despite the decision of the \r\nUnited States to withdraw from it. That strength must \r\ncontinue to support us and help us to ward off all the \r\nfatalistic predictions.\r\nWe are told that solutions exist but that the funding \r\nis lacking. So let us go find it, let us innovate. This is \r\nwhat we did last year in Paris, on 12 December, with \r\nmany of those gathered here, at the One Planet Summit, \r\nwith concrete commitments and first results. That is \r\nwhat we did at the beginning of the year in Delhi, with \r\nthe International Solar Alliance. That is what we will do \r\nagain tomorrow in New York, at the second One Planet \r\nSummit. We are told that it is already too late, that we \r\ncannot meet the goals. So let us speed up, let us together \r\nadopt the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement \r\nin December at the 24th session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change. Let us implement the protocol against \r\nhydrofluorocarbon gases, which could enable us to \r\nreduce the average global temperature by one degree \r\nby 2050. Let us set ourselves the goal of concluding an \r\nambitious draft global environmental pact by 2020, and \r\nensuring that the Beijing Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity and the 2020 \r\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature World \r\nConservation Congress in France will be decisive steps.\r\nLet us make a clear commitment, and let us all \r\nbe equally clear, concrete and consistent. This is an \r\nemergency. So let us honour the commitments we \r\nhave made. Let us no longer sign trade agreements \r\nwith Powers that do not respect the Paris Agreement. \r\nLet us ensure that our business commitments integrate \r\nour environmental and social constraints. Let us work \r\nharder to involve sovereign wealth funds and financiers \r\nin this low-carbon-policy strategy. France will continue \r\nto be a global leader in this fight alongside everyone \r\nwho wants to join. We will work in the G-7 to ensure \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n32/53 18-29769\r\nthat the commitments made at the 2015 Climate Change \r\nConference are increased, and if one of our members \r\ndoes not want to move forward, we will move forward \r\nanyway by seeking new coalitions and new formats, \r\nbecause the G-7’s mission is to remain a united group \r\nof countries committed to democracy. But today it \r\nmust also contribute to the creation of new coalitions \r\nthat will make it possible to improve and restructure \r\nthe collective global system. So let us build new forms \r\nof cooperation to make progress and take decisions \r\non those fundamental issues. Only together can we \r\neffectively fight the inequalities that have fractured all \r\nof our societies and that have fuelled mistrust and the \r\ntemptation to withdraw — inequalities that we have \r\nallowed to grow and to which we have been collectively \r\nunable to respond effectively.\r\nBut none of us can effectively fight the inequalities \r\nI have decried if we act alone. If we do, there are \r\nessentially only two solutions. The first is to continually \r\nlower the bar and revert to the standards that we know, \r\nas we have been doing for decades. We have a trade war, \r\nso let us reduce workers’ rights, keep cutting taxes and \r\nfuel our inequalities that way in an effort to respond to \r\nour trade problems. What does that lead to? It reinforces \r\nthe inequalities in our societies and the disruption that \r\nwe are living through. The alternative is to say that it \r\nis the rules that are not working, so we should retreat \r\ninwards towards isolationism and protectionism. But \r\nthe only thing that leads to is heightened tensions, \r\nwhich do nothing to address serious inequalities.\r\nWhat I am proposing instead is that we put in place \r\na collective mechanism to enable us to work together \r\non what we are doing in each of our countries to reduce \r\ninequalities, to evaluate our actions but also to coordinate \r\nthem better and to disseminate best practices. I therefore \r\npropose that international institutions — the United \r\nNations, but the OECD as well, of course — support us \r\nin setting up such a mechanism, for which the G-7 must \r\nbe the driving force.\r\nTo defeat inequality, we must change our methods. \r\nFirst, we should revise both our trade and social rules. \r\nRather than pursuing protectionism, we should all \r\nwork together to thoroughly review the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) rules. We must restore the WTO’s \r\nability to resolve conflicts and establish rules for the \r\nunfair trade practices, non-compliance with intellectual \r\nproperty rights and forced technology transfers that \r\nmake a level playing field impossible. Starting this year, \r\nthe Group of Twenty summit in Argentina must provide \r\nus with a credible road map for rebuilding the WTO. \r\nThat is also what we will have to do on the social front \r\nnext year, during the centenary of the International \r\nLabour Organization.\r\nSecondly, we must also change the modalities of \r\nour action, bringing into the scope of our collective \r\naction the major players who are not in this Hall or \r\nat the General Assembly, the big non-State actors \r\nwho are helping to change the world but who do not \r\nparticipate enough in reducing the inequalities that \r\nthese transformations bring, and by that I mean the \r\nmajor digital players, both in terms of taxation and \r\nof responsibility for combating the manipulation of \r\ninformation. We need to operate differently from \r\nour standard collective action where all our major \r\nchallenges are concerned and include dialogue with \r\nthese new private stakeholders and Internet giants.\r\nThirdly, we must enable Africa to take its rightful \r\nplace so that it can play a central part in rebuilding the \r\ninternational system. It is not only on that continent that \r\nwe will collectively win or lose our great battle against \r\ninequality — it is with that continent, because today it \r\nis in Africa that we find the most fervent defenders of \r\nmultilateralism and regional integration. Our African \r\npartners have fully understood that we can only meet \r\nour common challenges together. And this new alliance \r\nwith Africa will also be a focus of the French presidency \r\nof the G-7.\r\nI firmly believe that despite these fractures \r\nand challenges in the modern world order, we can \r\nput together a new vocabulary for action while also \r\naddressing the root causes of inequality today. And it is \r\nthe responsibility of France and all its European partners, \r\nof the European Union, to be in the vanguard in this \r\nfight, to build a new, modern humanism that refuses to \r\nyield to attempts to withdraw or to simple-mindedness \r\nand at the same time, as mediating Powers, to build \r\nthese new rules for the international order.\r\nAt a time when our collective system is cracking, \r\nI have to say that we have never needed it so much. \r\nThat is why we will support the agencies working on \r\nprojects for peace and humanity — UNESCO, the \r\nconscience of the United Nations; the Human Rights \r\nCouncil; the International Criminal Court; the United \r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East, to which we will increase \r\nour contribution — because, I want to remind the \r\nAssembly, we are simply talking about enabling \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 33/53\r\nhundreds of thousands of children to go to school, \r\nnothing less, nothing more.\r\nWe will defend expanding both member categories \r\nof the Security Council so that its composition reflects \r\ntoday’s balances of power and so that it is strengthened \r\nas a forum for consultation rather than obstruction. We \r\nwill ensure that by the end of the year, two thirds of the \r\nmembers of the General Assembly can support limiting \r\nthe right of veto in the case of mass atrocities. We will \r\ndefend international humanitarian law by supporting \r\nstaff who take extraordinary risks to help civilians on \r\nthe ground by negotiating humanitarian access to all \r\ntheatres, one by one.\r\nOn the seventieth anniversary of the 1948 Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, we will remind the \r\nworld that human rights are not a cultural thing. They \r\nare not simply values or revocable options, but a legal \r\ncorpus enshrined in international treaties to which the \r\nmembers of the Assembly have freely consented. We \r\nwill point out that their universality not only does not \r\nrun counter to a people’s sovereignty, it is rather the \r\nonly way to ensure the preservation and exercise of \r\nthose rights.\r\nFrance will be there to ensure that the world does \r\nnot forget that clashing nationalisms only plunge us \r\ninto the abyss, that when democracies lack the courage \r\nto defend their principles, they are weak, and that \r\naccumulated resentments, backed only by a fragile \r\ninternational system, can result in a global unleashing \r\nof violence twice in the space of one human life. I am \r\nspeaking from our own experience. In a few weeks’ time, \r\non 11 November, the Paris Peace Forum will present \r\nan opportunity for us to see a surge of thoughtfulness \r\nand courage as we attempt to rediscover what keeps \r\nus together here. For us, united by the tragedies of the \r\ntwentieth century, it should be a time for renewal and \r\nto rediscover the oath we have taken to save future \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war. I want us and our \r\ncounterparts to take on new responsibilities during the \r\nForum in order to chart the way for concrete actions in \r\nthe service of peace.\r\nI know that many of us may be tired of multilateralism. \r\nIn a world that is f looded with information and in \r\nwhich in a sense we are in a free-for-all, in which \r\nsociety is a reality show where it is fashionable and \r\nnewsworthy to say the worst possible things, I know \r\nthat denouncing the consequences of causes we have \r\nchampioned can be a successful political tactic and \r\nthat defending cooperation and multilateralism may no \r\nlonger be fashionable. Then let us not be fashionable, \r\nbecause we have a duty to those who have made it \r\npossible for us to sit in this Hall. Because we must \r\nnever forget that the genocides that are the reason we \r\nare here today were fuelled by the speeches that we are \r\ngrowing accustomed to, by the political spectacles that \r\nwe applaud. Because we are now seeing international \r\nlaw and every kind of cooperation disintegrate, as if it \r\nwas nothing, out of fear and complicity and because it \r\nlooks good.\r\nBut I will not do that. I will not do it, because I come \r\nfrom a country that helped to create the declarations that \r\nhave brought us here, because I come from a country \r\nthat stands tall, and while it has made many mistakes \r\nand done many bad things, it has been able to maintain \r\na kind of universalism at every point in its own history \r\nand in international history. This is today. This is now. \r\nSo we must not get used to it. We must not accept all \r\nthese kinds of unilateralism. Every day pages are being \r\nripped in a betrayal of our history. And I am not going \r\nto get used to it.\r\nThis is what I have to say, very clearly. This \r\nnascent century is watching us, and our children are \r\nwaiting. We must resolve our crises. We must work \r\ntogether to combat all our inequalities, but let us do so \r\non a human level and in full accord with our principles, \r\nour histories and our universalism. In any case, that is \r\nmy commitment to everyone here, and I am counting \r\non us all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe French Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Emmanuel Macron, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Danny Faure, President of the \r\nRepublic of Seychelles\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Seychelles.\r\nMr. Danny Faure, President of the Republic \r\nof Seychelles, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n34/53 18-29769\r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Danny Faure, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Seychelles, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Faure: Let me start by paying tribute to \r\nthe statesmen and giants of history who have walked \r\nthese halls and without whom our Organization would \r\nnot be what it is today, a symbol of unity and cooperation \r\nfor all the nations in the world. As we celebrate the \r\nanniversary of this great Organization, let us pause \r\nand reflect on the true purpose that lies at the heart of \r\nthe United Nations. We must renew our commitment \r\nnot only to the Charter of the United Nations, but to its \r\nfounding principles, which must always guide us in our \r\ndeliberations and actions. Those cooperative values are \r\ncritical to the continued peace and prosperity of all our \r\nnations and peoples. We cannot let them come under \r\nthreat. As a collective, we must continue to embrace \r\nmultilateralism, which has underpinned the values of \r\nour Organization for nearly three quarters of a century.\r\nSeychelles continues to embrace the multilateral \r\nsystem that is the United Nations, and we fully support \r\nthe evolution and progress that will come out of United \r\nNations reform. Those reforms stress the need for a \r\nmore coordinated approach among the United Nations \r\ncountry teams in order to successfully deliver the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and related \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We consider \r\nmultilateral cooperation to be of the utmost importance, \r\nand in that spirit, on 30 August the Government of \r\nSeychelles and its United Nations country team signed \r\ntheir first strategic partnership framework for the period \r\nfrom 2019 to 2023, defining the collective support of 18 \r\nUnited Nations agencies. The challenges that we face \r\nin the international system remain a vivid reminder of \r\nan evolving world to which we must adapt if we are to \r\nsecure lasting peace and prosperity. Without targeted \r\napproaches that touch the lives of our most vulnerable \r\npeoples and without fully embracing the promise of the \r\nSDGs, we run the risk of leaving some behind.\r\nStrong institutions are essential to a vibrant \r\ndemocracy in which there is transparency and \r\naccountability to the people. My mandate as President \r\nof Seychelles has in part been highlighted by my desire \r\nto ensure that our institutions not only serve the people \r\nbut grant them the necessary recourse should they \r\nfeel the need. Only by strengthening our institutions \r\nand binding ourselves to international law and norms \r\ncan our peoples truly have accountable Governments. \r\nToday I call on the advanced economies to support the \r\nstrengthening of institutions in developing nations, not \r\nthrough handouts, but by sharing expertise and best \r\npractices for the benefit of all. Only by strengthening \r\ninstitutions can we ensure respect for human rights, \r\nthe rule of law and independent judiciaries, which in \r\nturn will ensure that the future can favour a vibrant \r\ndemocratic order.\r\nSpeaking from the standpoint of an islander, I cannot \r\ndissociate the concept of lasting peace and prosperity \r\nfrom the perils of climate change. Climate change has \r\nbecome an existential threat not merely to the lives of \r\npeople in island States but to the world as a whole. As \r\nislanders, we live that stark reality every day. We see \r\nits effects in our eroding coastlines and unpredictable \r\nweather patterns, on our coral reefs and rising sea levels. \r\nWhile I recognize the need for development as a driving \r\nforce to lift our people out of poverty, we must remain \r\naware of its consequences for our planet and our future. \r\nThrough our neglect, we risk our children inheriting a \r\nplanet that is beyond their capacity to repair. Should we \r\nnot uphold the commitments we have made — from the \r\nParis Climate Change Conference to the Conference \r\nof the twenty-third session of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change held in \r\nBonn last year under Fiji’s presidency — we will reach \r\nan inescapable crisis.\r\nI believe in the power of our collective efforts to \r\nshape a future of which we can all be proud. In that \r\ncontext, I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention \r\nto the theme of our seventy-third session, “Making the \r\nUnited Nations relevant to all people: global leadership \r\nand shared responsibility for peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies”. The words “sustainable \r\nsocieties” have particular resonance for small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS).\r\nFor our United Nations to be truly inclusive and \r\nkeep up with the challenges of an ever-changing world, \r\nSeychelles aligns itself firmly with the African Union \r\nposition calling for the long-overdue and comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council. That includes the \r\nequitable representation of Africa, whose countries \r\nmake up more than a quarter of the members of the \r\nUnited Nations, after all.\r\nSustainability has always been and will continue \r\nto be at the heart of my country’s development efforts. \r\nAs a nation, we have shown the world our commitment \r\nto that process. Seychelles, alongside its fellow small \r\nisland developing States, has been actively engaged in \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 35/53\r\nthat discourse in order to ensure that our concerns and \r\nneeds are adequately addressed. Our nation was forged \r\nby the ocean. We are acutely aware of the challenges that \r\nposes with the threat of climate change. However, the \r\nocean also presents a myriad untapped opportunities. \r\nAt the beginning of this year, my country, Seychelles, \r\npioneered a blue economy strategic policy framework \r\nand road map, to multiply the economic potential \r\nof our territorial waters while also protecting them \r\nfor generations to come. For us, the blue economy is \r\nthe next frontier of development. It is about ocean-\r\nbased sustainable development focusing on economic \r\ndiversification, shared prosperity, food security and \r\nhealthy and productive oceans. It is encouraging to \r\nnote that other like-minded States are developing that \r\nconcept, regardless of their geography.\r\nSeychelles is slowly shifting from a dependence on \r\nbilateral aid donors to developing innovative sources of \r\nfinancing for our emerging blue economy. We are trying \r\nto leverage the wealth of the ocean that surrounds us \r\nand engage in exciting new partnerships. Nevertheless, \r\nwe recognize that will not be enough to meet all our \r\nsustainable-development and climate-action obligations \r\nunder the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the \r\nParis Agreement and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities \r\nof Action Pathway. That is why Seychelles is one of \r\nthose small island developing States that continues to \r\nadvocate for a SIDS-specific resilience index, which \r\nwould take into account the unique vulnerabilities \r\nand specificities of small island developing States and \r\nbetter reflect the realities that we face. The agenda of \r\nsmall island developing States is inextricably linked to \r\nthat of humankind.\r\nThe United Nations was born of the horrors of a \r\ndestructive world war. It was charged with upholding \r\nthe idea that as a collective, we could resolve our \r\ndifferences through dialogue and international \r\ndiplomacy. Together, we continue to demonstrate the \r\nsuccess and unrelenting power of diplomacy and, in the \r\ncase of smaller States like ours, we have also proved \r\nthat might is not right. In this unique forum, we have \r\nequal representation. Seychelles remains committed \r\nto the ideals of the United Nations and will remain an \r\nactive voice within this Organization. Today we are \r\nbeing presented with a unique opportunity to transform \r\nour world through our collective efforts and to create \r\nlasting partnerships. We have a unique opportunity to \r\nsculpt a future for our children that they can be proud to \r\ninherit. Let us be on the right side of history and live up \r\nto the ideals out of which this Organization was born.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Seychelles for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Danny Faure, President of the Republic \r\nof Seychelles, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Martín Vizcarra Cornejo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Peru.\r\nMr. Martín Vizcarra Cornejo, President of the \r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Martín \r\nVizcarra Cornejo, President of the Republic of Peru, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vizcarra Cornejo (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, I want to welcome Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés, who is assuming the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, \r\nand to wish her a successful mandate. I am sure that \r\nher role will promote the multilateral system. She has \r\nPeru’s support.\r\nI assumed the presidency of Peru just six months \r\nago, when my country was facing a serious political and \r\ninstitutional crisis that we dealt with by ensuring full \r\nrespect for the provisions of our political Constitution, \r\nwhich made it possible to restore the democratic \r\nstability that my country had been longing for. A \r\nfew days after my term began, we had the honour of \r\nwelcoming the leaders of 30 countries to the eighth \r\nSummit of the Americas, which resulted in the signing \r\nof the Lima Commitment to democratic governance \r\nagainst corruption. The agreement consists of 57 \r\nspecific measures and actions to strengthen the fight \r\nagainst corruption and regional cooperation in that \r\nfight, including increasing transparency, accountability \r\nand political parties’ use of banks in their election \r\ncampaigns, as well as a call to the countries in our \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n36/53 18-29769\r\nhemisphere to consider restricting access to public \r\noffice for people convicted of corruption.\r\nWe are aware that corruption affects democratic \r\ngovernance and the rule of law. Nothing can be built on \r\nthe basis of entities immersed in corruption. One of the \r\nfirst decisions that my Government took was therefore \r\nto establish an overall policy for the Government \r\npolicy through 2021. Its main thrusts are integrity and \r\nthe fight against corruption, as well as strengthening \r\ngovernance institutions. Within that framework, we \r\nhave approved a 2018-2021 national plan for integrity \r\nand combating corruption. In addition, two months \r\nago we submitted to the legislature a series of bills \r\naimed at legal and political reform that also involve \r\nconstitutional reforms, in which a few days ago our \r\nCongress expressed its confidence and its commitment \r\nto submitting for a referendum to be held on 9 December, \r\ninvolving the participation and decision-making of the \r\nentire citizenry through its vote.\r\nI am pleased to announce that Peru is making \r\nprogress towards its long-awaited political reforms \r\nand justice-system reforms through constitutional and \r\nparticipatory mechanisms that honour our commitments \r\nmade at the Summit of the Americas in Lima. We \r\nbelieve that only joint efforts by the State authorities, \r\nalong with transparency, accountability and citizens’ \r\nparticipation can enable us to build the country we \r\ndeserve. In that context, I would like to announce that \r\nPeru will promote the adoption of a draft resolution \r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations Convention \r\nagainst Corruption and its Conference of States Parties, \r\naimed at strengthening the cooperation needed to \r\ncombat that scourge, especially large-scale corruption \r\nand its transnational reach. We also want to promote a \r\ndecisive effort by the Assembly aimed at encouraging \r\nall States to renew their political commitment to fight \r\ncorruption and to explore new and more effective ways \r\nof combating it. Every year corruption diverts 5 per \r\ncent of the world’s gross domestic product to enrich the \r\nfew rather than directing those resources to effectively \r\nmeeting the Sustainable Development Goals for the \r\nbenefit of those who need it most.\r\nWith regard to climate change, it is clear that Peru \r\nis one of the world’s most vulnerable countries in terms \r\nof climate change. Our people’s primary natural asset \r\nis our great biodiversity, and changes in temperature \r\nand extreme climatic events such as droughts and \r\nheavy rains therefore make us particularly vulnerable. \r\nAs a country we have worked hard to create a legal \r\nframework that ensures predictability for investments \r\nwith high environmental and social standards through \r\na focus on production, protection and inclusion. In \r\norder to combat climate change, we have to overcome \r\npoverty. We need responsible investments to continue \r\ngrowing because the poorest of our people are the most \r\nvulnerable to the effects of climate change.\r\nI had the privilege, in one of my Government’s first \r\nactions, to see a climate change framework law enacted \r\nwith the aim of reducing our vulnerability to climate \r\nchange and taking advantage of opportunities for growth \r\nthrough low-emission development. Furthermore, we \r\nare one of the few countries that has an action plan for \r\nboth gender and climate change, because women are \r\nthe most vulnerable of all. I would also like to point \r\nout that we all have a moral obligation to protect our \r\nplanet for future generations and guarantee our citizens \r\nthe right to a healthy environment. That is both my \r\npersonal belief and a State policy, so I can assure the \r\nAssembly that Peru will continue to promote action \r\nat the national and international levels to effectively \r\ncombat climate change.\r\nAs we work to achieve the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich have already been incorporated into our national \r\ndevelopment plans, our primary responsibility is to \r\nachieve them with political determination and courage \r\nthrough the involvement of citizens and the private \r\nsector. We will also pay special attention to combating \r\nviolence and discrimination against women. Our \r\nobjective is to overcome the structural inequalities that \r\nwomen and girls suffer from in Peru, to guarantee their \r\nhuman rights and empower them to achieve their full \r\ndevelopment potential.\r\nIn an international context in which nationalist \r\ndiscourses promoting economic and commercial \r\nprotectionism, discrimination and xenophobia are \r\nre-emerging, I believe it is necessary to reaffirm Peru’s \r\ncommitment to multilateralism and to the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nAs a member of the Security Council, Peru reaffirms \r\nits willingness to contribute to international peace and \r\nsecurity, particularly through its active participation in \r\npeacekeeping operations. In that important body, we \r\nwill continue to advocate for harmonious work based \r\non international law and international humanitarian \r\nlaw. For a developing country like Peru, the United \r\nNations represents a platform for shared action to \r\nachieve sustainable development, promote human rights \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 37/53\r\nand address global challenges such as climate change, \r\nterrorism, the proliferation of weapons, systematic \r\ncorruption and illicit drug trafficking.\r\nI would like to express my country’s commitment \r\nto free trade, which has enabled us to generate wealth, \r\nreduce poverty and make progress on sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We recognize the important role played by \r\nthe World Trade Organization in ensuring the stability, \r\npredictability and transparency of the multilateral \r\ntrading system. I invite every country to make the \r\nsame commitment and to avoid protectionist measures, \r\nwhich, if implemented, will represent a setback both for \r\ndeveloped countries and for those of us in the process \r\nof development.\r\nWith regard to democracy and human rights in \r\nour region, I would like to reaffirm our democratic \r\norientation, which led us to head the process that resulted \r\nin the adoption of the Inter-American Democratic \r\nCharter in 2001. The Charter reflects the commitment of \r\nthe countries of the Americas to defending democracy, \r\nrespecting human rights and upholding fundamental \r\nfreedoms in the region. That commitment encourages \r\nus to seek ways to help to re-establish the democratic \r\norder where necessary. That is why Peru condemns \r\nthe breakdown of constitutional order in Venezuela. \r\nWe will continue to promote initiatives to help restore \r\ndemocracy in our sister country within the framework \r\nof the Organization of American States, the Lima \r\nGroup and in other multilateral forums. We reiterate \r\nour concern about and condemnation of the serious \r\nhuman rights violations in Venezuela denounced by \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights and the Inter-American Commission on Human \r\nRights, which among other violations have reported \r\nextrajudicial killings. Peru has also filed a complaint \r\nwith the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court \r\nwith a view to punishing those responsible for the \r\ncrimes committed in Venezuela.\r\nMy country expresses its unwavering solidarity \r\nwith the Venezuelan people and calls for an urgent \r\nresponse to the serious humanitarian crisis in \r\nVenezuela, which has led to a f lood of migrants and \r\nrefugees throughout our region. My Government has \r\ntaken steps to help to regulate the influx of the more \r\nthan 450,000 Venezuelan migrants who have come to \r\nPeru in search of a decent future. However, the scope of \r\nthe exodus is unprecedented in our region and requires \r\na collective response from the international community.\r\nI conclude by expressing our confidence in the \r\npotential of multilateralism, international law and \r\nthe principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nin responding to the challenges before us, promoting \r\nsustainable peace and development and guaranteeing \r\nthe human rights of our citizens. Peru will continue \r\nto work constructively within the framework of the \r\nOrganization to achieve the goals of the founding \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Peru for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Martín Vizcarra Cornejo, President of the \r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Abdullah II ibn \r\nAl Hussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom \r\nof Jordan\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the King of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\r\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, King \r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Majesty King Abdullah II ibn \r\nAl Hussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nKing Abdullah: It is an honour to take part in the \r\ngeneral debate of the wonderful General Assembly \r\nonce again.\r\nThe United Nations was born from the ashes of \r\nthe Second World War, out of a deep desire to protect \r\nnew generations from suffering, destruction and want. \r\nToday, those hopes still face challenges. Peace and \r\nstability have met threats in every region, too many \r\npeople remain excluded from the promise of prosperity, \r\nand global terror continues to target all nations. Here \r\nin this Hall, I have called our current situation a third \r\nworld war.\r\nThose challenges do not make collective action \r\nand mutual respect less important; if anything, they \r\nmake our partnership even more important, because \r\nwhat is the alternative? A world without the peace and \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n38/53 18-29769\r\naccord we need to work together, trade together and \r\nexpand opportunity together? A world where crises are \r\nnot resolved, but magnified? A world where violence \r\nspreads and more refugees f lee, because we cannot \r\nwork together to help people stay safe and thrive?\r\nWe have a long way to go to deliver global \r\nopportunity and hope, but we cannot simply give up \r\nbecause the task is hard. All our countries benefit \r\nwhen we unite in common cause. I am compelled to \r\ntalk about this today, because of the critical role of \r\ncollective action in ending the serious crises in my \r\nregion, and especially the key crisis — the long denial \r\nof a Palestinian State.\r\nEvery United Nations resolution — whether from \r\nthe General Assembly or the Security Council — since \r\nthe beginning of the crisis recognizes the equal rights \r\nof the Palestinian people to a future of peace, dignity \r\nand hope. That is the heart of the two-State settlement \r\nand the only path to a comprehensive, lasting peace. \r\nOnly a two-State solution based on international law \r\nand the relevant United Nations resolutions can meet \r\nthe needs of both sides: an end to the conflict; a viable, \r\nindependent, sovereign Palestinian State on the 1967 \r\nborders with East Jerusalem as its capital; and a secure \r\nIsrael, fully part of its own region, recognized by Arab \r\nand Muslim States around the world.\r\nArab and Muslim countries are committed to a \r\ncomprehensive peace. The Arab Peace Initiative has \r\nbeen on offer for more than 16 years. Indeed, every \r\nmajor country in the world, the United Nations and the \r\nEuropean Union all have worked to help the parties \r\nreach a durable peace that can last. The United States \r\nAdministration has long been committed to peace and \r\nhas a leading role in our progress going forward.\r\nYes, we have a long way to go. But we cannot \r\ngive up because the task is hard, because what is the \r\nalternative? Can we afford to let one of the world’s most \r\nstrategic regions be tied to an endless cycle of violence \r\nin its midst? How long must Jerusalem, a city  holy to \r\nmore than half the world’s people, face dangers to its \r\nmulti-faith heritage and identity? How can we accept a \r\nstatus quo of continuing crises and bigotry? Palestinian \r\nfamilies have been displaced for generations, their \r\nchildren’s very identity denied, and Israeli families are \r\nliving in continuing national self-isolation, without the \r\nsecurity of peaceful relationships worldwide.\r\nWhat could possibly be the future of the single, \r\nbinational State that some propose, whose very \r\nfoundation is a rejection of the equality of its own \r\npeople? That is the ugly and undemocratic reality of \r\nthe one-State idea. It is by no means an alternative to \r\na two-State peace settlement. It is an abandonment \r\nof peace, a new way to go AWOL from the work of \r\nreconciliation and the opposite of what both sides need \r\nand have sought for so long.\r\nThere is no such thing as a unilateral agreement; \r\nit takes at least two parties to make an agreement. \r\nHelping the parties to achieve that agreement and work \r\ntogether to build a new future deserves the strong and \r\nsteady support of all our world. Our countries need to \r\npull together to get the peace process back on track. \r\nThat means utterly rejecting actions that jeopardize \r\nnegotiations, whether by illegal encroachments, land \r\nconfiscations or threats to the welfare of innocents, \r\nespecially children.\r\nWe need to support full funding of the United \r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees \r\nin the Near East (UNRWA) and other vital efforts to \r\nprotect families, keep communities stable and prepare \r\nyoung people for productive lives. It would be a terrible \r\nmistake to abandon youth to the forces of radicalization \r\nand despair. Such support is urgently needed to ensure \r\nthat UNRWA fulfils its role, in accordance with its \r\nUnited Nations mandate.\r\nAbove all, we need to safeguard the heritage and \r\npeace of Jerusalem, a city holy to billions of people \r\naround the world. The Hashemite custodianship of \r\nIslamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem is a duty \r\nthat Jordan is proud to carry, and we will counter \r\nany attempts to change the Holy City’s historic Arab, \r\nChristian and Muslim identity. But Jerusalem’s future \r\nis not Jordan’s concern alone; it is the concern of all \r\nMember States. There are global implications when \r\nreligious worship is threatened and international law \r\nis undermined.\r\nCollective action is also vital when it comes to \r\nresolving other conflicts and crises that threaten \r\nour world. Jordan will continue to support all multilateral \r\nefforts to help Syria achieve a political solution that \r\nis based on the Geneva process and Security Council \r\nresolution 2254 (2015), in order to safeguard the \r\ncountry’s unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nand to create the conditions for stability and rebuilding.\r\nAn effective global response to terror also requires \r\ncontinued collective action. Let us be clear about it: for \r\nall our victories, the fight against those outlaws, the \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 39/53\r\nkhawarij of Islam, is not over. Winning the war demands \r\na long-term, holistic approach — one that pairs security \r\nmeasures with strong initiatives that support inclusion \r\nand hope. Offline and online, we must counter all — I \r\nsay all — ideologies of hatred, including Islamophobia. \r\nJordanians have led efforts to unite the world in mutual \r\nrespect and understanding.\r\nFinally, we must also strengthen our collective \r\nresponse to the global refugee crisis. As many here \r\nknow, Jordan has carried a massive and disproportionate \r\nburden as a refugee host. Our people have opened their \r\nhomes, schools, public services and hospitals. We have \r\nshared our country’s scarce resources: our food, energy \r\nand precious water. The crisis has held back economic \r\ngrowth and job creation; jobs are urgently needed by \r\nour young people, who constitute more than 60 per cent \r\nof our population.\r\nJordanians have borne the refugee burden in full \r\naccordance with our country’s long humanitarian \r\ntraditions, but we know, and the world knows, that the \r\ncrisis is a global responsibility. The sacrifices we and \r\nother host countries make every day can continue only \r\nif donor nations hold up their side of the partnership. \r\nThat means making continued, multi-track efforts in \r\ndevelopment support and humanitarian assistance. \r\nSuch efforts not only prepare refugees to return home \r\nand rebuild their countries, but also give hope to the \r\npeople of host countries, who have sacrificed so much.\r\nThe world cannot address the refugee crisis or \r\nany global crisis unless we work together to support \r\nthose who are doing the right thing for the future we \r\nall share. Peace and prosperity demand constant, \r\ncollective action. The alternative is to fail our history \r\nand fail our future. Let us choose, instead, to succeed \r\nand give the world’s people, especially young people, \r\nconfidence in global justice, hope for new opportunity, \r\nand international laws, agreements and institutions that \r\neveryone can rely on.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the King of the Hashemite \r\nKingdom of Jordan for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, King \r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin \r\nHamad Al-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Emir of the \r\nState of Qatar.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, \r\nEmir of the State of Qatar, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin \r\nHamad Al-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nSheikh Al-Thani (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nI wish to congratulate Her Excellency María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés on assuming the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session. We wish \r\nher every success. I also express our appreciation to \r\nHis Excellency Miroslav Lajčák for his valuable efforts \r\nduring the seventy-second session. We pay tribute also \r\nto the relentless efforts of Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres to promote the role of the United Nations and \r\nachieve its lofty goals.\r\nI would like to express our sincere condolences to the \r\nfamily of Mr. Kofi Annan and to the United Nations on \r\nhis passing. He was one of the most important symbols \r\nof the United Nations and a promoter of international \r\ncooperation, development and peace among nations.\r\nThe world faces serious security, political and \r\neconomic threats and challenges that do not respect \r\nborders, which represents a real test for the collective \r\nsecurity of the United Nations. If the international \r\ncommunity wants to achieve international peace and \r\nsecurity, we must go beyond crisis management and seek \r\ncomprehensive and just solutions, in accordance with \r\nthe provisions of international law and the resolutions \r\nof international legitimacy, while rejecting selectivity, \r\ndouble standards and policies of the imposition of force.\r\nWe recognize and appreciate the vital importance \r\nof having an international and comprehensive point of \r\nreference reflected in a legitimate international order \r\nthat respects the rule of law. We must expedite the \r\nreform process of United Nations institutions in order to \r\nenable the Organization to shoulder its responsibilities, \r\nachieve its lofty goals and respond to the aspirations of \r\npeoples. That would enable us to bring about peaceful, \r\nequitable and sustainable societies, which is the theme \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n40/53 18-29769\r\nthat the President of the General Assembly has chosen \r\nfor this session.\r\nMore than a year after the illegal blockade imposed \r\non the State of Qatar, many facts have been revealed \r\nabout a pre-arranged campaign of incitement against \r\nit, as well as the insinuations and fabrications used to \r\ncreate the crisis. In the meantime, the international \r\ncommunity also recognized the falseness of the \r\nallegations made against my country to justify the \r\npremeditated measures taken under the pretext of those \r\nfabricated and untrue allegations, in flagrant violation \r\nof international law and basic relations between nations, \r\nas well as the values and norms of our peoples.\r\nDespite all the measures taken to undermine \r\nQatar’s security and stability and to create hardship \r\nfor its people, in addition to the economic warfare \r\nlaunched to hinder its development process, the period \r\nthat followed that unjust siege has witnessed the \r\nstrengthening of the status of the State of Qatar and \r\nthe consolidation of its role as an active partner in the \r\nregional and international arenas. Moreover, the Qatari \r\neconomy has continued to grow, proof of its vigour and \r\nconsistency. The State of Qatar has also maintained its \r\nadvanced and leading rankings compared with other \r\ncountries of the region in global indicators, especially \r\nin the areas of human security and human development. \r\nThat has strengthened the Qatari people’s faith in their \r\npotential, values and principles and increased their \r\ncohesion and unity.\r\nBelieving in the soundness of our legal position, \r\nin the need for the peaceful settlement of disputes and \r\nin dialogue as the best way to resolve crises, we have \r\nbeen, and remain, positively responsive to all the efforts \r\nof brotherly and friendly nations, which we appreciate, \r\nto end this crisis through unconditional dialogue, based \r\non mutual respect for the sovereignty of nations.\r\nIt is not reasonable for differences of opinion on the \r\nhandling of some regional issues to lead to paralysing \r\nthe effectiveness of an important regional organization \r\nsuch as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The \r\nblockade on Qatar has harmed the reputation of the \r\nGCC countries, and the paralysis of the GCC has \r\nreflected negatively on the role it aspires to play in \r\ndealing with regional and global issues. We hope that \r\nwe will all be able to transform the current plight of the \r\nGCC into an opportunity for reform and to put forward \r\nbinding mechanisms to resolve the differences among \r\nits States through dialogue, so as to avoid any similar \r\nrecurrence in future.\r\nIt is not right that our Arab region remains hostage \r\nbecause of some marginal differences — fabricated, \r\nin our case — which consume efforts and energy and \r\nwaste more funds than we allocate to the just causes \r\nupon which we are supposed to agree.\r\nLittle progress has been made on the lingering \r\nMiddle East issues, especially the Palestinian question, \r\nwhich represents the last vestiges of our world’s colonial \r\npast. The political process that began 25 years ago was \r\nan example of a departure from United Nations terms \r\nof reference to frameworks outside the Organization, \r\nwhich were perceived by some as the best and fastest \r\nway to settle and find solutions to that question. That \r\nprocess was supported by the Arab States and respectful \r\nof the Palestinian decision, but it has resulted in further \r\nstalemate and complexity. We are now witnessing \r\nattempts to eliminate the Palestinian question by \r\ndisregarding issues relating to a permanent solution, \r\nsuch as those of Jerusalem, refugees, sovereignty \r\nand borders.\r\nJust national issues cannot be resolved by becoming \r\nentangled in the balance of power between the occupier \r\nand the occupied. Such issues can be resolved only in \r\naccordance with certain principles, such as the right \r\nto self-determination and the inadmissibility of the \r\nannexation of territories of others by force, which have \r\nbecome part of international legitimacy.\r\nThe deterioration of the situation in the Palestinian \r\nterritories, particularly the inhumane conditions in \r\nthe Gaza Strip, the suffocating siege to which it is \r\nsubjected and the continued construction of settlements \r\nin occupied Jerusalem and the West Bank, are having \r\ngrave consequences and place a historic responsibility \r\non the Security Council. We reaffirm the importance of \r\nnegotiations, whose resumption is vital and which will \r\nrequire a commitment to resolutions of international \r\nlegitimacy, foremost among which are the two-State \r\nsolution and the Arab Peace Initiative, based on East \r\nJerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian State, along \r\nthe 1967 borders. Moreover, there can be no solution \r\nto the Arab-Israeli conflict without a just and lasting \r\nsolution to the Palestinian question. We abide by \r\nthat position, which is consistent with international \r\nlegitimacy and morally just. However, Israel rejects \r\nsuch a just settlement.\r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 41/53\r\nThe State of Qatar will spare no effort in providing \r\nvarious forms of material and political support to the \r\nbrotherly Palestinian people and in continuing to work \r\nwith all international actors involved in the Middle East \r\npeace process so as to overcome the difficulties that are \r\nobstructing the resumption of peace negotiations, in \r\naccordance with the terms of reference and resolutions \r\nof international legitimacy.\r\nAfter more than seven years, the international \r\ncommunity remains unable to find a solution to \r\nthe worsening Syrian crisis in all its aspects and \r\nits dangerous consequences. The Syrian people, in \r\naddition to the tragedies they have experienced, are \r\nconcerned and frustrated that the crimes of genocide, \r\nmass displacement and large-scale death in prisons, \r\nunder torture, could become common practice and that \r\nthe international community might get used to it.\r\nFailure to deter the Syrian regime from committing \r\ncrimes by waging a war against its own people, on \r\nthe one hand, and failure to hold it accountable after \r\nthe commission of such crimes, on the other, would \r\nrender the provisions of international law and human \r\nrights law devoid of meaning. That would have serious \r\nconsequences for the prevailing values of our world, \r\nas it would promote the use of violence as a means of \r\nsuppressing peoples’ aspirations and trampling on the \r\nrights of citizens and peoples of our region.\r\nWe are facing a humanitarian, moral and legal \r\ndisaster that requires the international community to \r\nurgently reach a political solution that stops the Syrian \r\nbloodshed, fulfils Syrian aspirations to justice and \r\nfreedom, maintains Syria’s unity and sovereignty and \r\nachieves security and stability in Syria and the region, \r\nin accordance with the first Geneva communiqué \r\n(S/2012/522, annex) and the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions. We emphasize the necessity of abiding by \r\ninternational humanitarian law and protecting civilians.\r\nRegarding the Yemeni issue, we underscore that \r\nthe firm position of the State of Qatar is to remain \r\ncommitted to the unity, independence and territorial \r\nintegrity of Yemen. We call upon all Yemeni parties \r\nto achieve national reconciliation and end the conflict, \r\non the basis of Security Council resolution 2216 (2015), \r\nthe Initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the \r\noutcomes of the national dialogue. From this rostrum \r\nI appeal to States that are active in the international \r\ncommunity to help the brotherly Yemeni people to \r\novercome current conditions, which we hope will soon \r\nend, take all measures necessary to address the grave \r\nhumanitarian situation and facilitate free access for \r\nhumanitarian assistance to all areas of Yemen. In that \r\nregard, I wish to announce Qatar’s agreement with the \r\nUnited Nations to fight cholera in Yemen by supporting \r\nprojects related to combating the causes of the disease \r\nand to halting its spread. We call upon other countries \r\nto join us in supporting that vital effort.\r\nTurning to the Libyan crisis, which has recently \r\nwitnessed developments that place the country’s \r\nsecurity and territorial integrity at risk, we look forward \r\nto the restoration of security and stability despite the \r\ntremendous challenges facing our Libyan brothers. \r\nWe note that foreign intervention in Libyan affairs \r\nfurther complicates the crisis, prevents the reaching \r\nof the national consensus that is sought by our Libyan \r\nbrothers and contravenes Security Council resolutions. \r\nWe reiterate our support for the Skhirat Agreement, \r\nsigned in December 2015, and all its outcomes. We \r\ncall upon all Libyan brothers to uphold the country’s \r\nnational interests and participate in a dialogue, without \r\nexcluding any component of Libyan society, in order \r\nto reach a comprehensive political settlement that \r\npreserves Libya’s sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nand realizes the aspirations of its people to security \r\nand stability.\r\nTurning to brotherly Iraq, we once again express \r\nour appreciation for the efforts of the Iraqi Government \r\nin restoring stability and achieving national \r\nreconciliation by cooperating with all political parties \r\nand components of the Iraqi society. We value the \r\nsuccesses and sacrifices of the Iraqi people in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism and extremism in all its forms. We \r\nreaffirm our commitment to supporting brotherly Iraq \r\nin the process of its reconstruction and development \r\nand assisting in every effort to seek to ensure its unity \r\nand sovereignty and enhance its security and stability.\r\nThere is consensus that terrorism has become \r\none of the most persistent challenges facing the world \r\nbecause of the real threat it poses to international peace \r\nand security. We underline the firm position of the \r\nState of Qatar in rejecting terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations anywhere in the world, regardless of \r\nreason or pretext. The fight against terrorism is a priority \r\nof the State of Qatar’s policy at the national, regional \r\nand international levels. We have developed legislative \r\nand institutional systems, fulfilled our international \r\nobligations related to the fight against terrorism and its \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n42/53 18-29769\r\nfinancing, and participated in all relevant international \r\nand regional efforts.\r\nIn our view, the following prerequisites are \r\nnecessary to ensure that the war on terrorism achieves \r\nits goal and does not turn into a self-contained \r\nstruggle. First, we need international cooperation in \r\ncombating violence resulting from extremism and \r\nviolence directed against civilians as a form of terror \r\nand aimed at damaging civilian facilities for political \r\nends. Those phenomena must be addressed firmly \r\nand rigorously. Secondly, we must unify standards for \r\nfighting terrorism so that its definition is not selective \r\nand does not depend on the religious or ethnic identity \r\nof the perpetrator. Thirdly, we must address its root \r\ncauses and research the political, social and cultural \r\nbackgrounds that contribute to fuelling it while working \r\nearnestly to achieve the just settlement of outstanding \r\nissues that give rise to anger and frustration. Fourthly, \r\nwe must avoid giving any partisan connotation to the \r\nterm “terrorism” by tailoring it to fit into the narrow \r\ninterests of some nations and using it to justify tyranny \r\nand the repression of political opponents, which affects \r\nthe credibility of the combat against terrorism and \r\nundermines the international efforts made in that field.\r\nWith that in mind, the State of Qatar believes \r\nthat educating young people and ensuring their \r\ncomprehensive participation represents the first line of \r\ndefence for the collective security system, as they are \r\nan important factor in fighting terrorism and building \r\npeace and stability. We have therefore committed to \r\neducating 10 million children and providing economic \r\nsupport to half a million young people in our region. In \r\ncollaboration with the United Nations, we have carried \r\nout projects to promote employment opportunities \r\nfor young people through capacity-building and have \r\nlaunched programmes to prevent violent extremism.\r\nHuman development and the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights are at the forefront of our \r\npriorities. The State of Qatar is pursuing efforts at \r\nthe legislative and institutional levels to implement \r\nits 2030 national vision, which emphasizes human \r\ndevelopment. This month, the State of Qatar acceded \r\nto the International Covenant on Civil and Political \r\nRights and the International Covenant on Economic, \r\nSocial and Cultural Rights. The State of Qatar recently \r\nenacted a law regulating the issue of political asylum in \r\nthe country, following the steps of developed countries, \r\nand another law granting the right to permanent \r\nresidence in the State under conditions prescribed by \r\nlaw. It has also decided to invite several international \r\nhuman rights organizations to establish regional offices \r\nin our country.\r\nNo one doubts the importance of the development \r\nof information and digital technology and digital \r\nmeans of communication. The economy and day-\r\nto-day life would be inconceivable without them. \r\nHowever, a series of recent events in several countries \r\nhave reminded us that new needs are emerging, such as \r\nthe need for freedom of access and the need to protect \r\nthe private lives of citizens from the risk of hacking. It \r\nalso alerted us to the cybersecurity of nations, which \r\nis a cross-border issue because of the nature of the \r\ntechnology itself.\r\nAccordingly, we must regulate how those issues \r\nare dealt with and control their risks internationally. \r\nQatar and other countries have suffered from digital \r\npiracy and digital espionage, which has prompted \r\nus to strongly emphasize the issue. We are willing \r\nto work with United Nations bodies to devise legal \r\nregulations. In that regard, we propose the convening \r\nof an international conference to examine means of \r\nregulation in that area by international law, and we \r\nexpress our readiness to host such a conference.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Emir of \r\nthe State of Qatar for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, \r\nEmir of the State of Qatar, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\nMr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Hassan \r\nRouhani, President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rouhani (spoke in Farsi; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I take this \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 43/53\r\nopportunity to congratulate you, Madam, on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-third session.\r\nWe have assembled here today as the world is \r\nsuffering from the recklessness of and disregard by some \r\nStates for international values and institutions. We are \r\nhere because the preservation of interests and security \r\nin the world in the least costly manner is possible \r\nonly through the cooperation of and coordination \r\namong countries. However, it is unfortunate that we \r\nare seeing rulers in the world who think that they \r\ncan better secure their own interests, and who, at \r\nleast in the short term, ride public sentiment and gain \r\npopular support by fomenting extremist nationalism, \r\nracism and xenophobic tendencies that resemble a \r\nNazi disposition, while trampling global norms and \r\nundermining international institutions, even through \r\npreposterous and anomalous acts such as convening a \r\nhigh-level meeting of the Security Council.\r\nThe illusion that one can aspire to securing greater \r\npeace and security at the cost of denying others that \r\nsame peace and security should be cast aside once and \r\nfor all. We should not allow any breathing space for or \r\nthe development of a line of thinking that holds others \r\nto ransom through the artificial creation of insecurity. \r\nIn that regard, confronting multilateralism is not a sign \r\nof strength; rather, it is the symptom of intellectual \r\nweakness and betrays an inability to understand a \r\ncomplex and interconnected world.\r\nUnder such circumstances, the negligence or \r\ninefficacy of international institutions can endanger \r\nworld peace. Those seeking dominance and hegemony \r\nare enemies of peace and are the perpetrators of war. \r\nThe Government of the United States of America — at \r\nleast the current Administration — seems determined \r\nto render all international institutions ineffectual. That \r\nGovernment, having withdrawn from a multilateral \r\nagreement adopted by the Security Council, in \r\ncontravention of the rules and norms of international \r\nlaw, has invited the Islamic Republic of Iran to bilateral \r\ntalks. The Administration that is inviting Iran to engage \r\nin talks is not ready to consult its own experts or willing \r\nto recognize the requirements of a modern State, \r\nincluding the paramount principle of the continuity of \r\nState responsibility and, therefore, is openly violating \r\nthe State obligations undertaken by its predecessor.\r\nOn what basis and criteria can we enter into \r\nan agreement with an Administration that is guilty \r\nof such misconduct? Any talks should take place \r\nwithin the framework and in continuation of the Joint \r\nComprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2231 (2015), and not within a \r\nframework of breaching such agreements and reverting \r\nto the past. It is ironic that the United States Government \r\nis not even concealing its plan to overthrow the same \r\nGovernment that it is inviting to talks.\r\nThe approach of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the \r\nfield of foreign policy has been based on multilateralism \r\nand compliance with the recognized principles of \r\ninternational law. Our respect for the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the long \r\nand difficult negotiations with the five plus one group, \r\nwhich led to the conclusion of the Joint Comprehensive \r\nPlan of Action, is a clear illustration of that approach.\r\nWe are pleased that the international community \r\ndid not acquiesce to the United States Government’s \r\nunilateral and illegal withdrawal from the JCPOA and \r\nadopted a categorical position vis-à-vis that decision. \r\nThe JCPOA was the outcome of more than a decade of \r\ndiplomatic efforts and a period of intensive negotiations \r\nto resolve an artificial crisis. It was unanimously \r\napproved through the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 2231 (2015) and codified into an international \r\nobligation. The resolution calls on all countries and \r\ninternational and regional organizations to support the \r\nimplementation of the JCPOA and refrain from any \r\nactions that would undermine the implementation of \r\ncommitments under the JCPOA.\r\nAccording to 12 consecutive reports of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has thus far \r\ncomplied with all of its commitments. However, from \r\nthe very beginning, the United States did not honour its \r\nobligations. The current Administration, resorting to \r\nf limsy excuses and in open violation of its commitments, \r\nfinally withdrew from the accord. The United Nations \r\nshould not allow its decisions to fall victim to the \r\ndomestic elections and propaganda games of some of \r\nits Members and should not allow any Member State to \r\ndodge the execution of its international commitments.\r\nMoreover, the United States also pressures \r\nother countries to violate the nuclear accord. More \r\ndangerously, the United States is threatening all \r\ncountries and international organizations with \r\npunishment if they comply with Security Council \r\nresolution 2231 (2015). It is the first time in the history \r\nof the United Nations that such a general invitation \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n44/53 18-29769\r\nto violate the law has been coupled with threatening \r\nlaw-abiders with punishment. That is not unique to the \r\nJCPOA; it is a pattern that even applies to the United \r\nStates approach to the International Criminal Court.\r\nWe appreciate the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity, the European Union, Russia and China in \r\nsupporting the implementation of the JCPOA and for \r\nconsidering the full realization of the commitments \r\nstipulated in it a precondition for the survival of that \r\nsignificant accomplishment of diplomacy.\r\nUnlawful unilateral sanctions constitute a form \r\nof economic terrorism and a breach of the right to \r\ndevelopment. The economic war that the United \r\nStates has initiated under the rubric of new sanctions \r\nnot only targets the Iranian people, but will also have \r\nharmful repercussions for the people of other countries. \r\nMoreover, that war has caused a disruption to the state \r\nof global trade.\r\nThe Iranian people have demonstrated their \r\nunwavering resilience over the past 40 years, despite \r\nthe difficulties and constraints caused by sanctions, and \r\nhave also shown that they can overcome such difficult \r\nperiods. The multi-millennial history of our country \r\ndemonstrates that Iran and Iranians have never broken \r\nin the face of a storm — not even been bowed.\r\nI state here, in clear, unambiguous terms, that the \r\nUnited States policy vis-à-vis the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran has been wrong from the beginning, and its \r\napproach of resisting the wishes of the Iranian people, \r\nas manifested in numerous elections, is doomed to fail. \r\nIran, with its historical and civilizational longevity, \r\nrich cultural heritage and foremost geopolitical position \r\nis an undeniable reality. Policies of engagement and \r\ncooperation with Iran have produced positive outcomes \r\nfor other nations, as best reflected in Iran’s cooperation \r\nwith friendly countries in the fight against terrorism.\r\nThe United States understanding of international \r\nrelations is authoritarian. In its estimation, might \r\nmakes right. Its understanding of power, not of legal \r\nand legitimate authority, is reflected in its bullying and \r\nimposition. No State or nation can be brought to the \r\nnegotiating table by force and, if so, what follows is an \r\naccumulation of the grapes of wrath in those nations, \r\nwhich is later reaped by the oppressors.\r\nWe concur that ultimately there is no better \r\nalternative to dialogue. However, dialogue is two-\r\nway; it should be based on equality, justice and human \r\nintegrity and honour and conducted in accordance \r\nwith the rules and norms of international law. Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2231 (2015) is not merely a piece \r\nof paper. We invite the United States to return to that \r\nresolution and come back to the negotiating table it \r\nleft. If the United States dislikes the JCPOA because \r\nit is the legacy of its domestic political rivals, then we \r\ninvite it to return to that Security Council resolution. \r\nWe invite that country to remain in international \r\ninstitutions and implore it not to engage in imposing \r\nsanctions. Sanctions and extremism are two sides of the \r\nsame coin. Extremism involves negating the thinking \r\nof others, and sanctions negate the life and prosperity \r\nof people.\r\nFor dialogue to take place, there is no need for a \r\nphoto opportunity. The two sides can listen to each \r\nother right here in the Assembly. I am starting the \r\ndialogue right here and state, in unequivocal terms, that \r\nthe question of international security is not a toy for \r\nAmerican domestic politics. The United Nations is not a \r\npart of the United States Administration. Dialogue can \r\nresume in the Assembly from the same point at which \r\nit stopped and by the same person who left the dialogue \r\ntable and walked away from the accord. Beginning that \r\ndialogue starts with the ending of threats and unjust \r\nsanctions that negate the principles of ethics and \r\ninternational law.\r\nOur proposal is clear: commitment for commitment, \r\nviolation for violation, threat for threat and step for step, \r\ninstead of talk for talk. What Iran is saying is clear: \r\nno war, no sanctions, no threats and no bullying, just \r\nacting in accordance with the law and the fulfilment \r\nof obligations. We support peace and democracy in the \r\nentire Middle East. We consider nuclear knowledge an \r\nimperative and nuclear weapons prohibited.\r\nAs victims of terrorism in the past and today, \r\nwe have always been and will always remain at the \r\nforefront of genuine confrontation of terrorism. Today \r\nwe mourn the martyrdom of the dozens of innocent \r\npeople who were murdered on Saturday in cold blood \r\nby terrorists who shamelessly accepted responsibility \r\nfrom a number of Western capitals for their heinous \r\ncrime in interviews with Western-based broadcasting \r\noutfits that are financed by petrodollars.\r\nWe in Iran have unequivocally condemned all acts \r\nof terrorism and will continue to do so. We welcome \r\nthe strong statement from the Security Council on \r\nthis issue. But why can the leaders of those terrorist \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 45/53\r\noperations, including the organization that has publicly \r\nclaimed responsibility for Saturday’s crime, live and \r\noperate freely in Western countries, and even openly \r\nsolicit funds? Are those activities not in violation of \r\ninternational counter-terrorism norms? Why have \r\nthe official State financiers of anti-Iranian terrorist \r\norganizations, with their record of financing Al-Qaida, \r\nthe Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and the Al-Nusra \r\nFront, not only been spared any punishment but are also \r\nsupported and armed? If the United States wants the \r\nworld’s public to take its claim of fighting terrorism \r\nseriously, it is imperative that it start a joint global \r\ncampaign to fight that scourge, irrespective of the \r\nvictims or culprits.\r\nIn that regard, from the very beginning of the \r\ncrisis in Syria we have warned against any foreign \r\nintervention in the internal affairs of that country \r\nand the use of unlawful means, including supporting \r\nextremist and terrorist groups, in order to exert pressure \r\non the Government of Syria. We have consistently \r\nemphasized that the crisis can be resolved only through \r\nintra-Syrian dialogue. To that end, the presence of our \r\nmilitary advisers in Syria has been at the request of \r\nthe Syrian Government, is consistent with international \r\nlaw and has aimed to assist the Syrian Government \r\nin combating extremist terrorism. Iran, Russia and \r\nTurkey, in cooperation with the Government of Syria \r\nand other Syrian parties, have succeeded through the \r\nAstana process, the third summit meeting of which \r\ntook place in Tehran earlier this month, in playing a \r\npositive role and reducing tension in Syria. Their last \r\njoint effort prevented escalation and bloodshed in the \r\nIdlib region.\r\nWe have witnessed a tragic humanitarian catastrophe \r\nin Yemen over the past three years, which has caused \r\nthe destruction of infrastructure, the death  and injury \r\nof hundreds of thousands of people, the displacement of \r\nmillions of innocent civilians, widespread famine and \r\nchronic disease. Those inhumane acts represent clear \r\nexamples of crimes against humanity and war crimes. \r\nThe crisis in Yemen can be resolved only through \r\nintra-Yemeni talks and without foreign interference. To \r\nthat end, we are ready to assist in any possible way.\r\nThe most pressing crisis in the Middle East, \r\nhowever, is the question of Palestine. The passage of \r\ntime cannot, and must not, justify occupation. The \r\ninnumerable crimes of Israel against the Palestinians \r\nwould not have been possible without the material \r\nand military assistance and political and propaganda \r\nsupport of the United States. Israel, equipped with \r\na nuclear arsenal and blatantly threatening others \r\nwith nuclear annihilation, presents the most daunting \r\nthreat to regional and global peace and stability. The \r\nabhorrent United States decision to transfer its Embassy \r\nin Israel to Jerusalem and the recent enactment of the \r\nracist Jewish State law are violations of international \r\nlaw and norms, as well as unmistakable manifestations \r\nof apartheid.\r\nThe expansion of relations with neighbours and the \r\ncreation of a more secure and more developed region \r\nare among the main priorities of Iran’s foreign policy. \r\nA few weeks ago Iran, along with the other four coastal \r\nStates of the region, signed the Convention on the \r\nLegal Status of the Caspian Sea, which will strengthen \r\ngood-neighbourliness and bring about prosperity and \r\nprogress for all of the coastal States.\r\nWe also desire the same relations with our southern \r\nneighbours in the Persian Gulf. We believe in the \r\nformation of a collective mechanism for the Persian \r\nGulf region, with the presence and participation of all \r\nregional countries. The security of the Persian Gulf and \r\nthe Strait of Hormuz has always been important for us \r\nand, just as we upheld their security during the war \r\nimposed on us by Iraq, we will confront any disruptive \r\neffort regarding that critical waterway in the future.\r\nWe espouse a peaceful view on political and \r\ninternational issues and have not sought, and do not \r\nseek, war with any country. Iran does not need an \r\nempire. Iran is an empire in terms of civilization and \r\nculture, not through political domination. Iran has \r\nserved as the link between East and West and will \r\ncontinue to do so, remaining a meticulous guardian for \r\na world free from violence.\r\nMr. Boukadoum (Algeria), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is the same State that \r\nunderstood the fascist nature of the Ba’athist regime \r\nin Iraq before anyone else in the world and bravely \r\nresisted its aggression against us. We fought against \r\nthe Ba’ath Party of Iraq before it occupied Kuwait. The \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran is the same State that was at \r\nthe forefront of the struggle against Taliban terrorism \r\nand gave up martyrs in that struggle. We fought against \r\nAl-Qaida and the Taliban before the attacks on New \r\nYork and Washington, D.C. The Islamic Republic of \r\nIran is the same State that fought against Da’esh, a fake, \r\ndistorted representation of Islam. We were engaged in \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n46/53 18-29769\r\nthe fight against Da’esh before its operations in Paris, \r\nLondon and Brussels.\r\nAppreciate those historical realities regarding Iran, \r\nstop imposing sanctions and end extremism. The world \r\ndoes not have a better friend than Iran, if peace is what \r\nit seeks.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the \r\nRepublic of Finland\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Finland.\r\nMr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the Republic \r\nof Finland, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Sauli Niinistö, President of \r\nthe Republic of Finland, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Niinistö: I wish to start by paying tribute \r\nto Secretary-General António Guterres for his vision \r\nin leading the United Nations. Finland wholeheartedly \r\nsupports him in his important task.\r\nMy country has always been a strong advocate of \r\nmultilateral cooperation. For Finland, the rules-based \r\ninternational order is of fundamental importance. At \r\nhome, being able to rely on commonly agreed rules is a \r\ncornerstone of our own national security and welfare. At \r\nthe global level, common solutions and rules are needed \r\nto address the most pressing challenges of our time.\r\nUnfortunately, for those of us who believe in the \r\nbenefits of multilateralism, there is now reason to \r\nbe worried. The international system that we have \r\nbuilt together is under pressure and its capability and \r\ncredibility are being questioned. We can no longer take \r\nthe rules-based order for granted. It is our common \r\nresponsibility to actively defend and develop it.\r\nFinland sees the United Nations as the core of the \r\nmultilateral system. The defence of multilateralism \r\nmust therefore begin here. The United Nations and \r\nits Members need to show their will to act together, \r\nnot past each other. We fully support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s ambitious and comprehensive reform agenda. \r\nNow is the time to implement those reforms. We must \r\nensure that the United Nations of the future is more \r\ntransparent, accountable and efficient.\r\nFor the United Nations to be credible, it has to \r\npractice what it preaches. For any organization, every \r\nsingle case of sexual exploitation in its own ranks is \r\none case too much. That is particularly true for an \r\norganization that stresses the importance of equality \r\nand human rights. I am proud to be a member of the \r\nCircle of Leadership on Preventing and Responding \r\nto Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, and I welcome the \r\nefforts taken to prevent and combat all forms of abuse \r\nthroughout the United Nations system.\r\nThe three pillars of the United Nations — peace \r\nand security, human rights and development — have \r\nstood the test of time. However, we have also discovered \r\nthat many present global challenges do not respect the \r\nboundaries among them. The pillars are increasingly \r\ninterlinked, as are the challenges themselves. The most \r\nimportant achievements of the United Nations system in \r\nrecent years are testimony to that. In that regard, I refer \r\nto the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the \r\nParis Agreement and the global compact for migration \r\nand the global compact on refugees. Issues such as \r\nsustainability, climate change and migration are not \r\nonly about development and human rights, but they are \r\nalso essential questions of peace and security.\r\nClimate change is the prime example of the need \r\nfor prompt global action. The upcoming report of \r\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will \r\nfurther underscore the urgency of our response. It will \r\nalso show how much remains to be done. So far, the \r\nvoluntary contributions from the States parties to the \r\nParis Agreement are not enough to keep the global \r\ntemperature rise well below 2°C. We must do a lot \r\nmore, and more quickly.\r\nIn the North, we are witnessing how the Arctic \r\nregion is warming at an alarming pace. That is not \r\njust a regional problem, as it poses a threat to the \r\nentire global climate system. One important factor in \r\naccelerating the melting of sea ice in the Arctic is black \r\ncarbon emissions. Reducing black carbon that lands on \r\nthe white ice would have immediate positive effects \r\nin preventing melting. A commitment to curbing \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 47/53\r\nthose emissions would be a key objective of an Arctic \r\nsummit, which Finland, as the current Chair of the \r\nArctic Council, is ready to host.\r\nWithout mitigation, climate change will also lead \r\nto a further increase in migration f lows. Approximately \r\n65 million people across the world are already \r\ndisplaced, the highest figure since the Second World \r\nWar. About 100 million people worldwide are in urgent \r\nneed of basic humanitarian assistance, and that number \r\nis growing. There are no quick and easy solutions, but \r\ndoing nothing is not an option. I therefore welcome \r\nthe global compact for migration and look forward to \r\nparticipating in the conference to adopt it in Marrakesh \r\nin December.\r\nFull-scale wars, conflicts of varying intensity \r\nand breaches of international law continue to haunt \r\nus. They constantly remind us of the immense human \r\nsuffering involved. We, the international community, \r\nneed to remain persistent in our efforts to solve ongoing \r\nconflicts, regardless of how deep-rooted and long-\r\nlasting they may be.\r\nOn a positive note, we have been encouraged by \r\nrecent attempts to hold a genuine dialogue between \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\ninternational community. The momentum to take \r\nsteps towards a peaceful Korean peninsula should \r\nbe maintained and supported. A successful outcome \r\nin that region could also set a powerful example for \r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament elsewhere.\r\nWhere peace has been achieved, the relevance of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping remains beyond doubt. \r\nBut the Blue Helmets will also need to adapt to changing \r\nrealities. We support the Secretary-General’s Action \r\nfor Peacekeeping initiative to make United Nations \r\npeacekeeping more effective.\r\nWhile existing conflicts need to be solved, our \r\npriority must be to prevent future ones. Finland \r\nwelcomes the efforts to strengthen the United Nations \r\nconflict-prevention capacity. Mediation is an invaluable \r\ntool when it comes to conflict prevention. It is vital for \r\nthe future of mediation that experience gained in the \r\npast be passed on to future mediators. It was an honour \r\nfor my country to host the meeting of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s High-level Advisory Board on Mediation in \r\nJune. We remain strong supporters of the mediation \r\nactivities of the United Nations and other actors. Where \r\nappropriate, Finland also continues to offer its good \r\noffices to facilitate concrete discussions among parties, \r\nfrom track-two diplomacy to high-level meetings.\r\nPeace and security, human rights and development \r\nare not sustainable without the participation of \r\nwomen and youth. Female voices and young voices \r\nmust be heard and acted upon. The needs of women, \r\nchildren and youth are still all too often marginalized \r\nin peace talks. Finland promotes the role of women’s \r\neffective participation in peace processes through the \r\nNordic Women Mediator’s Network. That and other \r\nsimilar networks provide a useful platform for advocacy \r\nand self-education. As a HeForShe Impact Champion, I \r\nhighly value those efforts.\r\nAs we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, its importance \r\nin the international order deserves special attention. \r\nHuman rights not only protect the individual, but they \r\nalso help us to prevent conflicts, build sustained peace \r\nand speed up development. If we are serious about human \r\nrights, then accountability mechanisms for crimes \r\nagainst international law are needed. Perpetrators must \r\nbe brought to justice. Finland appeals to all Member \r\nStates and the Secretary-General to consistently keep \r\nhuman rights, non-discrimination and gender equality \r\nat the top of the agenda of the United Nations.\r\nIt was with profound sadness that I learned of the \r\npassing of Mr. Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General \r\nof the United Nations. His legacy is an inspiration to us \r\nall. Like the Secretary-General earlier today, I would \r\nlike to conclude by remembering the following words \r\nfrom him:\r\n“More than ever before in human history, we \r\nshare a common destiny. We can master it only if \r\nwe face it together. And that, my friends, is why we \r\nhave the United Nations”.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Finland for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the Republic \r\nof Finland, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of \r\nthe Federal Republic of Nigeria\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Federal Republic \r\nof Nigeria.\r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n48/53 18-29769\r\nMr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Muhammadu Buhari, \r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Buhari: On behalf of the Government \r\nand the people of Nigeria, I congratulate Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés on her well-deserved \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-third session. As she embarks upon her \r\nassignment, I would like to assure her of Nigeria’s \r\nsupport in no less measure than that which we extended \r\nto her predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák. \r\nWe appreciate his effective leadership of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session, his dedication, \r\ncommitment and the fairness with which he treated all \r\nMember States. I also salute our Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. António Guterres, who has steered the \r\naffairs of the Secretariat with a focused commitment to \r\nthe collective United Nations pursuits of global peace \r\nand security, equity and justice, inclusiveness, women’s \r\nempowerment and human rights.\r\nIt is appropriate at this point to remember with \r\ndeep sadness our late seventh Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, who passed away on the eve of his \r\neighty-second birthday. Kofi Annan’s significant \r\ncontributions to the work of the Organization have \r\nbeen acknowledged in the well-deserved tributes that \r\npoured in from around the world following his death. \r\nWe in Africa, while mourning the loss of this great son \r\nof ours and citizen of the world, take pride in the way \r\nhe served humankind in a truly exemplary manner. \r\nHe demonstrated in his calm but determined manner \r\nthe virtues of compassion, dedication to the cause of \r\njustice, fairness and human rights. He was a visionary \r\nleader who inspired hope, even in the face of the most \r\ndaunting challenges. He devoted his entire life’s career \r\nto the United Nations and the pursuit of its ideals and \r\ngoals. The world is indeed a better place thanks to his \r\nexemplary service.\r\nDuring the past year, the world saw some positive \r\nresults and encouraging signs from the bilateral and \r\nmultilateral efforts of the international community \r\nin addressing conflicts, crises and threats to world \r\npeace. We particularly commend the efforts of the \r\nleaders of the United States, North Korea and South \r\nKorea in making headway towards our shared goal of \r\na nuclear-free Korean peninsula. In that connection, \r\nwe acknowledge the commitment to peace shown by \r\nPresident Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong \r\nUn by initiating a historic summit. We urge them to \r\ncontinue that positive engagement.\r\nRegrettably, many of the crises and threats to \r\npeace and security around the world, on which we \r\ndebated last year and several previous years, remain \r\nunresolved. In some cases, matters have deteriorated. \r\nThe continuing plight of the Rohingyas in Myanmar, \r\nthe protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the wars in \r\nYemen and Syria and the fight against international and \r\nlocal terrorism, such as Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab, \r\ncome to mind. The terrorist insurgencies that we face, \r\nparticularly in the Sahel and the Lake Chad basin, are \r\npartly fuelled by local factors and dynamics, but now \r\nincreasingly by the international jihadi movement, \r\nrunaway fighters from Iraq and Syria and arms from \r\nthe disintegration of Libya.\r\nFortunately, the carnage appears to have somewhat \r\nabated in Myanmar. We commend the United Nations \r\nfor staying focused on the situation of the Rohingya \r\npeople in order to bring their suffering to an end and \r\nhold to account the perpetrators of the atrocious crimes \r\ncommitted against innocent and vulnerable members \r\nof that community, including women, children and \r\nthe elderly. The international community should \r\nstrengthen its resolve to combat ethnic and religious \r\ncleansing everywhere. We support the United Nations \r\nefforts in ensuring that the Rohingya refugees are \r\nallowed to return to their homes in Myanmar with \r\nsecurity, protection and a guarantee of citizenship. We \r\nnote the indication by the Government of Myanmar \r\nof its willingness to address those issues, and we \r\nencourage it to do so expeditiously. In that context, \r\nNigeria commends the Government and the people of \r\nBangladesh in particular, and all other countries and \r\norganizations that have contributed to shouldering the \r\nburden of providing shelter and other vital assistance to \r\nthe Rohingya refugees.\r\nThe carnage and the worsening humanitarian \r\nsituations in Syria and Yemen continue unabated. But \r\nthe international community cannot afford to give up \r\non the Syrian and Yemeni peoples. We must pursue all \r\nefforts to find peaceful negotiated political solutions \r\nto those wars, which cannot be won by the force of \r\narms alone. Regarding Syria, we hope that the United \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 49/53\r\nNations-sponsored Geneva process and the Sochi \r\ninitiative, led by Russia, Iran, and Turkey, can advance \r\nthat objective. The international community must keep \r\nup the pressure to encourage the parties to pursue the \r\npath of dialogue, negotiations and inclusiveness in \r\nresolving their sectarian divides and bringing to an \r\nend the immense human suffering in Syria, as well \r\nas in Yemen. We commend Turkey, Jordan, Greece, \r\nGermany, Italy and France for hosting the millions of \r\nthe refugees f leeing those brutal conflicts.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East, as grave as it \r\nhas always been, is now worsened by developments \r\nsince we last met (see A/72/PV.3). Nigeria continues \r\nto call on the Israelis and the Palestinians to make \r\nthe necessary compromises in the interests of justice, \r\npeace and security, in line with numerous United \r\nNations resolutions and applicable international law. \r\nUnilateral, arbitrary and insensitive actions only \r\nprolong the conflict and undermine world peace and \r\nsecurity. The deteriorating humanitarian situation in \r\nGaza is an appalling result of the unrestrained use of \r\npower. We urge both parties to re-engage in dialogue \r\non the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions, \r\nthe Madrid principles, the Quartet road map and the \r\nArab Peace Initiative, among others. Nigeria reaffirms \r\nits unwavering support for a just two-State solution, \r\nnegotiated without intimidation and with Israel and \r\nPalestine existing side-by-side in peace and security. \r\nThe crises in the Middle East have deep roots and have \r\nremained unresolved for too long. Yet we should not \r\nfall into self-defeating despair and conclude that they \r\nare not amenable to solution.\r\nWe should draw inspiration from the remarkable \r\nleadership that motivated Ethiopia and Eritrea to restore \r\nlong-lost hope for peace between them, a remarkable \r\nshow of statesmanship that has now galvanized \r\nneighbouring countries, including Djibouti and \r\nSomalia, to push for peace in the subregion. I believe \r\nthat with hard work, commitment and a disposition to \r\ncompromise and make the necessary sacrifices, peace \r\nis achievable in the Middle East as well. Most crises \r\nusually have a variety of festering causes and effects. \r\nIt is the failure to address them early and effectively \r\nthat lead to out-of-control conflicts. Addressing them \r\nincludes national and international collective actions \r\nthat have a positive impact on peoples and communities. \r\nTherefore, “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”, which \r\nis the theme for this year’s General Assembly, is very \r\napt indeed.\r\nA topical consequence of the current conflicts \r\naround the world is the irregular migration of affected \r\npeople from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa \r\nto Europe. Irregular migration entails huge avoidable \r\nloss of human lives, puts strains on services in host \r\ncountries and communities and fuels anti-immigrant \r\nand racist sentiments in Europe. That is why we \r\nwelcome the successful conclusion of the negotiations \r\non the first-ever global compact for safe, orderly and \r\nregular migration. We look forward to its adoption in \r\nMarrakech later this year. The aim is to protect the \r\nrights of migrants worldwide while addressing the \r\nconcerns of countries of origin, transit and destination \r\nalike. Migration is a constant in human affairs. We \r\nin Africa are grateful to countries that treat migrants \r\nwith compassion and humanity, notably Germany, Italy \r\nand France. Irregular migration is not a consequence \r\nof conflicts alone, but of the effects of climate change \r\nand the lack of opportunities at home. Climate change \r\nremains one of the greatest challenges of our time. Very \r\nclose to us at home, it is our lot in Nigeria, together with \r\nour neighbours around the Lake Chad basin, to live \r\nwith the climate change consequences of a drastically \r\nshrunken Lake Chad and the parching up of otherwise \r\nfertile arable lands.\r\nLake Chad was a major source of livelihood for \r\nthe more than 45 million inhabitants of the region. Its \r\nshrinking has meant the loss of such livelihoods, and \r\nthe region’s inhabitants have been impoverished and \r\nmade vulnerable to the activities of extremists and \r\nterrorist groups. The instability caused in the subregion \r\nhas intensified internal displacements, leading, among \r\nother consequences, to intense economic competition, \r\nespecially between farmers and herdsmen. That is \r\nwhy we continue to call for dedicated international \r\nengagement to accelerate recovery efforts in the Lake \r\nChad basin to address the root causes of the conflicts \r\nin the region. What is required is continuous and robust \r\nUnited Nations cooperation with national Governments \r\nand subregional and regional organizations, such as \r\nthe Lake Chad Basin Commission, the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States and the African \r\nUnion, to enhance capacity in conflict prevention, \r\nconflict management and peacebuilding.\r\nWith regard to the Lake Chad basin plight, I extend \r\nour heartfelt appreciation to the United Nations, the \r\nGovernments of Germany, Norway, the United States, \r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n50/53 18-29769\r\nSweden, the United Kingdom and France and a host of \r\nother development partners for their laudable support \r\nin assisting us in addressing both the humanitarian \r\nchallenges and the ongoing stabilization drive in \r\nthe region.\r\nCorruption within countries and the illicit f low of \r\nfunds across national boundaries have a huge negative \r\nimpact on the stability, peace and economic prospects \r\nof millions in developing countries. Corruption \r\nsignificantly deprives national Governments of \r\nresources to provide meaningful livelihoods for their \r\npopulations, who are predominantly young people, \r\nthereby giving rise to more irregular migration. The \r\nfight against corruption therefore involves us all. It \r\nis in our collective interest to cooperate in tracking \r\nillicit financial f lows, investigate and prosecute \r\ncorrupt individuals and entities and repatriate such \r\nfunds to their countries of origin. Fighting corruption \r\nand resolving international conflicts, crises and \r\nwars; defeating terrorism and piracy; curbing arms \r\ntrafficking and the proliferation of small arms and light \r\nweapons, which fuel such conflicts, in particular in \r\nAfrica; stemming irregular migration by addressing its \r\nroot causes; and the many other global challenges we \r\nare faced with today can be effectively addressed only \r\nthrough multilateral cooperation and concerted action.\r\nThe only global institutional framework we have to \r\naddress those challenges is the United Nations system. \r\nThat is why we continue to call for the strengthening of \r\nthe Organization to make it more effective by speeding \r\nup the pace of progress towards its reform, including \r\nthat of its principal organ, the Security Council. The \r\nreconstitution of the Council to make it more equitable \r\nand more representative of our global community is \r\nboth a political and moral imperative. We believe that a \r\nreformed Security Council, with expanded membership \r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent categories, is \r\nin accord with prevailing international consensus and it \r\nis in our collective interest to do so. It is high time we \r\nstop skirting around the issue and establish achievable \r\nbenchmarks and time frames for such reforms.\r\nI assure all members that in such advocacy \r\nI am only reflecting Nigeria’s deep and abiding \r\ncommitment to our Organization and its founding \r\nprinciples and goals. From the day we joined in 1960, \r\nwe have contributed our quota to the fulfilment of the \r\nmandate of the United Nations. We have been active \r\nparticipants in many Security Council- and African \r\nUnion-authorized peacekeeping operations around \r\nthe world, beginning with the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo in 1960. Furthermore, Nigeria has always \r\nmobilized the required human and material resources \r\nto achieve certain United Nations goals, including \r\nthe recently adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. We are resolute in complementing the \r\nefforts and examples of the United Nations to promote \r\ngender equality and youth empowerment as necessary \r\npillars for sustainable development.\r\nWithout such efforts there can be neither enduring \r\npeace nor security. As we craft and implement our \r\nnational policies to achieve the goals set, we, in the \r\nspirit of international solidarity, will readily cooperate \r\nwith other nations seeking to achieve similar goals \r\nfor their own populations to help ensure that no one is \r\nleft behind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa, \r\nPresident of the Republic of South Africa\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa.\r\nMr. Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa, President of the \r\nRepublic of South Africa, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Excellency Mr. Matamela Cyril \r\nRamaphosa, President of the Republic of South Africa, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ramaphosa: I have the honour to \r\naddress the General Assembly for the first time as \r\nPresident of the Republic of South Africa.\r\nIt is nearly a quarter of a century since the founding \r\nfather of our democracy, President Nelson Rolihlahla \r\nMandela, stood at this rostrum to declare that\r\n“The millions across our globe who stand \r\nexpectant at the gates of hope look to this \r\nOrganization to bring them peace, to bring them \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 51/53\r\nlife, to bring them a life worth living.” (A/49/PV.14, \r\np. 10)\r\nAs we mark the centenary of the birth of this great \r\nglobal leader, Nelson Mandela, we are bound to ask \r\nwhether the United Nations has met the needs and \r\nexpectations of the millions who stand at the gates of \r\nhope. We are bound to ask what contribution the United \r\nNations has made to a more peaceful, more prosperous \r\nand more equal world. More important, we are called \r\nupon to ask — as we did yesterday during the Nelson \r\nMandela Peace Summit (see A/73/PV.5), which was \r\nheld here — what the United Nations and the assembled \r\nglobal leadership must do to secure lasting peace, \r\nreconciliation and stability across the globe.\r\nAllow me to express the deep gratitude of the \r\nGovernment and the people of South Africa to the \r\ninternational community for convening the Peace \r\nSummit to honour the memory of Nelson Mandela and \r\nadvance his legacy. We applaud the political declaration \r\nof the Summit (resolution 73/1), which recognizes the \r\nperiod from 2019 to 2028 as the Nelson Mandela Decade \r\nof Peace. It ref lects a new and sincere commitment by \r\nthe world’s leaders to comprehensively advance peace \r\nand security and resolve all conflicts and wars. To \r\nsucceed in giving effect to that commitment, the United \r\nNations must become what billions of people across the \r\nworld want it to be, that is, a representative and truly \r\ndemocratic global parliament of the people of the world.\r\nThroughout its seven decades, the United Nations \r\nhas been a source of hope for the oppressed, exploited \r\nand poor around the world. During the dark days of \r\ncolonialism and apartheid, we drew strength, inspiration \r\nand encouragement from the United Nations and its \r\nCharter in our quest for freedom and self-determination. \r\nWith the support of the United Nations, 24 years ago, \r\nwe as South Africans were able to bring an end to \r\nthe nightmare of apartheid. Nelson Mandela led us to \r\nfreedom and gave us the great opportunity to transform \r\nour country. We have now embarked upon a journey of \r\ntransformation and are making progress to deal with \r\nthe ugly legacy of the past system of apartheid.\r\nMadiba’s vision continues to guide us as we seek \r\nto improve the lives of our people in many respects, \r\namong others, by improving educational outcomes for \r\nour youth and transforming our economy, which was \r\nconstituted to serve the interests of a few. We have \r\nstarted a comprehensive dialogue on the question of \r\nland reform in our country, which is guided by our \r\nConstitution and the rule of law, as we seek ways to \r\nensure that the land is shared among all who work it, \r\nas set out in our Freedom Charter. Even as our country \r\nis experiencing difficult economic challenges, we \r\nhave made progress. We are reforming our economy \r\nand creating an environment that is conducive to \r\ninvestment and have embarked upon an investment \r\ndrive to attract $100 billion in the next five years. To \r\nthe poor, vulnerable and marginalized, the United \r\nNations today is a beacon of promise in a landscape of \r\ndoubt. To billions across the world, the United Nations \r\nis the most powerful instrument we possess to achieve \r\na more equal, humane and inclusive world.\r\nThere are men and women with dreams and \r\naspirations that transcend the hardships of the present, \r\nwho want to contribute to a new global civilization \r\ndefined by care, justice and solidarity. They want an \r\nend to the greed, ignorance and conceit that is driving \r\nthe destruction of our only home, the Earth. It is within \r\nour ability, as the leaders assembled here today, to forge \r\na more representative, equal and fair United Nations \r\nthat is empowered and equipped to lead the struggle to \r\nend poverty, unemployment and inequality in the world.\r\nWe are a youthful world: more than half the global \r\npopulation is under the age of 30. That is even more \r\npronounced on our continent of Africa, where two \r\nthirds of our people were not yet born when Nelson \r\nMandela was released from 27 years in prison. We are \r\nliving in the age of youth. That places a responsibility \r\non us as leaders not only to put the interests of young \r\npeople at the centre of our efforts, but also to empower \r\nwomen and young people to be more prominent in \r\ndirecting the course of global affairs. It is young people \r\nwho are fighting the wars that we started. It is women \r\nwho are bearing the brunt and hardships of the wars \r\nthat continue to destroy their lives and their families. \r\nAs we speak, young lives are being lost and futures are \r\nbeing destroyed.\r\nThere is an urgency to the measures we must take to \r\nend conflict and war. Not only must we stop the death, \r\ndestruction and human suffering that is visited daily \r\non millions of people, but we must act with purpose \r\nto prevent the loss of another entire generation to its \r\naftermath. We must accept our shared responsibility \r\nfor, and our shared interests in, ending conflict and \r\nusing the outcomes of the Nelson Mandela Peace \r\nSummit to empower the United Nations to be a more \r\neffective instrument for mediation, peacekeeping and \r\npost-conflict reconstruction.\r\nA/73/PV.6 25/09/2018\r\n52/53 18-29769\r\nOur resolve to end ongoing conflicts and our \r\ndetermination to root out terrorism must be matched \r\nby action and the appropriate deployment of resources. \r\nWe must act with the same urgency to resolve some of \r\nthe world’s most protracted and intractable disputes. \r\nThe fact that the people of Palestine have endured \r\noccupation and suffering for nearly as long as the \r\nUnited Nations has existed makes their plight no less \r\npressing and their suffering no more acceptable. We \r\nmust likewise intensify our efforts to secure the right \r\nof the people of Western Sahara to self-determination \r\nand full national sovereignty.\r\nOne of the greatest challenges to the achievement \r\nof global prosperity and development is the continued \r\nexclusion of millions of women and young people from \r\nmeaningful economic participation. It is therefore vital \r\nthat we deploy all the means at our disposal to address \r\nyouth unemployment and ensure universal access to \r\neducational opportunities appropriate to the changing \r\nworld of work. We need a deliberate programme to \r\nensure that the digital revolution, which carries such \r\ngreat potential for both disruption and empowerment, \r\nis effectively harnessed to promote social justice as \r\nwell as human progress. The call to leave no one behind \r\nrequires that we strengthen the institutions of global \r\ngovernance and make them more responsive to the needs \r\nof young people, particularly in the developing world.\r\nInstitutions such as the United Nations, the World \r\nBank, the International Monetary Fund and the World \r\nTrade Organization need to be reshaped and enhanced \r\nso that they may more effectively meet the challenges \r\nof the contemporary world and better serve the interests \r\nof the poor and marginalized around the globe. Reform \r\nof the United Nations, and of the Security Council in \r\nparticular, must be a priority if we are to give full effect \r\nto the values and principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe must resist any and all efforts to undermine the \r\nmultilateral approach to international trade, which is \r\nessential to the promotion of stability and predictability \r\nin the global economy. The history of the global \r\neconomy informs us that no country can prosper at the \r\nexpense of all others and that no people can hope to live \r\nin comfort and security as long as millions of others \r\nlanguish in poverty.\r\nIt is therefore essential that we take collective \r\nresponsibility for the development of all nations and \r\nfor the improvement of the lives of all people. That \r\nresponsibility is manifest in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on \r\nFinancing for Development, among other agreements. \r\nTogether they represent our common commitment to \r\ntackle poverty, underdevelopment and environmental \r\ndegradation. They represent our common commitment \r\nto tackle diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, \r\nmalaria, diabetes and cancer. Our task as global leaders \r\nis to pursue the policies required to turn intent into \r\nimplementation and mobilize the resources needed to \r\nturn implementation into impact.\r\nWe have made significant strides as Africans in \r\naddressing the challenges that have confronted our \r\ncontinent for many decades. We continue vigorously to \r\nimplement our commitments set out in the African Union \r\nAgenda 2063, which is our collective plan as Africans \r\nto rid our continent of under-development, poverty \r\nand conflict and to improve democratic governance, \r\nthe rule of law and the promotion of human rights. We \r\nhave recently reached agreement on the establishment \r\nof an African Continental Free Trade Area, which will \r\nfundamentally transform African economies, giving \r\nrise to a new industrial age on the continent. We are \r\nworking to silence the guns in Africa by 2020, to bring \r\nan end to conflicts that have cost the lives of millions \r\nof our people, displaced more and stunted economic \r\ngrowth and human development.\r\nAs the continent with the youngest population \r\nin the world, Africa has the potential to be the next \r\ngreat frontier for global growth and development. \r\nWith effective investment in education, improved \r\nhealth care, good governance and greater economic \r\nintegration, Africa has the potential to develop its \r\nproductive capacity on a scale and at a rate that will lift \r\ntens of millions out of poverty. The youth of Africa are \r\npoised to transform their continent.\r\nWe the people of South Africa are committed to \r\nbeing part of that transformation. From the ashes of a \r\nsystem that was described by the General Assembly \r\nas a crime against humanity, we are building a new, \r\ndemocratic nation, united in its diversity. We are \r\nworking to correct the injustices of our past and to \r\nbuild a society that is free, inclusive and sustainable. \r\nWe are pursuing an economic path that draws on the \r\nresources and capabilities of all our people to eradicate \r\npoverty, unemployment and inequality. We are \r\ndetermined through our international relations to be a \r\nforce for progress, good, peace and global equality, and \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.6\r\n18-29769 53/53\r\nwill continue to advance the interests of the African \r\ncontinent and the global South.\r\nAllow me to conclude by once more drawing on \r\nthe wisdom of Nelson Mandela, who said, “Sometimes \r\nit falls on a generation to be great.” This is not the \r\ngeneration that will stand expectant at the gates of \r\nhope; this is the generation that will change the world. \r\nIt is the generation of young people who want to see \r\nchange. This is their time and this is their age. Let their \r\ngreatness blossom.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof South Africa for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa, President of the \r\nRepublic of South Africa, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.25 p.m.\r\n"
