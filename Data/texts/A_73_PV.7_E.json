"United Nations A/73/PV.7\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n7th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 25 September 2018, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Korneliou \r\n(Cyprus), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.25 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President \r\nof the Republic of Malawi\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Malawi.\r\nMr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mutharika: The General Assembly is a \r\nrepresentation of humankind in its fullness. I therefore \r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly. \r\nHer ascendance to this seat reminds us that there are \r\nno minorities in the Organization, and we are proud \r\nto see the Assembly led by a woman of her repute \r\nand intellectual prowess. Once again, I convey to her \r\nmy congratulations.\r\nTen days ago, Africa lost a Malawian who was \r\nour first Ambassador to the General Assembly. David \r\nRubadiri represented the conscience of the African \r\ncontinent and a pan-African poet who was adopted \r\nby East Africa as its son. One month ago, the world \r\nlost an African who was the first Secretary-General \r\nof the United Nations from black Africa. Kofi Annan \r\nwas an African and an inspiring spirit of the world. He \r\nwas a voice of peace, a voice for the voiceless and the \r\nconscience and moral arbiter of the world. He decisively \r\ncarried forward the f lag of peace amid turmoil when \r\nsome of us were busy declaring war on peace.\r\nToday I stand to urge the Assembly to raise high \r\nthat f lag of peace for which my brother Kofi Annan \r\nstood. I urge the Assembly to rise and march forward \r\nin that spirit of defending peace. Peace is a universal \r\ndesire. We all desire peace. It must be diligently sought \r\nby us all. Peace is precious. Peace is delicate. It must \r\nbe jealously guarded by us all. We cannot sit here as \r\na proud Assembly while out there human communities \r\nare being driven from their homes, forced to abandon \r\ntheir countries and condemned to unknown destinies \r\nof homeless survival. Every human needs a home. We \r\ncannot be proud as members of humankind when out \r\nthere innocent children, voiceless men and vulnerable \r\nwomen are suffering and being killed. Every life is \r\nprecious. History will measure our global leadership \r\nand the legacy of the Organization on the scales of how \r\nwe defend the defenceless, feed the hungry and empower \r\nthe weak. History will judge our generation on how we \r\ndefend human life and protect this endangered planet. \r\nIt is therefore our shared responsibility to seek peace in \r\nall its forms, defend peace and reach out to reason with \r\nthose who declare war on peace.\r\nThe relevance of the Organization rests on our \r\nability to satisfy the needs of people across the \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

That includes Africa, as I will argue in my \r\nconclusion. Let us never doubt that the pursuit of \r\nshared responsibility implies collective inclusion. \r\nEvery nation is important, and we all have something to \r\noffer. That is why I began my address by reminding the \r\nAssembly that there are no minorities here. There are \r\nno small nations. There are only nations in the United \r\nNations. Of course, let us admit that there will always \r\nbe economic inequality among nations and, yes, we \r\nall have something to offer to humankind. But those \r\nwith more resources and power must step up and offer \r\nmore. Let us remember that power is not status; power \r\nis responsibility. Leadership is not prestige; leadership \r\nis responsibility. We must define global leadership in \r\nterms of global responsibility.\r\nWe are prepared to fulfil our responsibility and \r\nobligations in the global community. Malawi remains \r\ncommitted to the ideals of the United Nations. Malawi \r\nsubscribes to the values of democratic governance, \r\npeace and security. We remain committed to \r\nparticipating in efforts to maintain international peace \r\nand security. Malawi remains committed to promoting \r\nand protecting human rights. We remain committed to \r\nparticipating in international cooperation to resolve the \r\nchallenges that face human societies.\r\nMalawi acknowledges the sacrifices being made by \r\nthe Blue Helmets. The composition of the Blue Helmets \r\ndemonstrates the commitment of the United Nations \r\nto the principle of including nations of all regions. We \r\nare proud to be an active contributor to peacekeeping \r\noperations across the world. For us, defending peace is \r\na precious sacrifice. Malawi has served in peacekeeping \r\nmissions in Darfur, Lesotho and Côte d’Ivoire. As I \r\nspeak, we are part of the United Nations Organization \r\nStabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo.\r\nIn our pursuit to promote peace, justice and effective \r\ninstitutions, I would like to announce that in 2019 a high-\r\nlevel political forum on Sustainable Development Goal \r\n16 will convene in Malawi. I welcome the opportunity \r\nand honour of hosting the forum. I believe that the event \r\nwill be a significant catalyst to our resolve to achieve \r\nSustainable Development Goal 16.\r\nMalawi supports the determination of the United \r\nNations to galvanize international cooperation in \r\npromoting socioeconomic development. We are \r\ncommitted to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. We support the priorities of the United \r\nNations in eradicating poverty and hunger in all its \r\nforms and dimensions. The priorities of the United \r\nNations are also Malawi’s priorities, and we will not \r\nrelent until we have accomplished the full hierarchy of \r\nour priorities.\r\nWe are proud of our efforts and achievements in \r\nmaternal health, girls’ education, youth empowerment \r\nand gender equality. However, the plight of refugees \r\nand migrants is a concern for the people of Malawi. \r\nAs Malawians, we believe that refugees are part \r\nof our human family. We believe in our collective \r\nresponsibility to ensure refugees’ protection, safety and \r\naccess to refuge. As a result, Malawi has been hosting \r\nrefugees for decades.\r\nI would also like to report that this year Malawi \r\nreceived a high-level delegation from the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. \r\nWe are actively part of the initiative to develop a \r\ncomprehensive refugee response framework, which \r\nwas agreed by States Members. We have developed the \r\nconcept for the framework that is to be rolled out in \r\nMalawi within our national development strategy and \r\nour cooperation agreement with the United Nations.\r\nOn another matter, Malawi is both a victim and \r\na fighter of climate change. The consequences of \r\nclimate change are real, devastating and often tragic \r\non a large scale. For that reason, I would like to urge \r\nall Governments, business leaders, investors and civil \r\nsociety to fight to bend the curve of carbon dioxide \r\nemissions by 2020 and to meet the goals of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change.\r\nWe must move to accelerate the green transition, \r\ncreate more jobs and provide sustainable transport \r\nand clean energy systems. Malawi is doing its part \r\nby implementing various disaster risk-reduction and \r\nresilience-building initiatives, but we cannot do it \r\nalone. We need adequate, predictable and sustainable \r\nresources of climate financing, such as the Green \r\nClimate Fund, in order to support our actions.\r\nI would also like to report that my Government is \r\nendeavouring to eliminate hunger and malnutrition by \r\n2030. Given the hostile consequences of climate change, \r\nfood insecurity and malnutrition are serious threats \r\nin a country that still relies on rain-fed subsistence \r\nagriculture.\r\nWe believe that inclusive and resilient economic \r\ngrowth is key to overcoming hunger and reducing \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 3/49\r\npoverty. In that regard, over the past four years we have \r\nrelentlessly pursued macroeconomic measures that are \r\nnow improving Malawi’s economy. We have stabilized \r\nthe economy within four years despite the natural \r\ndisasters of f loods, drought and hunger that hit Malawi \r\nfor two consecutive years. Within four troubled years, \r\nwe have reduced inflation from 24 per cent to a single \r\ndigit percentage. We have reduced interest rates from \r\n25 to 16 per cent. We have taken our import cover from \r\nthe lowest to the highest point in our economic history. \r\nOur import cover has risen from less than two months \r\nto six months. We have made the local currency stable \r\nand predictable.\r\nAbove all, when I began my leadership in Malawi \r\nfour years ago, we were seeing a 2.4 per cent growth \r\nrate in gross domestic product. We now expect growth \r\nof 4 per cent in our 2018-2019 financial year, and \r\nwe expect that to rise to 6 per cent in 2019. We are \r\nimproving those macroeconomic indicators because a \r\nbad economy is an injustice to our country’s citizens.\r\nAt the same time, we continue to focus on the \r\njustice of specific sectors of our society. We are fighting \r\nagainst violence against women and girls. I believe \r\nthat no human society can meaningfully develop while \r\nmarginalizing its women. Development must always be \r\ninclusive. With the support of the United Nations and \r\nother development partners, particularly the European \r\nUnion, in 2019 Malawi will implement the Spotlight \r\nInitiative to eliminate violence against women and girls.\r\nI reiterate that no society can progress without \r\nits young people. Malawi is therefore implementing \r\na number of youth programmes, including a skills \r\ndevelopment programme that involves establishing \r\ncommunity technical colleges. We are empowering \r\nyoung people with skills so that they can create jobs \r\nand businesses for themselves and others. We believe \r\nthat no society can develop without a skilled labour \r\nforce. Our urgent need is to train the trainers for that \r\nyouth programme.\r\nI would also add that Malawi believes that citizens \r\nof every nation must have legal identities. Malawi \r\nhas fulfilled that principle. Today, more than 95 per \r\ncent of my people aged 16 and older have national \r\nidentity cards, and we are in the process of integrating \r\nthe national identity cards to be used in education, \r\nfinance, agriculture, security, social welfare and other \r\npublic institutions.\r\nMalawi will always be a team player in the \r\ninternational community. We support the United \r\nNations initiatives in fighting global systemic threats \r\nand challenges, including terrorism and climate change. \r\nWe support the United Nations development system. In \r\nthat regard, Malawi welcomes the adoption of resolution \r\n72/279, on the repositioning of the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system, as well as resolution 72/305, on \r\nthe review of the implementation of resolution 68/1, on \r\nthe strengthening of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nWe strongly support the Common African Position \r\ncalling for two permanent seats with veto power and \r\nfive non-permanent seats for Africa on the Security \r\nCouncil. Why should some nations be afraid of losing \r\npower by offering decision-making space to Africa \r\nif they do not lose power when they accommodate \r\nother continents? Is Africa that much of a threat? That \r\nsegregation of Africans must come to an end. Why \r\nshould we allow the Organization to be accused of the \r\nhypocrisy that while we preach democracy everywhere, \r\nwe are not democratic enough to accommodate almost \r\none third of the membership of the Assembly?\r\nI would like to conclude by commending the ironic \r\nwisdom in the theme that was chosen for this year. Let \r\nus prove that we can live up to its demands. We cannot \r\ntalk about shared responsibility while we marginalize \r\nAfricans and deny them full participation in our \r\ndecisions. We cannot talk about the global leadership \r\nof the United Nations when African leadership is not \r\nat the decision-making tables. In any political system, \r\nwe cannot claim relevance for the people that we deny.\r\nThe time has come to make the United Nations \r\nrelevant to all people. The time has come to show a \r\nglobal leadership that is inclusive of all nations. The \r\ntime has come to pledge shared responsibilities together \r\nwith Africa and the rest of the world. The time has \r\ncome for this Assembly to listen to the voice of Africa. \r\nLet us listen.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Malawi for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n4/49 18-29775\r\nAddress by Mr. Jimmy Morales, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guatemala\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic \r\nof Guatemala.\r\nMr. Jimmy Morales, President of the Republic \r\nof Guatemala, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Jimmy Morales, President \r\nof the Republic of Guatemala, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Morales (spoke in Spanish): As I \r\nam participating in the opening of this session of \r\nthe General Assembly, it gives me great pleasure to \r\ncongratulate Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on \r\nher election to preside over this world forum as the \r\nfirst Latin American woman and the fourth woman in \r\nhistory to hold the position. I wish her success and have \r\nno doubt that she will do an excellent job throughout \r\nthis session.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of \r\nGuatemala, I would like to thank the international \r\ncommunity and the various humanitarian assistance \r\norganizations for their solidarity and support in the face \r\nof the tragedy that occurred in my country on 3 June as \r\na result of the volcanic eruption that caused irreparable \r\nhuman losses, hundreds of injuries, extensive material \r\ndamage and resulted in more than 1.7 million victims.\r\nToday we have the opportunity to reflect on the \r\nrole played by the United Nations in the world order, \r\nrespecting the sovereignty of the countries that make \r\nit up, and I am more than ever convinced that our task \r\nis no greater than our forces. Behind me is a symbol \r\nthat in this era, in which we find so many barriers \r\nand differences, we can associate with peace and \r\ncooperation, and see as a meeting point for dialogue, \r\ntolerance and respect. At the same time, I represent \r\nGuatemala, a country with strong traditions and a \r\npeople that believes in God, that loves and respects the \r\nfamily as the basis of society, that sees life as starting \r\nat conception, and that is dedicated to freedom and the \r\nconstruction of a peaceful society. One example of this \r\nview of our country and of our search for permanent \r\npeace is Guatemala’s iron determination to resolve \r\npeacefully and definitively the territorial, insular and \r\nmaritime dispute that we have had with Belize for more \r\nthan a century and a half.\r\nI am pleased to share with the Assembly that, on \r\n15 April, a referendum was held in Guatemala on the \r\nquestion of submitting this case to the International \r\nCourt of Justice, resulting in a resounding “yes”. \r\nNinety-six per cent of voters voted in favour in the most \r\nparticipatory referendum in the country’s history. We \r\nare convinced that the resolution of this dispute will \r\nbring economic, social and political benefits to both \r\ncountries. We therefore also welcome the decision of \r\nthe Government of Belize to set the date of 10 April \r\n2019 for its own referendum, and we look forward to \r\nthe results with great enthusiasm.\r\nThe pursuit of development in the region also \r\nleads to peace and prosperity. We can share with joy \r\nthat Central American economic integration continues \r\nto grow in strength and make progress after half a \r\ncentury. This year, we took a historic step with the \r\nestablishment of a customs union between Guatemala, \r\nHonduras and El Salvador. For Central America, this \r\ncustoms union means that 80 per cent of bilateral trade \r\nwill enjoy the free transit of goods, thanks to tariff \r\nharmonization. Similarly, the cost of moving goods has \r\nbeen reduced by between 21 and 25 per cent, boosting \r\nexports and generating an increase in  our countries’ \r\ngross domestic product and improving tax collection \r\nand our companies’ competitiveness. According to \r\ndata from the World Bank, transit across our borders \r\nhas been reduced from between six and 55 hours to 15 \r\nminutes. This customs union turns the three Central \r\nAmerican countries into a market of 32 million people.\r\nGuatemala’s efforts to combat transnational threats \r\nare unprecedented in the region. The determination and \r\ncommitment of the Guatemalan security forces have \r\nenabled us to eradicate more than 471 million poppy \r\nplants, worth $1.4 billion, over the past two years, with \r\nthe cooperation of United States agencies. We have \r\nseized 34,000 kilos of cocaine and increased heroin \r\nseizures by 400 per cent over previous years. This \r\nmeans that in two years we have seized more drugs than \r\nin the previous eight years combined, preventing more \r\nthan 30 million United States and European citizens \r\nfrom being affected by the consumption of these drugs.\r\nGuatemala has made important advances in the \r\nareas of transparency and the fight against corruption. \r\nOur Open Government initiative and mechanism are \r\nworking on the basis of our third national action plan, for \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 5/49\r\nthe period from 2016 to 2018, which has fulfilled 87 per \r\ncent of its commitments in the areas of access to public \r\ninformation, fiscal transparency, civic participation, \r\ntechnological innovation and accountability.\r\nGuatemala has worked hard to comply with \r\nthe international standards of the Global Forum \r\non Transparency and Exchange of Information for \r\nTax Purposes, and has ratified the Convention on \r\nMutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters \r\nof the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment (OECD). These efforts have enabled us \r\nto be removed from the list of countries considered to \r\nbe tax havens. In the same vein, the General Secretariat \r\nof the Presidency of the Republic of Guatemala \r\nhas received ISO 9001:2015 certification for the \r\nquality of its management, and it recently received \r\nISO 37001:2016 certification for its anti-bribery \r\nmanagement system, the only such certification in \r\nthe world. The management system helps institutions \r\nto improve their overall performance and provide a \r\nsolid basis for sustainable development initiatives. \r\nIt is also a tool for nurturing integrity, transparency, \r\nhonesty and compliance with standards that minimize \r\nthe risk of bribery by complying with legal obligations. \r\nIn addition, 16 years after the last census, we carried \r\nout a national population and housing census this year \r\nwith state-of-the-art digital cartography, reaching \r\n96 per cent of households, which will contribute to \r\nquality statistical information that will be vital for the \r\nevaluation and measurement of our public policies.\r\nI will now address the issues of security and justice, \r\nbecause my Government has been and always will be \r\nrespectful of the law and the rule of law. With my head \r\nheld high, I can say that there is no sign of corruption in \r\nthe management of our Government. On the contrary, \r\nas President of the Republic, I have led the fight against \r\ncorruption and efforts to increase governmental \r\ntransparency and accountability. Proof of this is that we \r\nhave taken important steps with the OECD to improve \r\ngood practices in favour of governmental transparency.\r\nIn line with the foregoing, we believe it necessary \r\nto respect the sovereignty of each country and to \r\nguarantee full freedom and recognize the beliefs, values \r\nand principles of each State, and not to impose a global \r\nbureaucratic agenda that dictates how that bureaucracy \r\nthinks things should be.\r\nAfter almost four decades of internal armed \r\nconflict, Guatemalans signed a strong and lasting \r\npeace, and we have undertaken the very arduous and \r\ndifficult task of building and maintaining it. Building \r\npeace is no easy task, as the grave consequences of the \r\narmed conflict weakened our institutions. Guatemala is \r\nthe only State to have signed a cooperation agreement \r\nwith the United Nations Secretariat establishing an \r\ninternational commission against impunity, known \r\nas the International Commission against Impunity in \r\nGuatemala (CICIG), which was originally to last for \r\ntwo years. In weighing the initiative’s value, the State \r\nof Guatemala decided to extend that period five times. \r\nUnder the direction of three Commissioners, the CICIG \r\nhad its high and low points, and as a sovereign State \r\nGuatemala decided not to request a sixth extension, as \r\nwe believe that more than a decade has provided it with \r\nenough time to fulfil its mandate. At the same time, we \r\nhave asked the Secretary-General to begin transferring \r\ncapacities to those Guatemala institutions responsible \r\nfor ensuring justice, in accordance with the mandate.\r\nThe State of Guatemala is grateful for the \r\ntechnical support provided by CICIG in strengthening \r\nits democratic institutions, and we appreciate its \r\ncontributions to fostering a culture of transparency and \r\ncombating impunity and, especially, corruption. We \r\nare also grateful to the international community for \r\nits financial support in sustaining CICIG throughout \r\nthese years. For the sake of transparency, it would be \r\nvery fitting for the Secretary-General to report on the \r\ndetails of the use of resources since the establishment \r\nof the Commission so as to inform the international \r\ncommunity on the allocation of the approved funds. \r\nGiven the circumstances, it is essential to familiarize \r\nthe international community with the reasons why it \r\nwas decided not to extend CICIG’s mandate.\r\nFirst, it violated the political Constitution of the \r\nRepublic, our laws and the very agreement on which its \r\nestablishment was based, while overreaching the limits \r\nof its mandate, manipulating justice and undermining \r\nthe presumption of innocence and due process. \r\nSecondly, Commissioner Velásquez meddled in the \r\ncountry’s internal affairs, while politicizing justice \r\nand judicializing politics; those abuses have polarized \r\nGuatemalan society and led to an environment of \r\ninstability jeopardizing national security. In recent \r\nyears, increasing doubts have been raised about CICIG \r\nat the national and international levels and, to our \r\nastonishment, a case involving the persecution of a \r\nRussian family, the Bitkovs, became known throughout \r\nthe world. The United States Helsinki Commission has \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n6/49 18-29775\r\nrequested CICIG to provide it with information on that \r\nmatter, and the Commission has repeatedly refused \r\nto do so. That refusal to demonstrate accountability \r\nentirely contradicts the spirit of the Commission’s fight \r\nagainst impunity.\r\nI reiterate my country’s astonishment that despite \r\nthe fact that the Guatemalan Government expressed \r\nits concerns about CICIG abuses, it took a case \r\naffecting international interests to get the international \r\ncommunity to understand the injustices committed \r\nby that United Nations Commission. In that regard, I \r\nwant to point to the indifference and passivity of the \r\nSecretary-General, whom I personally and officially \r\ninformed for more than a year of the concerns of the \r\nGovernment of Guatemala about the bad practices of \r\nCICIG and its Commissioner. I want to make it clear \r\nthat I will not defend those who are corrupt or advocate \r\nfor anyone involved in a judicial process pitted against \r\nthe Guatemalan justice system. At the same time, \r\nhowever, no one can deny that, just like the Bitkovs, \r\nmany Guatemalan people and families have also \r\nsuffered illegal persecutions and violations of their \r\nhuman rights and constitutional guarantees at the hands \r\nof the Commission, which has enjoyed total impunity.\r\nHow is it that the principles of the presumption \r\nof innocence and due process have been violated \r\nby CICIG in Guatemala? Contrary to the guidelines \r\nfor international human rights instruments and the \r\nGuatemalan constitutional order, the Commission’s \r\nstatements always began with press conferences, \r\nmediating cases in violation of the presumption of \r\ninnocence, because through such mediation pressure was \r\nexerted on judges and magistrates with regard to their \r\ndecisions. The statement made by the jurist who heads \r\nthe Commission — to the effect that persons become \r\nless innocent as investigations and the criminal process \r\nmove forward — violates the political Constitution of \r\nour Republic, which guarantees the human right to the \r\npresumption of innocence. A person remains innocent \r\nuntil a final finding of guilt is handed down.\r\nWe would be remiss if we did not mention another \r\nabuse, which is the occurrences involving the excessive \r\nuse of force and abuse of power that have become \r\npopularly known as “CICIG black Thursdays”, which, \r\nin addition to the aforementioned press conferences, \r\ninclude arrests and raids characterized by the use of \r\nexcessive force accompanied by the presence of dozens \r\nof heavily armed police with high-calibre rif les. In \r\nthat regard, Guatemala was astonished by one such \r\nraid, on 2 November 2016, which involved illegal \r\nentry into the presidential residence. This abuse was \r\ndeplorable because, in addition to breaking through the \r\nthree security perimeters of the presidential residence, \r\nthe very institutional integrity of our country was \r\njeopardized. CICIG personnel and United Nations \r\nvehicles took part in that raid.\r\nThose facts were included in a document addressing \r\nthe concerns of the State of Guatemala delivered \r\npersonally to the Secretary-General more than a year \r\nago. The fact that CICIG has made the excessive use \r\nof pretrial detention the rule in Guatemala, when it \r\nshould be used only in exceptional circumstances, \r\nmust also be addressed. Under the laws of Guatemala, \r\nno one must remain in pretrial custody for more than \r\nthree months, but in cases involving CICIG, some were \r\nheld on remand for more than three years and remained \r\nincarcerated for an additional five years as the judicial \r\nprocess unfolded, only to be found innocent later.\r\nTo date, hundreds of people have remained in years-\r\nlong pretrial custody. In one such case, the so-called \r\nPeacock case, one person was tried in Guatemala, \r\nanother in Austria and yet another in Spain. In all \r\nthree countries, the evidence presented by CICIG was \r\njudged insufficient, and they were found not guilty. \r\nToday we mourn five deaths caused by the abuse of \r\npretrial detention, in which pressure from CICIG on \r\njudges led them to fail to provide alternative forms of \r\nincarceration that would have ensured the delivery of \r\nadequate medical treatment. I call attention to the fact \r\nthat such inhumane treatment has not been meted out to \r\neven the most dangerous criminals or drug traffickers.\r\nAnother case that I would like to bring up is that \r\nof Alfredo Zimeri, a young man of 19 years of age, \r\nwho was brutally beaten by members of the CICIG \r\nstaff, causing multiple and serious fractures to his face \r\nand skull. Mr. Velásquez exceeded the authority of his \r\nmandate, in addition to finding himself in a conflict of \r\ninterest, when he requested recorded footage from the \r\nsurveillance cameras, which is evidence that only the \r\npublic prosecutor is authorized to handle. Should this \r\nbe described as justice or as impunity?\r\nEssentially, CICIG has become a threat to \r\npeace in Guatemala. It has set up a system of terror \r\nwhereby anyone who thinks differently is tracked \r\ndown, investigated and accused by or referred to the \r\nCommission so as to coerce witnesses, whom it later \r\nturns into effective collaborators by offering them \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 7/49\r\nsummary trials and reduced sentences. Unfortunately, \r\nthe CICIG ideal has been lost in the bureaucracy of \r\nthe United Nations and in the cult of the individual, \r\nwhich as a matter of principle should never be greater \r\nthan the institution it represents. What is certain is \r\nthat today Guatemala is more polarized than it has \r\nbeen for decades. Some say that we did not have this \r\nkind of polarization even during the armed conflict in \r\nGuatemala in the 1980s. Groups of people with extremist \r\nviews have sought to take advantage of the fight \r\nagainst corruption, applauding selective persecutions \r\nthat have been turned into overt demonstrations by an \r\nideologically biased CICIG. We in Guatemala do not \r\nwant more confrontation, we want peace and justice. \r\nWith the same respect that we have always shown, I \r\nam publicly asking the Secretary-General, before the \r\nAssembly, if we can agree on appointing a new CICIG \r\nCommissioner to carry out the transfer of technical \r\ncapabilities to the appropriate bodies. Guatemala has \r\nacted in good faith at all times and we continue to \r\nbelieve firmly that disputes can be resolved amicably \r\nthrough dialogue.\r\nTurning to other subjects, we should point out \r\nGuatemala is a country located in a vulnerable tropical \r\nzone that is suffering increasingly seriously from the \r\neffects of climate change. We are once again dealing \r\nwith a prolonged drought affecting the most vulnerable \r\nsectors of our population. That is why we have invested \r\nin rehabilitating all of our irrigation and mini-irrigation \r\nsystems, which can help to ensure low-income farmers’ \r\nproduction. We have focused our public investment \r\nbudget on our national development priorities and have \r\nalso been able to contribute to global environmental \r\nefforts by designing a technology called bio-fences for \r\ndecontaminating rivers, beaches, seas and oceans that \r\nhas been recognized by the World Economic Forum. \r\nWe continue to work to combat chronic malnutrition \r\nthrough our 2016-2020 national strategy and policy for \r\nthe prevention of chronic malnutrition, which is directly \r\nrelated to the Sustainable Development Goals aimed \r\nat ending hunger, achieving food security, improving \r\nnutrition and ensuring quality education.\r\nI am very pleased to know that the Assembly \r\nhas made progress with the negotiations for a global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration. My \r\nGovernment is clearly focused on improving security and \r\ndevelopment conditions in order to reducing migration \r\nand the risks that migrants run when embarking on \r\ndangerous journeys in their quest to improve their \r\nquality of life. In the meantime, we will continue \r\nworking to strengthen our entire consular network.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to send a message \r\nof unity and peace to my people and to the entire \r\ninternational community. I will return to my country \r\nwith the vision and hope of a better tomorrow for all. \r\nI would like to end by quoting the great Ruben Darío \r\nwhen he said about his country: “If your homeland is \r\nsmall, dream it big”.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Guatemala for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jimmy Morales, President of the Republic \r\nof Guatemala, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, President of \r\nthe Arab Republic of Egypt\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Arab Republic \r\nof Egypt.\r\nMr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, President of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, \r\nPresident of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Al Sisi (spoke in Arabic): I would like to \r\ncongratulate Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on \r\nassuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-third session, and to express my appreciation \r\nfor the efforts of Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, the President of \r\nthe previous session.\r\nI also commend the President on her choice of \r\ntheme for this year’s session, for as Member States \r\nwe desperately need to renew our commitment and \r\ncontributions to reinforcing the role and status of \r\nthe United Nations as the basic foundation of a just \r\nand effective international order, based on a balance \r\nof interests and responsibilities, respect for State \r\nsovereignty and the dissemination of a culture of \r\npeace, as well as in enabling us to rise above racism, \r\nextremism and violence while achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Those are the values that have shaped \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n8/49 18-29775\r\nEgypt’s vision in relation to the United Nations since \r\nwe co-founded it seven decades ago, and throughout \r\nthe six terms that Egypt has served on the Security \r\nCouncil, the latest of which was in 2016 and 2017. \r\nThose values are also the driving force behind Egypt’s \r\nactive contribution to United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations, which makes us the world’s seventh-largest \r\ntroop-contributing country.\r\nDespite that strong belief in the values and role of \r\nthe United Nations, we have to admit in all frankness \r\nthat there is a f law in the international system that has \r\na negative effect on its performance and casts a shadow \r\nover its credibility for many peoples, particularly in \r\nthe Arab and African regions, at the heart of which \r\nEgypt is situated. How can we blame Arabs who \r\nquestion the credibility of the United Nations and \r\nthe values it represents at a time when their region is \r\nthreatened by the disintegration and collapse of nation \r\nStates, giving way to a wave of terrorism as well as to \r\nreligious and sectarian conflicts that deplete the Arab \r\npeoples’ resources? How can we blame Arabs who \r\nwonder why the Palestinian people have been denied \r\ntheir legitimate rights to live in dignity and peace in an \r\nindependent State that reflects their national identity, \r\nhopes and aspirations?\r\nCan we say that Africans are exaggerating when \r\nthey complain about the ineffectiveness of the world \r\norder and about the fact that their continent is suffering \r\nfrom an economic order that perpetuates poverty and \r\ninequality, continually creates social and political \r\ncrises and provides no prospects for progress and \r\ndevelopment? I raise those questions at a time when \r\nEgypt is chairing the Group of 77 and China, whose \r\nmember States make up a majority of the population of \r\nthis planet and therefore have an enormous interest in \r\nenhancing the role of the United Nations. Developing \r\ncountries cannot afford to exist in an international order \r\nthat is not governed by laws and the lofty principles \r\non which the United Nations was founded, or in one \r\nthat can be polarized and subjected to attempts by some \r\nto dominate it and impose their will on the rest of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nLet me sum up Egypt’s vision in three key \r\nprinciples to which we ought to renew our commitment, \r\nand three causes to which we must accord priority if the \r\nUnited Nations is to regain its effectiveness and role. \r\nThe first principle is that there is no way to achieve \r\nan effective international order if its main constituent \r\nunit, the nation State, which is premised on the notions \r\nof citizenship, democracy and equality, is threatened \r\nwith disintegration. I speak based on Egypt’s unique \r\nexperience. The Egyptian people have made tremendous \r\nefforts to restore their State and save their identity. \r\nThey chose the capable and just nation State as the \r\npathway to reform in order to achieve their aspirations \r\nfor freedom, development and dignity.\r\nThe disintegration of nations as a result of civil \r\nstrife and regression to sectarian loyalty rather \r\nnational identity is responsible for the most dangerous \r\nphenomena in our contemporary world, such as \r\narmed conflicts, human trafficking, illegal migration, \r\norganized crime and the illicit trade in arms and drugs.\r\nThere is no doubt that the Arab region is one of \r\nthe most vulnerable in the world to the dangers of the \r\ndisintegration of nation States and the ensuing creation \r\nof a fertile environment for terrorism and worsening \r\nsectarian conflict. Preserving and reforming the \r\nfoundation of the State is therefore a fundamental \r\npriority of Egypt’s foreign policy in the Arab region. \r\nThere can be no way out of the crisis in Syria or the \r\nplight of Yemen except by restoring the nation State \r\nand preserving its sovereignty and institutions, as well \r\nas realizing the legitimate aspirations of its people. \r\nEgypt fully supports a United Nations-led political \r\nsolution in those two brother countries and rejects any \r\nexploitation as a means to achieve regional intervention \r\nor foster an environment for terrorism, extremism and \r\nsectarianism. That same principle applies to our policy \r\non Libya, where Egypt is playing a pivotal role in \r\nsupport of rebuilding the State, especially with respect \r\nto the unification of the Libyan armed forces so that \r\nthey can be capable of defending Libya and countering \r\nthe dangers of terrorism.\r\nWe must not forget that a year has already passed \r\nsince the adoption of the United Nations initiative on \r\nLibya, which seeks to comprehensively address the \r\nLibyan crisis. To date, no progress has been made in \r\nits implementation, which means we must renew our \r\ncommitment to reaching a political solution, as per \r\nall the elements of the initiative. There is no room \r\nfor partial solutions in Libya, Syria or Yemen. Major \r\ncrises require comprehensive approaches, not partial \r\nsolutions, if we are to halt the loss of life and resources \r\nand begin the construction phase.\r\nThe second principle is a commitment to peaceful \r\nand sustainable solutions to international conflicts. \r\nThat is the raison d’être of the United Nations. Yet \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 9/49\r\ndespite the efforts of the United Nations in numerous \r\nconflicts, such as those in South Sudan, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and Mali, so far it has undoubtedly \r\nfallen short of finding permanent settlements for them. \r\nThere is also an urgent need to mobilize resources to \r\nhelp countries in post-conflict situations rehabilitate \r\ntheir institutions and begin reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment. The fundamental issue here is translating \r\nthat principle into tangible support for national efforts \r\nto overcome conflicts and build States in accordance \r\nwith their priorities, while avoiding the imposition \r\nof alien models of governance and development or \r\ninterfering in the internal affairs of States and violating \r\ntheir sovereignty.\r\nWe cannot talk about the settlement of disputes \r\nas a founding principle of the United Nations and an \r\nindicator of its credibility without addressing the \r\nPalestinian question, which is a perfect example of the \r\nfailure of the international system to find a just solution \r\nbased on international legitimacy and the United \r\nNations resolutions that guarantee the establishment of \r\na Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital. \r\nThe terms of reference of a just solution and the \r\nparameters of a final settlement are well known. There \r\nis no time to waste on that debate. What is required \r\nis the political will to resume negotiations and achieve \r\na settlement in accordance with those premises. Let \r\nme repeat what I have said in previous years at this \r\nrostrum — Arabs continue to extend a hand for peace. \r\nOur peoples deserve to turn this tragic page in history.\r\nThe third principle is a commitment to achieving \r\ncomprehensive and sustainable development as a \r\nnecessary precondition for a stable world order and the \r\nbest way for preventing armed conflict and humanitarian \r\ncrises. While we welcome the consensus reached on the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we note \r\nthat the implementation of the Goals in that ambitious \r\nplan require us to address the problem of financing \r\nfor development. That can be achieved by creating an \r\ninternational environment that enables the free f low of \r\nresources necessary for development without imposing \r\nany conditions, while supporting national efforts to \r\nmobilize financing for development. The reform of the \r\nglobal economic and financial architecture cannot be \r\ndelayed. We look forward to seeing the United Nations \r\nserve as a platform for developing ideas to achieve \r\nthis reform, particularly with regard to the creation of \r\nmechanisms that would help to prevent illicit financial \r\nf lows out of developing countries and facilitate the \r\nreturn of such vital assets to their rightful owners.\r\nThe international commitment to the preservation \r\nof the nation State, the peaceful settlement of disputes, \r\nstrengthening cooperation to achieve comprehensive \r\ndevelopment and address imbalances in the global \r\neconomic system are all necessary conditions for any \r\nserious consideration of the revitalization of the United \r\nNations system and the restoration of its credibility. In \r\norder to implement these three principles, three priority \r\ncauses must also be addressed in order to ensure \r\nthe credibility and the future of the United Nations \r\nOrganization and the international order as a whole.\r\nFirst, we need to strengthen partnerships between \r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations. Here \r\nI would like to point to the successful experience \r\nof cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union (AU) as a model to be followed. That \r\nwould help to share the burdens and enable us to \r\nbenefit from the comparative advantages of both \r\nparties in order to address the complex challenges in \r\nour region. The main aim of the international efforts is \r\nto maintain and build peace and provide humanitarian \r\nand developmental assistance.\r\nEgypt is poised to assume the presidency of \r\nthe African Union in 2019 and looks forward to \r\nstrengthening the strategic partnership between \r\nthe African Union and the United Nations through \r\nprogrammes that have a real impact on the continent \r\nand by building on gains made in order to consolidate \r\nthe African Union post-conflict reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment policy. Egypt is alo host to the AU Center \r\nfor Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development and \r\nthe counter-terrorism centre for the regional community \r\nof Sahel-Saharan States.\r\nSecondly, we must continue our efforts to implement \r\nthe initiative launched by Egypt during its membership \r\nof the Security Council to put in place a comprehensive \r\ninternational framework to develop policies and bolster \r\ncooperation in countering terrorism. In that context, \r\nwe welcomed the Secretary-General’s initiative \r\nto convene the High-level Conference of Heads of \r\nCounter-Terrorism Agencies of Member States in June, \r\nfollowing the periodic review of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\r\nAs the Assembly is well aware, early this year \r\nEgypt launched its comprehensive Sinai 2018 operation \r\nto combat and decisively eradicate terrorism through \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n10/49 18-29775\r\na strategy that addresses its security, ideological and \r\ndevelopment aspects. Based on that experience and \r\non Egypt’s overall experience in supporting counter-\r\nterrorism efforts in the Middle East and North Africa, I \r\ncan assure the Assembly that the level of financing, the \r\nsophisticated arms and training, as well as the means \r\nof communication obtained by those extremist groups, \r\nas well as the ease of movement and travel of foreign \r\nterrorist fighters, point to the inevitable need to develop \r\na global system to combat terrorism wherever it exists \r\nand to cut its sources of support in every possible way.\r\nThirdly, we must address the shortcomings in the \r\ninternational community’s handling of human rights \r\nissues. The credibility of the United Nations cannot \r\nbe restored as long as millions continue to suffer from \r\nextreme poverty, live under foreign occupation or fall \r\nvictim to terrorism and armed conflict. Human rights \r\nwill not be protected through media defamation, the \r\npoliticization of human rights mechanisms or the \r\nfailure to equitably address all issues of human rights, \r\nincluding economic, social and cultural rights.\r\nEgypt has a solid constitutional foundation for the \r\nprotection of all human rights. Major strides have been \r\nachieved in the area of the empowerment of women \r\nand young people. Women now hold 25 per cent of the \r\nministerial posts and more than 15 per cent of seats \r\nin Parliament. We rely on young people in all leading \r\npositions in the country, while the international youth \r\nconferences that are held annually in Egypt have also \r\nbecome a regular forum for them to communicate and \r\nraise their concerns and priorities. We are determined \r\nto continue to accord high priority to the issues of \r\nwomen’s economic empowerment, youth, science, \r\ntechnology and innovation during Egypt’s presidency of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, as a practical demonstration \r\nof our commitment to the comprehensive promotion of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nEgypt, like the vast majority of the world’s peoples \r\nand nations, has a vested interest in restoring the \r\ncredibility of international multilateral action with \r\nthe United Nations at its forefront. We believe that \r\nthe Organization can overcome scepticism about its \r\nmerits and credibility by restoring the lofty principles \r\non which its Charter was premised and by acting in \r\naccordance with the priorities I have addressed, which \r\nreflect the aspirations of our peoples. Only then will \r\nour Organization reclaim its credibility and our peoples \r\nregain their confidence in a future of peace, cooperation \r\nand respect for one another.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Egypt for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, President of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mario Abdo Benítez, President of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Mario Abdo \r\nBenítez, President of the Republic of Paraguay.\r\nMr. Mario Abdo Benítez, President of the Republic \r\nof Paraguay, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mario Abdo Benítez, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Benítez (spoke in Spanish): It is a great \r\nhonour and privilege for me to address the Assembly for \r\nthe first time at the beginning of my tenure as President \r\nof the Republic of Paraguay.\r\nParaguay has always shown its unconditional \r\nsupport for the United Nations system and will continue \r\nto unwaveringly assume its commitments as a Member \r\nof the Organization, as well as its active responsibility \r\nbased on the principles that we all recognize — freedom, \r\njustice, national sovereignty, independence and the \r\nintegrity of States. My nation has a deep sense of \r\nequality based on the recognition of human dignity. We \r\nreject violence and intolerance and love peace. Ours \r\nis a society of diverse cultures. It is bilingual, capable \r\nof overcoming difficulties self lessly and responsibly, \r\nwhich requires integrity and righteousness, the civic \r\nvalues intrinsic to democracy.\r\nWe are very pleased that the most democratic and \r\nrepresentative body of our Organization is being led \r\nby a woman who is also Latin American. We offer our \r\ncongratulations and best wishes for success to the new \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés. We also salute Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres, who is doing an excellent job leading \r\nthe institution. We reiterate our absolute confidence in \r\nand support for his management.\r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 11/49\r\nWe offer our posthumous tribute to the former \r\nSecretary-General and Nobel Peace Prize laureate \r\nthe late Kofi Annan. He was an extraordinary leader, \r\nhumanist and promoter of peace who took pains to \r\nensure that the Organization serves the peoples as well \r\nas the States.\r\nIn an increasingly interconnected and \r\ninterdependent world that is evolving at an accelerated \r\npace, collectively addressing global challenges is \r\nan unavoidable responsibility of the international \r\ncommunity. The General Assembly must continue to \r\nbe strengthened, as it is the voice of the nations of the \r\nworld. The Security Council must be reformed with a \r\nview to making it more democratic and inclusive so as \r\nto fulfil the mandate of maintaining international peace \r\nand security for this and future generations. Paraguay \r\nadvocates adding more developing countries so as to \r\nbalance the membership of the Council, as well as \r\ntotally eliminating the veto, a privilege that no longer \r\ncorresponds to the political reality of our times.\r\nThe Republic of Paraguay has strongly supported \r\nthe reforms promoted by the Secretary-General in \r\nthe pillars of development, peace and security, and \r\nmanagement. We believe that those efforts have been \r\nsuccessful and that they have been deployed at the \r\nright time, since in order to face the challenges posed \r\nby sustainable development, we must have an efficient, \r\ntransparent Organization that has the capacity to \r\nsupport countries in the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, particularly \r\ncountries with special needs and challenges, such as \r\nlandlocked developing countries.\r\nThe poverty that is currently affecting millions \r\nof human beings is due to the poor distribution of \r\ngoods rather than their scarcity. As leaders it is our \r\nresponsibility to stop viewing poverty simply as an \r\neconomic indicator and instead to see it as a human \r\nproblem. In our view, ignoring the human aspect when \r\nwe speak about poverty is going against the principles \r\nthat this institution and our democracies represent.\r\nOur Government is committed to making social \r\npolicies more far-reaching and intensifying our \r\nsupport to human development by improving the \r\ndemocratization of access to education, health care and \r\ndignified employment. That is the way forward, in both \r\nthe medium and long terms, to achieving greater social \r\nequity and collective prosperity. We are especially \r\nfocusing on young people, who have extraordinary \r\npotential to help transform Paraguay and the world. We \r\nmust take advantage of the opportunity that demography \r\nhas given us to lay solid foundations for a better future. \r\nWith that purpose in mind, we are initiating a process for \r\nthe profound transformation of our education policies \r\nthat will enable us to bring children and young people \r\ninto the education system, with a special emphasis on \r\ntraining teachers and professors.\r\nWe are going to install and consolidate a social \r\nprotection system that addresses people’s entire lives. \r\nParaguay must protect its people from conception to old \r\nage. There are many pending issues in the situation of \r\npeople with disabilities and this is a key moment for \r\nParaguay as a nation to promote their rights. We will \r\ngive particular attention to ensuring that our public \r\npolicies are cross-cutting so that we can implement \r\nthem fully. We are also working to promote women as a \r\nfactor for change in our country, creating the conditions \r\nnecessary for equity, equality and empowerment. With \r\nthe support of our mothers, wives and daughters, we \r\nfirmly believe that we can create a better country and \r\nsociety. And our indigenous peoples occupy a special \r\nplace in our Government. It is time for the State to \r\nshoulder the task of creating better living conditions \r\nfor them. That is a moral obligation.\r\nParaguay is deeply concerned about the scourge \r\nof terrorism and believes that there can never be any \r\njustification for the use of violence as a means to \r\nan end. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations and reaffirm that the fight against \r\nterrorism and the protection of human rights are not \r\nopposing goals but rather complement and mutually \r\nreinforce one another. We continue to work relentlessly \r\nwith allied countries to fiercely fight every form of \r\ncrime. We cannot accept the possibility that our borders \r\ncan become places where criminal organizations can \r\nthrive. In the few weeks since my presidential term \r\nbegan, we have carried out some operations that have \r\nproduced very positive results in the fight against \r\ndrug trafficking and have shown through our political \r\nwill that we are determined not to give up under \r\nany circumstances. International drug trafficking \r\nis accustomed to believing itself untouchable and is \r\nconstantly seeking power. I have promised my people, \r\nand today I pledge it before the entire international \r\ncommunity, that we will not allow that to happen. We \r\nwill continue fighting and working alongside every \r\nState to eradicate these criminal networks.\r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n12/49 18-29775\r\nAs a priority, climate change is unquestionably \r\na global challenge. We States have a crucial decision \r\nin our hands — we can slow climate change and deal \r\nwith its consequences, or deny it and continue making \r\nit worse. With its adoption of the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change in 2015, the international community \r\ndecided to work together to combat climate change, \r\nwithout ignoring the historical responsibility that the \r\nmost highly developed nations have for the production \r\nof greenhouse gases. The issue of environmental \r\nresponsibility is shaping Paraguay’s vision for strategic \r\ndevelopment. We generate more renewable energy per \r\ncapita than any other country on the planet, and we are \r\nalso a major exporter of that energy. At the same time, \r\nwe also intend to expand and improve our national and \r\nregional power systems.\r\nDemocracy has been consolidated in many \r\ncountries, but we have the obligation to adequately \r\naddress the demands of a people who are impatient with \r\ninstitutions whose legitimacy has been jeopardized \r\nby corruption, inequality and inefficiency in the face \r\nof urgent need. The citizens of Paraguay — indeed, \r\nthe citizens of the world — have woken up. Their \r\nvoices resound in our streets, calling for us to tackle \r\ncorruption and impunity, and it is our obligation to \r\nlisten to them and not ignore their just demands. In my \r\ncountry, we understand that dialogue and convergence \r\nare fundamental tools for major reform of the judicial \r\nsystem, which is a priority for us. Judicial security and \r\nthe efficacy of justice are a nation’s pillars. Without \r\njustice there can be no order, and without order chaos \r\nreigns, and in chaos there can be no peace or social \r\ndevelopment. I firmly believe in our institutions and in \r\nthe importance of reforming and strengthening them so \r\nthat they respond to our societies’ current and future \r\nneeds. Only with strong institutions and systems can \r\nwe ensure the growth of our democracies.\r\nParaguay is one of the most open economies in the \r\nworld. We understand that interaction with the world \r\nis an essential element for development. We consider \r\nalliances to be an essential way of improving global \r\nintegration. Our country is firmly committed to full \r\nregional integration and aspires to build it in full \r\nrespect for the sovereignty and independence of each \r\nof the Latin American and Caribbean peoples. But we \r\ncannot ignore the fact that dictatorial regimes that rob \r\ntheir own populations of their happiness, hopes, dreams \r\nand human rights persist on our continent. We want to \r\nexpress our solidarity with the peoples of Venezuela \r\nand Nicaragua in the face of the abuses of power in their \r\ncountries. We firmly believe that despite our differences, \r\nour region must work together to create the wealth and \r\nshare the prosperity that will benefit our peoples. The \r\npursuit of ideologies as an act of fanaticism or a way to \r\nassert superiority must be eradicated. Our goal should \r\nbe to work for the greater good, while respecting our \r\ndifferences, and for the benefit of our communities.\r\nEvery country faces individual challenges on its \r\npath to sustainable development, but the international \r\ncommunity has acknowledged that the most vulnerable \r\ncountries — including landlocked developing \r\ncountries, whose geography creates special needs and \r\nchallenges — require special attention. Those needs \r\nand challenges make themselves felt mainly in the area \r\nof trade. Paraguay has chaired the Group of Landlocked \r\nDeveloping Countries for two years and has made a \r\npriority of the implementation of the Vienna Programme \r\nof Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for \r\nthe Decade 2014-2024, which is an integral part of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and urges \r\nStates, particularly our trading partners and countries \r\nof transit, to take the Programme of Action into \r\ndue consideration.\r\nWe believe that the Arms Trade Treaty and the \r\nTreaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons represent \r\nmajor steps towards disarmament and non-proliferation. \r\nThe Republic of Paraguay reaffirms its commitment \r\nto peacekeeping operations under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations, in its belief in the importance \r\nof contributing to the achievement of the purposes \r\nand principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Paraguayan military and police personnel, \r\nduly trained prior to deployment, are currently serving \r\nin various United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\naround the world.\r\nParaguay respects international law. All of my \r\nGovernment’s decisions are based on its principles, \r\nand we faithfully implement all General Assembly and \r\nSecurity Council resolutions. My country supports \r\nTaiwan’s legitimate request to be included in the \r\nUnited Nations system and believes that Taiwan can \r\nmake a major contribution to our work. This is all \r\nbased on the principle of universality that characterizes \r\nour Organization.\r\nThis year, we will adopt two historic agreements, \r\nthe global compact for safe, orderly and regular \r\nmigration and the global compact on refugees. Paraguay \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 13/49\r\nhas actively participated in the negotiations on both \r\ndocuments, which seek to reach agreements that benefit \r\nrefugees and migrants equally, as well as the countries \r\nand communities from which they come, through which \r\nthey transit and to which they go.\r\nIn 1958, Paraguay launched the World Friendship \r\nCrusade, an endeavour that has deeply moved our \r\npeople. In May 2011, the General Assembly decided \r\nto support that initiative by declaring 30 July as the \r\nInternational Day of Friendship. I urge the leaders \r\nof all Member States of the Organization to promote \r\nfriendship as a noble and valuable sentiment in the lives \r\nof human beings.\r\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, a milestone in \r\nthe history of humankind that enabled us to recognize \r\nformally and for the first time that all people have \r\nfundamental rights by virtue of their human condition, \r\nwithout distinction based on race, sex, nationality, \r\nreligion or any other condition. Paraguay reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to the Declaration and emphasizes that the \r\nUnited Nations must continue to play a fundamental \r\nrole in ensuring the full enjoyment of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms for all.\r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment was an enormously important \r\ncommitment. It represents the beginning of a process \r\nof restructuring aimed at transforming the growth \r\nparadigms of today’s generations and ensuring the well-\r\nbeing of those of the future. The success of that new \r\nglobal agenda depends on the commitment of States and \r\non international solidarity. We therefore call for that \r\nglobal partnership to mobilize the resources necessary \r\nfor its full implementation, including technology \r\ntransfers, knowledge-sharing and capacity-building, \r\nparticularly as they relate to developing countries. \r\nIn fulfilment of the commitment Paraguay made on \r\n25 September 2015, we presented our first voluntary \r\nnational review of the progress we have made in the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda at the High-level \r\nPolitical Forum on Sustainable Development in July.\r\nIn the face of an international scenario characterized \r\nby political uncertainty and economic volatility, we \r\nneed collective and comprehensive strategies with a \r\nsense of shared responsibility. That is why it is vital \r\nthat we decide whether we can allow States to impose \r\nthemselves and obtain the greatest advantage they can \r\nfrom their position, or whether we should work actively \r\nfor stability and common peace by strengthening \r\nmultilateral instruments and mutual cooperation. \r\nThe United Nations Organization is a continuing \r\nwork-in-progress. We must all maintain a constant and \r\nunalterable commitment to working on strengthening \r\nit and building its capacity to adapt and respond to the \r\ncommon challenges facing humankind. May God bless \r\nour nations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Paraguay for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mario Abdo Benítez, President of the Republic \r\nof Paraguay, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mauricio Macri, President of the \r\nArgentine Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Argentine Republic.\r\nMr. Mauricio Macri, President of the Argentine \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mauricio Macri, President \r\nof the Argentine Republic, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Macri (spoke in Spanish): I would like \r\nto congratulate the President on her election to lead this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. I am sure that her work \r\nwill attest to the pertinence of women’s leadership.\r\nIt is an honour to return to the General Assembly \r\nto share our vision for the stage we are currently going \r\nthrough in Argentina and to ratify our commitment to \r\nmaking our country a protagonist that is fully integrated \r\ninto the world. Our country is undergoing a period of \r\nprofound change. We are determined to experience it \r\nwith humility, while accepting the difficulties we face, \r\nand in our belief that we are making the right efforts. I \r\nknow that the efforts required are great, and I want to \r\nthank every Argentine for that. We knew it would not \r\nbe easy, because we are making changes without taking \r\nshortcuts or compromising our future. We are building \r\na consensus for equitable and sustainable development. \r\nTwo years ago, I shared here for the first time my view \r\nof Argentina as a reliable partner of the international \r\ncommunity and a good-faith mediator of regional and \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n14/49 18-29775\r\ninternational politics (see A/71/PV.8). Today I would \r\nlike to renew that vision.\r\nSince I took office as President, we have been \r\ncommitted to an intelligent integration into the world, \r\nbased on the value of our region, Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean. We are a zone of peace, with young \r\npopulations full of talent and vitality and with abundant \r\nresources and natural reserves. We are working for \r\ngreater integration among ourselves and with the rest \r\nof the world. That is evidenced by the willingness for \r\ndialogue and cooperation between the countries of \r\nthe South American Common Market and the Pacific \r\nAlliance. We seek to have a positive impact on the world \r\norder of the twenty-first century. From the South, we \r\ntake an optimistic view that ponders the opportunities \r\nand challenges of globalization. Intelligent integration \r\nis also part of our contribution to building a region and a \r\nworld order that are stable and inclusive and that respect \r\nour values of peace, democracy and human rights.\r\nI would therefore like to take a moment once \r\nagain to express our concern regarding the human \r\nrights situation in Venezuela. Given its seriousness, \r\nArgentina wants to refer the situation of the Venezuelan \r\ndictatorship’s crimes against humanity to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. I call on Venezuela to \r\nacknowledge the humanitarian crisis so that we can use \r\ninternational cooperation to address the health and food \r\ndeprivation of displaced persons. We are part of a broad \r\nregional response that seeks to mitigate the difficulties \r\nof millions of Venezuelans in the wake of their exodus \r\nfrom their country by taking them in and integrating \r\nthem into society. Argentina has already received \r\n130,000 Venezuelans.\r\nFor decades we have convened here to safeguard \r\ninternational peace and security. However, we live in \r\na world that is not immune to serious threats such as \r\norganized crime, cybercrime and terrorism, which \r\nrequire cooperative responses if they are to be dealt \r\nwith. In recent years, with political will and greater \r\ncooperation with our partners in the region and the \r\nworld, we have managed to increase the quantity of \r\ndrugs seized, dismantle criminal drug-trafficking \r\nnetworks, catch more national and international \r\nfugitives and reduce homicides related to drug \r\ntrafficking throughout our country. At the same time, \r\nwe continue to seek the necessary consensus to design \r\na complementary judicial authority at the regional level \r\nand thereby combat organized crime collectively.\r\nArgentina condemns terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations. We suffered directly from two very \r\nserious terrorist attacks, in 1992 and 1994, which claimed \r\nthe lives of 107 people and left hundreds wounded. \r\nOur country will not cease its efforts to bring all those \r\ninvolved in the attacks before Argentine courts so that \r\nthey can be tried and ultimately sentenced. In that regard, \r\nconsidering that next year will mark 25 years since the \r\nattack on the Argentina Israeli Mutual Association, I \r\nshould like once again to ask the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran to cooperate with the Argentine judicial authorities \r\nto advance investigations into the most brutal terrorist \r\nattack we have ever experienced on our territory. We \r\ncall on countries that are friendly to Argentina to assist \r\nus by not harbouring under diplomatic immunity any \r\nof the accused for whom international arrest warrants \r\nand INTERPOL red notices have been issued. Here I \r\nwould also like to remember the five Argentines who \r\nwere killed on 31 October 2017 in this city. My heart is \r\nwith the families of the victims, as well as all victims of \r\nbarbaric acts of terrorism around the world.\r\nArgentina maintains a strategic vision for the \r\nSouth Atlantic, where we seek to peacefully develop \r\nan active policy on resources, the environment and \r\nscience, which includes the question of the Malvinas. I \r\nshould like to reaffirm once again before the Assembly \r\nthe legitimate and imprescriptible sovereign rights of \r\nArgentina over the Malvinas, South Georgia and the \r\nSouth Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime \r\nareas. I should also like to reaffirm my Government’s \r\ncommitment to this new phase in relations with the \r\nUnited Kingdom, based on building mutual trust and a \r\nbroad and positive dialogue.\r\nArgentina is a country with a democratic and \r\nmultilateral identity. Multilateralism is fundamental \r\nto highlighting our national interests and seeking \r\nconsensus. We maintain our firm commitment to the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, which we \r\nestablished as pillars of our Government’s policy on the \r\neradication of poverty, combating climate change and \r\nachieving gender equality.\r\nArgentina has been demonstrating its willingness \r\nto contribute to strengthening global governance. \r\nWe hosted the World Trade Organization Ministerial \r\nConference last year, where it was made clear that there \r\nis a future after the meeting in Buenos Aires. In 2019, \r\nwe will host the second High-level United Nations \r\nConference on South-South Cooperation. We will also \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 15/49\r\nbe preparing to chair the 2020 Review Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, reaffirming our historic commitment \r\nto non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. We are \r\npresiding over the Group of Twenty (G-20) this year in \r\na spirit of unity and a constant quest for consensus.\r\nThe results being achieved give us reason for \r\nenthusiasm. In every working group and ministerial \r\nmeeting a sense of collective commitment is prevailing, \r\nas was true of the Trade and Investment Ministerial \r\nMeeting, where a willingness to revitalize the \r\nmultilateral trading system was expressed. The first \r\nG-20 leaders summit to take place in South America \r\nwill be held on 30 November in Buenos Aires. With \r\nthe support of our partners, the G-20 will once again \r\ndemonstrate its validity and relevance.\r\nThe international community is facing challenges \r\nthat require effective and efficient compromises. \r\nThey demand solutions reached through dialogue \r\nand consensus-building. The theme for this session \r\nof the Assembly emphasizes leadership and shared \r\nresponsibilities for achieving equitable, sustainable and \r\npeaceful societies. Argentines are committed to doing \r\ntheir part to make them a reality.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Argentine \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mauricio Macri, President of the Argentine \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alain Berset, President of the \r\nSwiss Confederation\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Swiss Confederation.\r\nMr. Alain Berset, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alain Berset, President of \r\nthe Swiss Confederation, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Berset (spoke in French): It is a great \r\nprivilege for me to stand before the General Assembly \r\ntoday in New York. We are gathered here because of \r\nthose who believed, following the tragedy of the Second \r\nWorld War, that an international order based on rules \r\nand dialogue, rather than on relationships of power, \r\nwould lead us to peace and prosperity. They were right. \r\nGiven the considerable challenges and transformations \r\nwe must face in the world today, no person or country \r\nhas the capacity to stand alone. By that I mean \r\nglobalization, inequality, war and internal conflict, as \r\nwell as extremism, migration f lows and climate change, \r\nand even health crises and the digital revolution. It is \r\nour shared responsibility — the responsibility of each \r\nand every State Member of the United Nations — to \r\nensure that international institutions and organizations \r\nare up to the task of supporting us in this endeavour. \r\nUnfortunately, there seems to be a tendency at the \r\nmoment to seek the answers to these problems in \r\nnationalist isolation and in increasing mistrust with \r\nregard to cooperation between States.\r\nWe are seeing a new international order take shape, \r\nwith new actors and a new middle class. According to \r\nthe World Bank, between 1990 and 2015 — in a single \r\ngeneration — the number of people affected by extreme \r\npoverty fell from 2 billion to 700 million, a result \r\nthat can be described as exceptional. What is of great \r\nconcern to us today, however, is that these changes have \r\ngone hand in hand with the erosion of the international \r\nsystem founded on the rule of law. I believe that we \r\nare witnessing a real crisis in multilateralism, perhaps \r\nparadoxically at the very moment when we are trying \r\nto forge the main pillars of the global governance of the \r\nfuture. As a country that is interconnected and open \r\nto the world, Switzerland understands the value of a \r\nworking international legal order based on exchange \r\nand multi-stakeholder dialogue, which guarantees \r\nstability and is consistent with Swiss values as they are \r\nset out in our Constitution.\r\nThere are crises currently ongoing in many parts \r\nof the world, some of which have been there for a \r\nvery long time, particularly the Middle East, where \r\nre-engaging in dialogue is the only option. Switzerland \r\nis working for a just and lasting peace between Israelis \r\nand Palestinians in accordance with international law \r\nand the relevant Security Council resolutions, based on \r\na negotiated two-State solution.\r\nThe conflict in Syria has entered its eighth year, \r\nwith no real end in sight. The basic rules and principles \r\nof international humanitarian law and human rights \r\nare not being respected. In recent months the conflict \r\nhas intensified further on various fronts. More than \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n16/49 18-29775\r\n13 million men, women and children in Syria are \r\ndependent on humanitarian aid. It is essential that we \r\nstep up our efforts to find a political solution to the \r\nconflict. Only a negotiated solution that includes all \r\nsectors of Syrian society can guarantee lasting peace \r\nand sustainable reconstruction in Syria and the region \r\nas a whole.\r\nIn Yemen, too, the conflict has been going on for \r\nyears. The armed conflict has deprived millions of \r\npeople of water, food and medical care. Switzerland \r\ncalls on all parties to cease hostilities and come to \r\nthe negotiating table to seek solutions to end this \r\nhumanitarian crisis. In that regard, Switzerland remains \r\nready and willing to play its part — for example, by \r\nhosting peace talks in Geneva under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nLarge-scale health crises accompany all of those \r\nconflicts. The spread of disease, especially in war zones \r\nand refugee camps, is a major burden on weakened or \r\nruined health systems. In that regard, it is vital to protect \r\nhealth-care facilities and personnel in order to maintain \r\nworking health systems and access to medical care.\r\nThe United Nations is truly the cornerstone of \r\npeaceful coexistence between all States, in accordance \r\nwith the rules we have established together. It is \r\nindispensable and, above all, ideally placed to tackle \r\ncontemporary challenges, especially the fight against \r\ninequality. To fulfil that role, the United Nations must \r\nbe strong. If it is to make the maximum impact with the \r\nmeans at its disposal, it must adapt to an ever-changing \r\nenvironment and constantly re-examine its working \r\nmethods. Switzerland is therefore an active supporter \r\nof the reform programmes launched by Secretary-\r\nGeneral António Guterres. Those reforms, in the areas \r\nof peace and security, development and management, \r\naim to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of the \r\nUnited Nations in the face of current global challenges. \r\nWe are engaged on multiple fronts. Today I would \r\nlike to address the following points. I shall begin by \r\naddressing the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nSwitzerland is working actively to implement \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nits 17 Sustainable Development Goals. We have been \r\nworking to put a robust monitoring mechanism in place \r\nto provide for voluntary national reviews and report \r\non progress made towards achieving the Goals. More \r\nspecifically, we have contributed, with other countries, \r\nto providing better statistical data. We are also engaging \r\nwith innovative projects in areas such as health care, \r\neducation, energy and innovation. Nonetheless, we are \r\nall aware that there is still work to be done to combat \r\nglobal warming and the negative environmental impacts \r\nof economic development.\r\nI want to take this opportunity to stress the essential \r\ncontribution of culture and cultural diversity to building \r\na sustainable and successful society. Without a policy of \r\nculture, there is no economic, social or environmental \r\nsustainability. Culture must therefore occupy a central \r\nplace in development policies. In January, more than 30 \r\ncountries reaffirmed culture’s essential contribution to \r\nour lives, as well as the importance of culture overall, \r\nin the Davos declaration.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the Human Rights Council \r\nand the International Criminal Court, respect for human \r\ndignity and fundamental rights is not optional but \r\nrather an obvious necessity for stable and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Switzerland strongly supports the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council and the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, \r\nboth based in Geneva, with a view to enabling them \r\nto fulfil their duty to promote, strengthen and protect \r\nhuman rights in the world. International cooperation is \r\nalso essential in preventing conflict and establishing a \r\nframework for lasting peace. I would like to mention \r\nin particular the fight against impunity. Switzerland \r\nworked for the adoption of the Rome Statute and the \r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, \r\nexactly 20 years ago. We will continue to support that \r\nunique international cooperative effort at the service of \r\nthe victims of the most serious crimes.\r\nThirdly, I would like to speak about Geneva and the \r\ngood offices of Switzerland. We intend to continue to \r\nbuild bridges, support negotiations and mediation and \r\nuse our diplomacy and good offices to help countries and \r\ninternational and regional organizations find solutions \r\nto conflicts and create space for new reflections and \r\nnew topics. In Geneva, Switzerland makes all of the \r\npreparations needed so that discreet peace talks, of \r\nthe kind undertaken by the parties to the conflicts \r\nin Syria and Yemen, can take place. Geneva is also \r\nhome to several United Nations agencies — the World \r\nHealth Organization and the International Labour \r\nOrganization — in addition to numerous international \r\norganizations. Geneva can therefore serve as a platform \r\nfor dialogue on new challenges at the interface between \r\npolitics, society, innovation, science and economy. \r\nI would mention in particular of the areas of Internet \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 17/49\r\ngovernance and digitalization. Those topics develop \r\nand increasingly require synergies and dialogue \r\nbetween the traditional arenas of international action. \r\nHowever, Switzerland’s role is not limited to Geneva. \r\nFor example, we have actively contributed to the process \r\nof negotiating the global compact for safe, orderly and \r\nregular migration, and we are grateful for the trust \r\nplaced in Switzerland in that regard. The management \r\nof migration f lows at the global level is an enormous \r\nundertaking that necessitates the participation of all the \r\nrelevant stakeholders.\r\nMr. Beleffi (San Marino), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nPolicies relying on trade protectionism and selfish \r\ninterests are enjoying a certain popularity at present. \r\nThey would like us to believe that the world is a zero-\r\nsum game and that there are no winners without \r\nlosers. However, today, as in the past, withdrawal, \r\nprotectionism, threats and violence will not provide \r\nanswers to the dysfunctions and disparities of the \r\nworld in which we live. Worse still, such policies can \r\nlead only to a drop in trade and, ultimately, a decline \r\nin prosperity. They nurture mistrust and isolation, \r\nwhich obstruct knowledge-sharing, competition \r\nand innovation. Our world will become all the more \r\nimpoverished, both spiritually and culturally, and we \r\nwill set off alone in search of solutions for problems \r\nthat can only be solved together.\r\nThe current malaise serves as a warning that we \r\nmust do everything we can to prevent a world in which \r\nwe look out only for ourselves, and to encourage a \r\nworld of cooperation between States, in which we \r\nstrive for the common good, for causes such as peace, \r\nsustainable development and environmental protection. \r\nWe can overcome the challenges and causes of growing \r\ninequality, demographic change or migration only if we \r\napproach them with a spirit of mutual trust. All States are \r\nwinners if we see others as potential partners instead of \r\ncompetitors. All States are stronger if the international \r\nsituation is more stable. The world is not a zero-sum \r\ngame. To the contrary, it is a positive-sum game.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alain Berset, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Maithripala Sirisena, President of \r\nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Democratic \r\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\r\nMr. Maithripala Sirisena, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Maithripala Sirisena, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \r\nLanka, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Sirisena (spoke in Sinhalese; English \r\ninterpretation provided by delegation): It is with great \r\npleasure that I stand before the members of the General \r\nAssembly this evening at the seventy-third session \r\nrepresenting Sri Lanka for the fourth time.\r\nSri Lanka, as a State Member of the United \r\nNations, has acted in accordance with treaties and \r\nconventions of the United Nations at all times. For \r\nthe past three and a half years, I have been the Head \r\nof State of Sri Lanka, and today we are quite pleased \r\nwith the progress we have made during my presidency. \r\nI was elected President of Sri Lanka in January 2015. \r\nAt that time, the country’s executive presidency held \r\nexcessive powers. In fact, those powers exceeded those \r\nof a monarch, reaching almost the level of an emperor’s. \r\nHowever, I handed over to the Sri Lanka Parliament \r\nthose excessive powers. It is with pleasure that I inform \r\nthe Assembly of the manner in which I let go of the \r\nexcessive powers of the executive presidency.\r\nDuring the past three and a half years, we have \r\ntaken action to consolidate democracy, human rights \r\nand the fundamental rights of the people. Furthermore, \r\nthe freedom of media and the independence of the \r\njudiciary have been strengthened. That is why I can \r\nstate with dignity that the Sri Lanka we see today is \r\nentirely different from the Sri Lanka of three and a half \r\nyears ago.\r\nI also urgently want to draw the Assembly’s attention \r\nto the fact that as States Members of the United Nations, \r\nwe have certain responsibilities and duties to the world. \r\nFor instance, the United Nations must focus greater \r\nattention on trends in international politics today. \r\nWhen we are talking about such worldwide trends, \r\nthe issue of refugees is a major and very complex one, \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n18/49 18-29775\r\nas we all know. The United Nations, its Members and \r\nmany other organizations today render a great service \r\nin supporting refugees. However, those efforts need \r\nto be more expansive and further strengthened to the \r\nbenefit of refugees.\r\nSri Lanka follows a non-aligned foreign policy and \r\nis one of the most senior members of the Movement of \r\nNon-Aligned Countries. A very successful summit of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement was held in Sri Lanka in \r\n1976. Sri Lanka considers every nation of the world a \r\nfriend. We have no enemies in the world today, and we \r\nare very happy about that.\r\nWith regard to trends in international politics, I \r\nbelieve that the issue of the Palestinian people requires \r\ngreater attention from the United Nations and all world \r\nPowers. Sri Lanka has always supported the freedom \r\nstruggle of the Palestinian people. Many inhumane acts \r\nhave been committed in that region, and I therefore \r\nbelieve that the United Nations and every nation of the \r\nworld must stand strong to prevent them.\r\nAmong the many other problems plaguing the \r\nworld, poverty is a major issue affecting the world’s \r\npopulations today. I believe that the United Nations \r\nmust be more involved in fighting poverty. Hundreds \r\nof millions of people across the world spend their \r\ndays in hunger as a result of income disparities and \r\nclimate change, giving rise to many issues in terms of \r\nalleviating poverty and battling the consequences of \r\nclimate change. In the face of the many challenges that \r\ncause poverty, I believe that major efforts are needed in \r\ncountries heavily affected by climate change in order to \r\nhelp people become prosperous.\r\nAs I said, there are many issues plaguing the \r\nworld. The arms racket, the drug problem and the issue \r\nof illegal pharmaceuticals are also major concerns \r\naffecting society today. I am happy to note that action \r\nwas taken yesterday, with President Donald Trump of \r\nthe United States, and the United Nations, to bring \r\ntogether the nations of the world through the Global \r\nCall to Action on the World Drug Problem. That is \r\nsomething we greatly appreciate. Ending the drug \r\nmenace requires extensive efforts from each and every \r\ncountry, working together with the United Nations.\r\nFurthermore, at the international level, we know \r\nthat the United Nations plays a very important role, \r\nparticularly through the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, which is of huge significance to everything \r\nliving on Earth. As a Member of the United Nations, \r\nSri Lanka ratified the Agreement. I would like to draw \r\nmembers’ attention to the fact that we are committed to \r\ntaking the necessary action on agreed matters under the \r\nParis Agreement.\r\nWhen it comes to Sri Lanka, as I mentioned earlier, \r\nwe have taken action to consolidate democracy and \r\nstrengthen fundamental rights, including human rights \r\nand media rights. I would like to point out that Sri \r\nLanka suffered from a long-drawn-out conflict for 30 \r\nyears. It has now been 10 years since the conflict ended, \r\nduring which time a massive transformation has taken \r\nplace in Sri Lanka, especially during the past three and \r\na half years. The Government in Sri Lanka has taken \r\naction on the post-war situation. We have strengthened \r\nnational reconciliation and taken steps to ensure that \r\nthe war cannot recur, with an extensive programme \r\ncurrently being implemented to achieve that. With \r\nregard to human rights, the Government is continuing \r\nto fulfil its duty to protect the people’s rights and to \r\nseek the support of the United Nations in strengthening \r\nthe programme, which is the course of action that we \r\nwant to follow.\r\nSri Lankan forces were able to defeat one of the \r\nmost brutal terrorist organizations in the world. That \r\nis why Sri Lanka today has emerged strongly as a \r\ncountry that is permanently at peace. Our security \r\nforces defeated a very serious terrorist organization. \r\nHere I would like to very respectfully salute the efforts \r\nmade by the Tri-Forces of Sri Lanka to bring peace \r\nto our country and strengthen its unity. As I said, 10 \r\nyears have now passed since the end of the conflict. I \r\ntherefore encourage the international community not to \r\nthink of Sri Lanka as it did 10 years ago but to view it \r\nfrom a fresh perspective. We suffered a difficult war, \r\nand today permanent peace prevails in our country. \r\nMy Government has been undertaking many actions \r\nto consolidate reconciliation. Human rights are being \r\nprotected and economic prosperity is being achieved \r\nfor a better future for Sri Lankans, and our future as a \r\npeaceful nation therefore deserves to be looked at from \r\na fresh perspective.\r\nI urge the international community to allow Sri \r\nLankans to resolve their problems on their own. A \r\nnation’s independence is of the utmost importance. \r\nBut our humanitarian efforts and our work to \r\nstrengthen democracy require the international \r\ncommunity’s cooperation. If Sri Lanka is to continue \r\nin its commitment to forging ahead in consolidating \r\ndemocracy and protecting human rights, it needs the \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 19/49\r\ninternational community’s attention. As an independent \r\ncountry, we reject any efforts by foreign Powers to \r\nexert influence on us. We appeal to the international \r\ncommunity to give us room to resolve our problems and \r\nto respect the Sri Lankan people’s right to find solutions \r\nto their problems. And while that is something that we \r\nare very willing to do, I would also like to ask for the \r\ninternational community’s cooperation in making that \r\na reality.\r\nWe are working to eliminate fear and suspicion \r\namong the various ethnic groups in our country, and \r\nI believe that with the cooperation of the international \r\ncommunity that can be achieved, not only in Sri Lanka \r\nbut in many other countries of the world. The poor \r\nmust be given priority. The new generation deserves \r\nto be heard. They need to be provided with solutions to \r\ntheir problems.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to cite a verse from Lord \r\nBuddha found in the Salla Sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya \r\nin the Tripitaka, where it is said that a man pierced by \r\nan arrow feels two kinds of pain: first, the physical pain \r\ncaused by the arrow and, secondly, the mental pain \r\nresulting from his anxiety about what has happened. \r\nSimilarly, the people of Sri Lanka have suffered both \r\nthe physical pain of the war and the feelings that it \r\narouses. I therefore urge the international community \r\nto extend its support and cooperation to Sri Lanka.\r\nI thank the Assembly, and may the Noble Triple \r\nGem bless us all.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Maithripala Sirisena, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Borut Pahor, President of the \r\nRepublic of Slovenia\r\nMr. Borut Pahor, President of the Republic \r\nof Slovenia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Borut Pahor, President of \r\nthe Republic of Slovenia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Pahor: It is always an honour to take \r\npart in this great General Assembly.\r\nToday we live in a world where new challenges are \r\nmultiplying and old ones never seem to go away. The \r\nmultilateral system is being challenged. It is a system \r\nthat we have spent more than 70 years building and that \r\nshould prevent humankind from ever again experiencing \r\nthe horrors of war. It is a system that ensures respect for \r\nhuman rights and international law and that promotes \r\nsocial progress, development and better standards of \r\nliving for everybody.\r\nThe case for multilateralism is clear. As Member \r\nStates, we all have the responsibility to find common \r\nsolutions to the common threats and challenges we \r\nface, while protecting the principles and values of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. That spirit of cooperation \r\nand common responsibility must guide our work in the \r\nyears to come. No nation or State will make gains if it \r\nstrives only to assert its own interests.\r\nIn today’s unpredictable world, I urge us all to \r\nunite our efforts to strengthen multilateralism as the \r\nonly viable way to secure peace and security for future \r\ngenerations. My country, Slovenia, stands firm in \r\ndefence of that multilateralism, with the United Nations \r\nat its core. The Republic of Slovenia’s commitment to \r\nthe multilateral system remains as strong as ever, based \r\non shared values, the rule of law and human rights.\r\nWe should all strive to make the United Nations a \r\nstronger and more efficient Organization, reformed in a \r\nway that means it can respond and assist in solving the \r\nmost pressing concerns of our time. Slovenia strongly \r\nsupports the reform efforts by Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres. A lot has been achieved during the \r\npast year, but progress needs to continue.\r\nAt the end of the day, the success of the United \r\nNations reform largely depends on us, the Member \r\nStates. It depends on our political will and ability to \r\ntranslate words into action for the benefit of all of us. \r\nWe hope that will also give fresh impetus to the reform \r\nof the Security Council in order to secure a fairer \r\nrepresentation of today’s world.\r\nOnly a rules-based international order can \r\nguarantee the equality of peoples and nations. If we \r\nwant to create a more stable, peaceful and just future, \r\nMember States must adhere to international law. \r\nRespect for international law and the rule of law is \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n20/49 18-29775\r\na precondition to living in peace and security for all \r\nStates — the entire international community.\r\nGiven that I come from a country adjacent to the \r\nWestern Balkans region, I would like to stress the \r\nimportance of international law and the judgments of \r\ninternational courts in relation to the reconciliation \r\nprocess in that region. Recognizing and accepting \r\nhistorical facts, no matter how painful they are, is \r\nthe basis for stability and progress, both of which are \r\nneeded in the Western Balkans region.\r\nI also wish to emphasize the necessity of full \r\nrespect for human rights, which is always pertinent, \r\nparticularly in today’s world. Without that, there can be \r\nno peace, security or development. The United Nations \r\nhas been instrumental in promoting respect for human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms worldwide, but we \r\nmust not forget that the primary responsibility for their \r\nfulfilment lies, once again, with the State. No State \r\nrights, emergencies or political reasons can ever excuse \r\nthe violations of human rights.\r\nAs the current Chair of the Human Rights Council, \r\nSlovenia remains a strong supporter of human rights \r\nfor all. My country considers it important to ensure \r\nthat the Council contributes to the strengthening of \r\nhuman rights in the world, perhaps now more than ever \r\nbefore. We must all endeavour to ensure the Council’s \r\ncredibility and better effectiveness. We sincerely \r\nhope and expect that the United States of America, a \r\ntraditional promoter and supporter of respect for human \r\nrights around the world, will remain committed to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. Through \r\ndialogue, Slovenia will continue to seek results in the \r\nprocess of strengthening the legitimacy, credibility and \r\neffectiveness of the Human Rights Council.\r\nWar, violent extremism and terrorism always \r\nrepresent an assault on human rights. Those atrocities \r\nshock us to the core of our human conscience. Effective \r\nlaw-enforcement measures are indispensable in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism, but terrorism will never be defeated \r\nby security measures alone. Our endeavours to counter \r\nand prevent terrorism have to be comprehensive, while \r\nalso targeting the root causes of radicalization.\r\nImpunity represents one of the major obstacles to \r\nthe prevention of the grave and systematic violations \r\nof human rights committed against civilians in armed \r\nconflicts. All parties to a conflict, including non-State \r\nactors, must comply with international humanitarian \r\nlaw. Ending impunity is essential to enabling a war-\r\ntorn society to recover from conflict as well as to \r\npreventing future human rights abuses. Slovenia is a \r\nstrong supporter of the International Criminal Court. \r\nWe stress the importance of effective cooperation with \r\nthe International Criminal Court, including by the \r\nSecurity Council, and we invite States that have not yet \r\ndone so to ratify the Rome Statute.\r\nWe must preserve and protect the non-proliferation \r\narchitecture, based on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT), in order to prevent the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including \r\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons. We must \r\nimplement all binding international treaties concerning \r\nweapons of mass destruction, particularly the NPT, \r\nwhose fiftieth anniversary we are celebrating this year.\r\nSlovenia supports resolving our pressing \r\nproliferation issues by diplomatic and peaceful means. \r\nTo that end, we reiterate our support for the Iran \r\nnuclear deal, as long as Iran honours its obligations. We \r\nwelcome the recent developments relating to the Korean \r\npeninsula and hope to see its complete, verifiable \r\nand irreversible denuclearization. Slovenia continues \r\nto support humanitarian demining, mine-victim \r\nassistance and the elimination of unexploded ordnance \r\nand remnants of war.\r\nThe International Trust Fund Enhancing Human \r\nSecurity (ITF), a humanitarian and non-profit \r\norganization, was established two decades ago by \r\nthe Slovenian Government, and its many activities \r\naround the globe — from Bosnia and Herzegovina to \r\nAfghanistan and Colombia — are concrete reflections \r\nof that support. We are grateful to the many States that \r\ncooperate and support the demining work of the ITF.\r\nSlovenia considers international development \r\ncooperation an important element of our overall \r\ninternational endeavours. Through it we support \r\nefforts in partner countries to eradicate hunger, protect \r\nthe environment and contribute to overall sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Through its efforts in the Western Balkans, \r\nthe European neighbourhood and sub-Saharan Africa, \r\nSlovenia is directly contributing to the achievement of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nSlovenia has also taken up the task of implementing \r\nthe 2030 Agenda at the national level and is trying to \r\ncontribute to its implementation at the global level with \r\na sense of urgency. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange are, in our view, two documents that together \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 21/49\r\nprovide a clear path and vision for a more sustainable \r\nfuture for our planet and prosperity for its people. \r\nBy the way, Slovenia ranks eighth out of at least 150 \r\ncountries in realizing the United Nations 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, something I am very \r\nproud of.\r\nToday more than ever before, we need a strong \r\nmultilateral system in which the emphasis must be \r\non acting more collectively, rapidly and effectively. I \r\nwould like to conclude by assuring the Assembly that \r\nSlovenia is committed to supporting the United Nations \r\nand determined to work with all partners to deliver \r\ntangible and meaningful results that will advance \r\npeace, security, development and human rights for all.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Slovenia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Borut Pahor, President of the Republic \r\nof Slovenia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of \r\nthe Republic of Zambia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Zambia.\r\nMr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Lungu: Let me join other world \r\nleaders in congratulating Her Excellency \r\nMs. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session. Zambia fully supports her endeavour to \r\ndiligently discharge her responsibilities in the Assembly. \r\nWe are delighted to note that, after more than a decade, \r\na woman has once again taken up this important seat \r\nas the fourth female President of the General Assembly \r\nsince the establishment of this world body.\r\nAs the United Nations celebrates its seventy-third \r\nanniversary next month, it needs to forcefully continue \r\nto promote international peace, cooperation and the \r\ndevelopment of societies that are free from hunger, \r\npoverty and disease. In doing so, we should endeavour \r\nto explore new ideas and best practices to meet the \r\nexpectations of our people, against a backdrop of the \r\neffective and efficient use of limited global resources. \r\nWe are therefore confident that the President will bring \r\na fresh dimension to the fore as we jointly seek solutions \r\nto the economic, social and political challenges that \r\nconfront us.\r\nSince the founding of the United Nations 73 \r\nyears ago, we believe that Africa should have made \r\nremarkable progress. Yet Africa’s economic structure \r\nhas only minimally changed. That is a concern that \r\nhas been voiced at both continental and global forums. \r\nThe effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and Agenda 2063 of the \r\nAfrican Union therefore presents huge opportunities \r\nfor Africa to revitalize its growth and accelerate its \r\ntransformation. Both frameworks seek to achieve \r\ninclusive growth, sustainable development and peace \r\nand security for the continent.\r\nZambia’s development path is guided by its Vision \r\n2030 through the implementation of its seventh national \r\ndevelopment plan, which is focused on transforming \r\nZambia into a prosperous middle-income country by \r\n2030. To achieve that, we must overcome many hurdles. \r\nOur economy, like many other developing economies, \r\nneeds to diversify. We are therefore determined to \r\naddress our challenges by creating a diversified and \r\nresilient economy that is driven by the agriculture, \r\ntourism and energy sectors, among others. That will \r\nbe supported by a robust infrastructure development \r\nprogramme. In that regard, we need strengthened \r\nand mutually beneficial partnerships in the context \r\nof South-South cooperation, as well as regional and \r\ndevelopment cooperation, which remain crucial to \r\nunlocking diversified growth.\r\nZambia is dedicated to the implementation of \r\nAgenda 2063 of the African Union, the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, including on climate change, \r\nand of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the third \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development. \r\nThat is why my Government has mainstreamed those \r\nglobal development agendas in its seventh national \r\ndevelopment plan.\r\nI am glad to note that my Government has been \r\nmaking steady progress in infrastructure development \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n22/49 18-29775\r\nas a key enabler for recovery and improvement. We \r\nare also implementing several policies and structural \r\nreforms under the Economic Stabilization and Growth \r\nProgramme. As we pursue those goals, we are mindful of \r\nthe challenges in mobilizing financing for development, \r\nas well as declining donor funding, particularly for \r\nleast-developed countries and landlocked developing \r\ncountries. We therefore call on all partners to work with \r\nus to ensure that together we can effectively implement \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals for the good of \r\nour people.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the second United Nations \r\nHigh-level Conference on South-South Cooperation, to \r\nbe held in March 2019 in Buenos Aires, will present \r\nan opportunity to register significant progress on \r\ndevelopment cooperation among the countries of \r\nthe South.\r\nTo turn to the issue of peace, since 1945 the \r\nUnited Nations and the international community have \r\nbeen consistently and strongly advocating the need \r\nfor the preservation and promotion of peace. Recent \r\ndevelopment frameworks have also given prominence \r\nto efforts to protect global peace and security. My \r\nGovernment therefore fully supports Security Council \r\nresolution 2378 (2017), which focuses on peacekeeping \r\nreforms. Zambia is also committed to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Action for Peacekeeping initiative, as set out \r\nin the Declaration of Shared Commitments on United \r\nNations Peacekeeping Operations, sent to Member \r\nStates by the Secretary-General in August.\r\nI am also glad to say that my Government has \r\nrecently increased its participation in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations and is currently a major \r\ncontributor to peacekeeping missions. Zambia is also \r\none of the countries that has taken the lead in increasing \r\nwomen’s participation in peacekeeping operations. We \r\nalso join other Member States in saluting the gallant \r\nmen and women in blue helmets for the sacrifices they \r\nare making to foster peace in the world.\r\nIn our continuing efforts to contribute to regional and \r\nworld peace, Zambia recently took up the chairmanship \r\nof the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security of the \r\nSouthern African Development Community. I can only \r\nassure Member States that we will discharge that duty \r\nwith the utmost dedication to the cause of regional and \r\nworld peace and security.\r\nOn gender equality and women’s economic \r\nempowerment, I want to reaffirm my Government’s \r\ncommitment to eliminating all forms of violence and \r\ndiscrimination against women and girls. We are making \r\nefforts to review and enact new legislation and policies \r\nthat are gender responsive. Progress is also being \r\nrecorded on the implementation of our 50-50 enrolment \r\npolicy, as schools are now compelled by law to enrol \r\nequal numbers of girls and boys.\r\nIn 2017 my Government commenced the \r\ndistribution of free sanitary napkins to girls in rural \r\nand suburban areas in an effort to keep girls in school. \r\nThat programme was introduced in order to improve \r\ngirls’ access to education, as a lack of proper sanitary \r\nnapkins often limits their ability to attend school. In \r\naddition, we have continued to implement the re-entry \r\npolicy for pregnant girls. That programme is a success, \r\nas a number of girls have been retained in school after \r\ngiving birth. We believe that measure is critical to \r\nensuring equal opportunities for our girls. We have \r\nno doubt that those and many other efforts will lay a \r\nfirm foundation for our attainment of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, particularly Goal 5, on gender \r\nequality and women’s economic empowerment.\r\nThe world has continued to witness unprecedented \r\nmass movements of refugees and migrants, which \r\nhas had political, social, economic and human rights \r\nramifications for a number of host countries. Let me \r\nunderscore the importance of collaborative efforts on \r\nthe part of the global community in tackling issues \r\nrelating to the current refugee and migration crisis. \r\nThat will ensure safe, orderly and regular migration \r\ninvolving full respect for human rights and the humane \r\ntreatment of migrants and refugees. We therefore \r\nwelcome the convening in December of the Conference \r\non International Migration and look forward to the \r\nupcoming adoption of the unprecedented global \r\ncompact on safe, orderly and regular migration. We are \r\nhopeful that this will provide us with an opportunity to \r\nimprove global governance on migration and refugees, \r\nas well as to strengthen the contribution of migrants \r\nto sustainable development. In that regard, I want to \r\nunderline the importance of respecting the principle \r\nof shared responsibility for hosting and supporting \r\nthe world’s refugees and migrants. Going forward, I \r\nwant to reaffirm my Government’s commitment to its \r\ninternational obligations under the 1951 Convention \r\nrelating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, \r\nwhereby we will continue to play a meaningful role \r\nin assisting people affected by conflict situations and \r\nother human rights violations.\r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 23/49\r\nI want to recognize the decision by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his team regarding the progress made in \r\nfulfilling his mandate for reform of the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system, United Nations management and \r\nthe peace and security pillar. However, we are deeply \r\nconcerned about the fact that negligible progress has \r\nbeen made on reforming the Security Council. We also \r\nwant to recall that in 2000, during the Millennium \r\nSummit, world leaders called for a speedy and logical \r\nconclusion to the negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. Five years later, at the World Summit, leaders \r\nexpressed concern at the slow pace of progress and \r\nurged that negotiations on Security Council reform be \r\nexpedited. To date, we are still no closer to agreement \r\non a fundamental issue that seeks to make the United \r\nNations truly representative, democratic and effective.\r\nThe year 2019 will mark the fortieth anniversary \r\nsince reform of the Security Council became an item on \r\nthe agenda of the General Assembly. The President of \r\nthe Assembly has been entrusted by world leaders with \r\nleading the process of reforming the Security Council. \r\nWe are therefore hopeful that she will report substantive \r\nprogress by the time we mark the fortieth anniversary \r\nnext year. I want to reiterate that Africa remains \r\nsteadfast and united in its call for two permanent and \r\nfive non-permanent seats on the Security Council. Not \r\nonly is that a matter of common decency involving the \r\ncorrection of a historical injustice, it is also a matter of \r\nrestoring the dignity of Africa, which today remains \r\nthe only continent without permanent representation \r\non the Council. In that regard, we also support the call \r\nfor a non-permanent seat for small island developing \r\ncountries, whose challenges are so unique that it is \r\nimperative that their perspective be incorporated as \r\na new dimension into the United Nations approach to \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Zambia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kabila Kabange (spoke in French): I am \r\nonce again pleased to be speaking from this rostrum, \r\nas I have for several years. I would first like to pay \r\ntribute to a worthy son of the African continent, the \r\nlate Mr. Kofi Annan, who passed on just a few weeks \r\nago, having bequeathed to our Organization a legacy of \r\nexemplary commitment in the service of peace. I would \r\nalso like to salute the unquestionable leadership of the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, in defending \r\na strong multilateralism buttressed by a reformed \r\nUnited Nations. I also extend my warmest and most \r\nsincere congratulations to the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its current session on her election, a clear \r\nrecognition of her experience as a diplomat.\r\nDuring my address to the Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session (see A/72/PV.19), I outlined the internal \r\nsituation in my country from the security point of \r\nview, affirming that thanks to the efforts that have \r\nbeen made, we had succeeded in reversing dangerous \r\ntrends in the central Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand significantly improving the situation there, while \r\nthe outstanding efforts of our defence and security \r\nforces in the north-east had enabled us to contain \r\nterrorist attacks. Today peace has been consolidated \r\nin the centre of the country, demonstrated by how far \r\nwe have come in reintegrating the families that the \r\ndeplorable violence had forcibly displaced towards the \r\ninterior or forced into neighbouring countries.\r\nHowever, the security challenge in the north-east \r\nremains unresolved because of persistent terrorist \r\nactivities that not only affected the area of Beni on \r\n23 September, but have also been a problem for other \r\ncountries in the region. In any case, those attacks, which \r\nconstitute a further challenge to all who are committed \r\nto the defence of a free world without mindless violence, \r\nwill not prevent us from continuing to work for peace \r\nand stability for our country and, above all, for the \r\nsecurity of the electoral process currently under way.\r\nAt the political level, I commended the efforts \r\nof the entire political spectrum in the form of a \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n24/49 18-29775\r\ncomprehensive consensus on the electoral process \r\nwith the ultimate goal of organizing elections. I also \r\nmentioned the progress that has been made in particular \r\nin creating a voting register and ensuring the imminent \r\npublication of the electoral timetable. Despite the \r\nenormous challenges that still plague the electoral \r\nprocess at every level, I can now reaffirm, as I did last \r\nyear, that the timetable for the holding of elections is \r\nirreversibly scheduled for the end of this year. The \r\npolitical situation in my country is therefore becoming \r\nclearer, with all the electoral timetable deadlines kept \r\nso far. Everything will be done to ensure the peaceful \r\nand credible nature of the elections, which is evidence \r\nof the strengthening of the political and economic \r\nstability that the Democratic Republic of the Congo so \r\ngreatly needs for its emergence from crisis.\r\n“Making the United Nations relevant to all people: \r\nglobal leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies” is the \r\ntheme of this year’s session of the General Assembly. \r\nThat suggests an uncompromising view of what we want \r\nfor our Organization and urges every Member State \r\nto value its contribution to improving the universal \r\ncollective. It also urges them to protect the values that \r\nmake the United Nations a bulwark of solidarity, peace \r\nand shared progress in the face of the profound changes \r\nthat have taken place in the international scene and that \r\nhave been marked by the emergence of new development \r\nhubs and the appearance of new threats, some of which \r\nhave global repercussions. That once again reinforces \r\nthe value of shared and engaged reflection on the \r\nreform of our Organization with a view to ensuring its \r\nimproved functioning. However, the effectiveness of \r\nour Organization in that new context also depends on \r\nits ability to preserve the ideals on which the structure \r\nof global equilibrium that emerged in San Francisco \r\nmore than 70 years ago are based.\r\nWe will not be able to make the United Nations an \r\norganization for all if we tolerate or allow to become \r\ncommonplace some Governments’ serious interference \r\nin matters that clearly fall within the purview of \r\ndomestic State policy, in violation of the rules that \r\ngovern our Organization, which represents a grave \r\ndanger. That is why my country denounces and opposes \r\nany interference in the current electoral process, and is \r\ndetermined to finance all of its operational costs. We \r\nalso demand a return to the fundamentals of democracy \r\nand human rights, one of the issues at the root of the \r\nasymmetrical diplomacy that some make excessive \r\nuse of to consciously weaken countries that have \r\nresolutely taken a path towards progress. Although \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo is only 58 years \r\nold, and its democracy only 15 years old, we are proud \r\ntoday to share our experience in that area, both in \r\nthe Human Rights Council and in other regional and \r\ninternational forums. We do it with humility and in a \r\nstraightforward manner, bearing in mind that the road \r\nahead is still long.\r\nLastly, we cannot make the United Nations an \r\norganization relevant for all people, with a view to \r\nachieving sustainable societies, as long as the fauna \r\nand f lora of countries with extensive forestlands \r\nserve only as ornaments — under the well-chosen \r\npretext that they are the lungs of humankind or the \r\nrepairers of the environmental damage caused by \r\nNorthern industries — and if there is no real will to \r\nallocate substantial rewards for those resources to our \r\npopulations, or to make good on commitments that are \r\noften made but never kept.\r\nAlmost 15 years ago, the African continent spoke \r\nwith one voice in asking that Africa be represented by \r\na permanent member in the Security Council, as part \r\nof United Nations reform. Given the myriad changes \r\nover many years and for the sake of equity, which is the \r\nfocus of our meeting here, it is Africa’s wish to speak \r\nwith a louder voice in line with the expectations of its \r\npeoples, who demand greater representation within this \r\nOrganization, which embodies universalism and whose \r\npeacekeeping activities primarily concern our continent. \r\nMoreover, United Nations forces were deployed in \r\nmy country 20 years ago, and my Government now \r\nreiterates its demand, given the fact that the results \r\nat the operational level of the multilateral forces have \r\ndiminished, that the multilateral force effectively and \r\nsignificantly begin its withdrawal.\r\nMr. Renzi (San Marino), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to stress the progress made by \r\nmy country today. Only a few years ago it was mired in \r\nbankruptcy, but it is now showing indisputable signs of \r\nnew ambitions, underscored by encouraging economic \r\nand security policies. Our challenges are by no means \r\nnegligible, but that in no way shakes my faith in a bright \r\nfuture for my country, in which the people understand \r\nhow to overcome their history and robustly commit \r\nto their unity, independence and sovereignty. I would \r\nalso like to assure the Assembly that the Democratic \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 25/49\r\nRepublic of the Congo will always stand by the \r\nOrganization as long as it remains at our side, as the \r\nUnited Nations embodies in the most concrete terms \r\nwhat our collective efforts can achieve in bringing \r\nabout peace and the well-being of our planet. It is \r\nnevertheless up to Member States to work to achieve \r\na stronger Organization by preserving through their \r\nactions the values that inspired its foundation and are \r\nunequivocally aimed at the preservation of humankind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Sooronbai Zheenbekov, President \r\nof the Kyrgyz Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Kyrgyz Republic.\r\nMr. Sooronbai Zheenbekov, President of the \r\nKyrgyz Republic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Sooronbai Zheenbekov, \r\nPresident of the Kyrgyz Republic, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Zheenbekov (spoke in Kyrgyz; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): Let me \r\nwarmly welcome everyone on behalf of the freedom-\r\nloving, ancient Kyrgyz people, with their thousands of \r\nyears of history and great mountains. From this lofty \r\nrostrum of the United Nations, I would like to draw \r\neveryone’s attention to the issues that the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic believes to be urgent and that require joint \r\nsolutions at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels. \r\n(spoke in Russian) \r\nOn behalf of the Kyrgyz Republic, I would like to \r\nsalute  all participants in the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-third session.\r\nThe global political, economic and environmental \r\nsituation is changing rapidly, and the trend towards \r\nregionalism in world politics is increasing. Rising \r\nprices, insufficient liquidity and sanctions wars in \r\neconomies continue. The threat of terrorism and \r\nextremism is everywhere. The preservation of an \r\nenvironmental balance has become a global issue for the \r\nwhole planet. Regardless of their causes, those issues \r\naffect every country, especially small ones with open \r\neconomies. These processes have become sensitive \r\nissues for Kyrgyzstan. I therefore believe that today it \r\nis extremely timely to discuss in the General Assembly \r\nthe relevance of the United Nations to all people, as \r\nwell as the issues of global leadership and mutual \r\nresponsibility for peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties. I would like to take this opportunity from the \r\nhigh tribune of the United Nations to outline the issues \r\nat the national, regional and global levels that are of \r\nrelevance to our country.\r\nThe peaceful transfer of power in the autumn of \r\n2017 laid a solid foundation for Kyrgyzstan’s further \r\nprogressive democratic development. At present, there \r\nis political and social stability in Kyrgyzstan, which \r\nprovides us with the opportunity to set ambitious \r\ngoals for the medium term. Kyrgyzstan supports the \r\ndevelopment of a system of parliamentary democracy \r\nin our country, and the upcoming 2020 parliamentary \r\nelections will attest to that once again. We firmly \r\nbelieve that parliamentary democracy is best suited to \r\nthe nature of our society’s development.\r\nThe fight against corruption remains a priority \r\nfor the State policy of Kyrgyzstan. As of today, we are \r\nfacing the issues of the political modernization and \r\neconomic development that the future will require of us.\r\nFirst of all, we are focusing on implementing \r\njudicial and legal reforms and reorganizing our law-\r\nenforcement agencies. The sustainable development \r\nof every region of Kyrgyzstan is key to successful \r\ndevelopment and is our most urgent issue. We have \r\nset ourselves the goal of improving the climate for \r\ninvestment and have begun building an information \r\nsociety with a fair and transparent public administration. \r\nKyrgyzstan will continue to consistently strengthen \r\ndemocratic principles in developing the State. Our \r\npublic administration is focused on the needs of all \r\nindividuals and on ensuring their rights, freedoms and \r\njustice in society.\r\nAll of these medium- and long-term reforms \r\nare included in Kyrgyzstan’s 2040 national \r\ndevelopment strategy. The long-term provisions of \r\nour national development strategy meet all of the \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n26/49 18-29775\r\nrequirements of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, and in that connection, we hope for \r\nfurther support from the United Nations and partner \r\ncountries for Kyrgyzstan’s development efforts. \r\nKyrgyzstan remains committed to the implementation \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nWe consider strengthening the entire spectrum \r\nof cooperation among the countries of Central Asia a \r\ncrucial factor in ensuring the security not only of the \r\nregion but of the world. We are pleased to note that \r\nour cooperation has gained positive momentum and \r\nreached a fundamentally new level. The meetings of the \r\nHeads of State and Foreign Ministers of the countries of \r\nCentral Asia have become a tradition.\r\nFor the Kyrgyz Republic, the issue of water use \r\nis extremely important. The ways that water and \r\nenergy resources have been used in recent decades \r\nin Central Asia show how essential it is to develop \r\nnew approaches. We believe that the integrated use \r\nof water and energy resources in the region should be \r\ndetermined by a system of measures aimed at achieving \r\nthe sustainable development of all Central Asian States. \r\nKyrgyzstan has therefore consistently advocated for the \r\ndevelopment and implementation in Central Asia of \r\nmutually beneficial economic mechanisms in the area. \r\nCooperation and multilateral dialogue are considered \r\nby the Kyrgyz Republic as the only way to solve existing \r\nchallenges. In that context, we also see a special role \r\nand a new mission for regional organizations such \r\nas the Commonwealth of Independent States, the \r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization, the Collective \r\nSecurity Treaty Organization and the Eurasian \r\nEconomic Union. Ending isolationist policies and \r\ndeveloping the cooperation and partnership have \r\nbecome very important today.\r\nNo State is immune to threats related to terrorism \r\nand extremism. The members of the international \r\ncommunity must work together more actively to \r\ncombat this evil and problems such as drug trafficking, \r\ntrafficking in persons and weapons, money-laundering \r\nand the financing of terrorism. That is very important \r\nto us, as we are located at a crossroads of drug-\r\ntrafficking networks. Regrettably, the measures taken \r\nby the international community are still insufficient. \r\nIt is important to pay special attention to solving this \r\ngeneral problem for the region. Kyrgyzstan reaffirms \r\nits commitment to the effective implementation of the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \r\nand supports the Joint Action Plan. It is essential to \r\ncoordinate the efforts of the States of the region on \r\nissues related to security, improved cooperation and the \r\nexchange of operating information. The Government \r\nof the Kyrgyz Republic has approved a programme \r\nfor combating extremism and terrorism up to 2022. I \r\nthank the United Nations for its financial and technical \r\nassistance in the fight against terrorism and drug \r\ntrafficking, and we hope for further support from \r\ndevelopment partners for security-related issues.\r\nThe move towards sustainable development means \r\nrestoring our natural ecosystems and the environment. \r\nKyrgyzstan recognizes climate change as an existential \r\nthreat to ecosystems and people. We committed to \r\ncounteracting that global threat by signing the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. Climate change is \r\nhaving an ever-increasing impact on our glaciers and \r\nwater resources and contributing to the increase in \r\nnatural disasters in our mountainous regions. Those are \r\nthe main topics of the fourth World Mountain Forum in \r\nKyrgyzstan, held to discuss new paths to development \r\nensuring a prosperous future for mountain regions.\r\nThe main environment-related issue in our region \r\ncontinues to be the legacy of the radioactive materials \r\nindustry of the Soviet era — that is, uranium tailings. \r\nKyrgyzstan has held a number of international \r\nconferences in an effort to find solutions to it. We \r\nheld an event at the United Nations on 27 September \r\ndedicated to the dangers of uranium mining. With the \r\naim of reaching a new stage in action for reclaiming \r\nuranium tailings, Kyrgyzstan is taking the initiative to \r\nupdate resolution 68/218 on the role of the international \r\ncommunity in averting the radiation threat in Central \r\nAsia. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our \r\ndevelopment partners for providing significant support \r\nto my country in solving this problem.\r\nThe issues I have noted require the joint efforts \r\nof all States and of global and regional institutions. \r\nThere is a growing need to create fundamentally \r\nnew international mechanisms, adequate to modern \r\nchallenges and threats. Our Organization needs \r\nchanges to meet the demands of the times and current \r\nrealities. Its reforms should be based on the principles \r\nof universality, broad geographical representation and \r\nthe widest possible support of the States Members of \r\nthe United Nations. Kyrgyzstan seeks to contribute \r\nits fair share of contributions to the common cause \r\nof the United Nations for peace, global security and \r\nsustainable development.\r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 27/49\r\nIn order to draw the attention of the United \r\nNations and the world to the problem of small States, \r\nKyrgyzstan has put forward its candidacy for a seat \r\nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council \r\nfor the period from 2027 to 2028. The support of \r\ncountries that have never had a seat on the Council \r\nwill increase confidence in the equality of its members \r\nand thereby raise and strengthen the authority and \r\ncredibility of the Organization. Kyrgyzstan considers \r\nthe United Nations to be an authoritative and universal \r\ninternational organization.\r\nIt should be emphasized that an important factor \r\nin preserving peace, stability and the development of \r\ncultural diversity and tolerance is the deepening of \r\nintercultural dialogue. That was brilliantly described \r\nin the works of our distinguished and world-renowned \r\nwriter Chingiz Aitmatov. He made a significant \r\ncontribution to building peace and cultural exchange \r\namong different peoples. This year, Kyrgyzstan and the \r\nwhole world are celebrating the ninetieth anniversary \r\nof the birth of Chingiz Aitmatov.\r\nThe initiative of Kyrgyzstan to hold the World \r\nNomad Games on a regular basis has been recognized \r\nand supported by the General Assembly. The Games \r\nhave shown that, despite the complexities and \r\ncontradictions of the modern world, the peoples of the \r\nworld strive for unity and creativity.\r\n(spoke in Kyrgyz)\r\nOur nation considers independence to be its greatest \r\nachievement, and it has found its worthy place in the \r\nworld community. Kyrgyzstan has been recognized as \r\na sovereign State in the international arena. As Chingiz \r\nAitmatov, the great son of the Kyrgyz people and a \r\nfamous writer, philosopher and humanist said, “There \r\nis no greater wealth for man than to live together and \r\nin peace”.\r\nOnly unity and harmony will save the world. \r\nThe unity of the people is the main guarantor of the \r\nsustainable development of our country. Inter-ethnic \r\nfriendship in society and the responsible attitude of all \r\ncitizens to their country’s destiny are the foundations \r\nof success. The independence of Kyrgyzstan and the \r\nunity of its people are our future and happiness. May \r\nGod grant his mercy to the people of Kyrgyzstan and \r\nlet peace reign in our land. I wish every citizen of the \r\ncountry health, good fortune, and a happy and peaceful \r\nlife. Long live our independent Kyrgyzstan.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Sooronbai Zheenbekov, President of the \r\nKyrgyz Republic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Adama Barrow, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Gambia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nthe Gambia.\r\nMr. Adama Barrow, President of the Republic \r\nof the Gambia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Adama Barrow, President \r\nof the Republic of the Gambia, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Barrow: All praise is due to the \r\nAlmighty Allah for granting us the favour of gathering \r\nin the Assembly once again to discuss and advance our \r\ncommon global agenda. Please allow me to begin by \r\nsincerely thanking His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák \r\nfor the excellent manner in which he presided over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session. By \r\nthe same token, I congratulate Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés on her assumption of the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. \r\nI assure her that as one of her Vice-Presidents, the \r\nGambia pledges its full support and cooperation during \r\nher tenure of office.\r\nThe theme of the seventy-third session, “Making \r\nthe United Nations relevant to all people: global \r\nleadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, \r\nequitable and sustainable societies”, is indeed very \r\nrelevant to today’s global affairs. By implication, the \r\npursuit of the mission of the United Nations for peace, \r\ndevelopment and human rights also remains as relevant \r\ntoday as it was in 1945, when it was adopted in response \r\nto the horrific experiences and destruction during that \r\ntragic era. Amid the complex multilateral challenges \r\nthat continue to confront us globally, no country can \r\nthrive or solve all of the challenges it faces in isolation. \r\nAs human beings, our salvation lies in strengthening \r\nour multilateral institutions and fostering greater \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n28/49 18-29775\r\ninternational cooperation in order to collectively \r\naddress global challenges. The United Nations provides \r\na unique opportunity to achieve that goal.\r\nIt is apparent that in order to make real progress, \r\neffective global leadership is imperative. As leaders, we \r\nmust therefore all shoulder our responsibilities as best \r\nwe can. That should compel us to support and invest \r\nmore in the United Nations, instead of withdrawing our \r\nparticipation or cutting back our financial support. It \r\nis ironic that at a time when multiple global challenges \r\nare emerging and mounting, support for the work of the \r\nUnited Nations is being undermined through inadequate \r\nfunding. Those of us who value the United Nations, as \r\nwell as those who have benefited immensely from its \r\nwork, should be at the forefront in calling on all Member \r\nStates to step up support for the Organization. Indeed, \r\nthe United Nations must play a lead role in solving \r\nglobal challenges, and our task is to ensure that it has \r\nthe required capacity, influence and effectiveness.\r\nDecisions and actions rooted in a rules-based \r\ninternational system that is underpinned by multilateral \r\nagreements and processes form the basis for the \r\nsuccessful conduct of relations between and among \r\nnations. Let us therefore restore faith in our rules-\r\nbased international order, so as to remain relevant \r\nand collectively make progress on our global agenda, \r\nranging from tackling the menaces of climate change \r\nand terrorism to addressing disarmament, trade, \r\ndevelopment and other issues of concern to humankind. \r\nI am confident that it is only through effective global \r\nleadership and international cooperation that the well-\r\nbeing of all of the world’s citizens can be achieved. As \r\nleaders, we have the shared responsibility to promote \r\na world order that prioritizes peace over insecurity, \r\neliminates the growing inequalities around the world \r\nand brings us sustainable development.\r\nWith reference to the Gambia and following a \r\ndifficult political impasse in December 2016, Gambians \r\nhave managed, with the support of our partners, to \r\nrestore democracy and the rule of law in our country. \r\nWe have completed our national electoral process in \r\nfull, after successfully conducting both legislative and \r\nlocal Government elections. We are also resolutely \r\npursuing institutional and constitutional reforms. Such \r\nreforms have commenced, with the hope of putting the \r\nGambia on a solid path to becoming a shining champion \r\nof democracy and human rights in the world.\r\nWhen Gambians voted for change in 2016, they \r\nwere yearning to be in charge of their destiny. They \r\nwanted significant, not cosmetic, improvements in \r\ntheir lives. It is for that reason that my Government \r\nis now implementing a comprehensive national \r\ndevelopment plan for the period 2018-2021. The plan \r\nseeks to transform the Gambia through key priorities, \r\nsuch as infrastructure development, agricultural \r\ntransformation, macroeconomic stability, job creation \r\nand employment. The plan also seeks to consolidate our \r\ndemocratic gains through good governance, the rule of \r\nlaw and respect for human and people’s rights. In all, \r\nour goal is to deliver a fully transformed Gambia that \r\nhas a future, a country that is energy secure, food-self-\r\nsufficient and investment-friendly. We have also begun \r\nto exploit and harness the benefits of information \r\nand communication technology as a catalyst for \r\nmodernization and youth empowerment.\r\nOur national development plan was presented \r\nto a successful donor conference in Brussels, where \r\nsignificant pledges were made to help us meet our \r\nfunding targets. I want to once again express our \r\nprofound thanks to our bilateral and multilateral \r\npartners, including the United Nations, the European \r\nUnion, the World Bank and many others, for their \r\ninterest and support. We are indeed truly grateful, \r\nas we look forward to their continued collaboration \r\nand support for our efforts to attain our development \r\nobjectives. The national development plan will \r\ncontinue to be implemented through the partnerships \r\nand solidarity built at the Brussels meeting. Quite \r\ndeliberately, the plan is consistent with the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, as well as the African \r\nUnion’s Agenda 2063.\r\nIn our pursuit of a fully transformed Gambia, we \r\nrecognize the importance of meaningful engagement \r\nwith the Gambian diaspora, fondly referred to as the \r\neighth region of the Gambia. Our diaspora strategy \r\nseeks to explore and utilize the skills, talents and \r\nresources of Gambians everywhere for the successful \r\nimplementation of our national development plan.\r\nThe Gambia’s experience demonstrates that \r\ndemocracy yields amazing dividends. Remarkably, we \r\nhave noticed a decrease in the number of young people \r\nattempting to undertake dangerous journeys across \r\nthe Mediterranean to Europe. The average Gambian is \r\nwilling to stay in the country and contribute to national \r\ndevelopment. Despite those positive developments, I \r\nstrongly urge that interventions to curb youth migration \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 29/49\r\nbe supported through incentives to young people to \r\nstay in their country. In that regard, we look forward \r\nto the high-level conference in Marrakech in December \r\naimed at adopting the new global compact on safe, \r\norderly and regular migration. Better educational and \r\njob opportunities must be harnessed for young people \r\nin order to inspire them and give them hope in life. \r\nIn that regard, my Government stands ready to work \r\ncollaboratively with the United Nations, the African \r\nUnion, the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates and other regional blocs to devise and implement \r\nsuitable strategies and interventions.\r\nAs a member of the Sahel region, the Gambia \r\nfully supports the implementation of the new United \r\nNations Support Plan for the Sahel, anchored in the \r\nUnited Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel. We \r\nare optimistic that it will contribute significantly to \r\naddressing the challenges of development in the Sahel, \r\nas well as to fostering peace, security and cross-\r\nborder relations. We are particularly excited that the \r\nnew strategy views the Sahel as a land of opportunity \r\nand not of hopelessness. Given that fact, we envisage \r\nthat it will yield important dividends for Africa, \r\nespecially with regard to the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity and the elimination of terrorism in the region. \r\nStrategically, we must disrupt all criminal networks \r\nand the financing of criminal sales of organs and body \r\nparts, using better information-sharing and cross-\r\nborder security initiatives.\r\nAs we battle those negative forces and try to fulfil \r\nour aspirations of silencing the guns on the African \r\ncontinent by 2020, we are worried about the state of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions in some of our \r\ntrouble spots, especially in view of the drastic cuts to the \r\npeacekeeping budget. The lack of the critical resources \r\nneeded to support peacekeeping is quite worrisome. \r\nThe Gambia supports the introduction of appropriate \r\nreforms to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations \r\nfor both peacebuilding and peacekeeping, and they \r\nshould be reconsidered and maintained as important \r\npriorities on the Organization’s agenda. My Government \r\nproposes that we do a better job of protecting the lives \r\nnot only of innocent civilians but also of the men \r\nand women who constitute the peacekeepers. At this \r\njuncture, I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute \r\nto all the gallant peacekeepers who have fallen. We call \r\non our partners to rise to the challenge and stop the \r\nprolongation of conflicts, and we therefore support the \r\nSecretary-General’s agenda for reform.\r\nAs Africans, we must assume leadership for \r\nmaintaining peace and security in our continent. In that \r\nrespect, I commend the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea \r\nfor the extraordinary efforts they have made to bring \r\nlasting peace to the Horn of Africa, setting an example \r\nfor the rest of the continent to emulate. Similarly, \r\nI applaud the leaders of South Sudan for agreeing \r\nto restore peace and work towards developing their \r\ncountry. We call on the leaders of Libya and the Central \r\nAfrican Republic to intensify their efforts through \r\npolitical dialogue for national reconciliation and peace.\r\nMy Government reaffirms its strong support \r\nfor a two-State solution to establish peace between \r\nthe Palestinians and their neighbours. We also \r\nunconditionally recognize the One China policy. \r\nSimilarly, we recognize the support provided by the \r\nGovernment and the people of Bangladesh to address \r\nthe plight of the Rohingya Muslims. As the upcoming \r\nChair of the next summit of the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation, the Gambia has undertaken, through a \r\nresolution, to champion an accountability mechanism \r\nthat would ensure that perpetrators of the terrible crimes \r\nagainst the Rohingya Muslims are brought to book.\r\nMr. Bessho (Japan), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nWhile it is our strong desire to see reform that \r\nenables the Secretary-General to operate effectively, \r\nit is equally expected that the reforms also facilitate \r\nthe successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. Reform of the Security \r\nCouncil is long overdue. I want to remind the Assembly \r\nthat the process truly reflects all interests and positions \r\nrepresented in the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nWe are convinced that Africa’s voice should be fully \r\nrepresented on the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to a successful \r\nseventy-third session, and we hope that the President’s \r\nelection will strengthen efforts aimed at highlighting \r\nthe plight of rural women and girls.\r\nBefore I conclude, let me express our sincere \r\ncondolences to the family of the late former Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan. Mr. Annan was a formidable voice \r\non everything, including reform of the United Nations. \r\nHe stood for a just world and was a passionate advocate \r\nof good governance and fundamental freedoms. Kofi \r\nAnnan will surely be greatly missed.\r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n30/49 18-29775\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof the Gambia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Adama Barrow, President of the Republic \r\nof the Gambia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Ms. Hilda Heine, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of the \r\nMarshall Islands.\r\nMs. Hilda Heine, President of the Republic of the \r\nMarshall Islands, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Ms. Hilda Heine, President of \r\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands, and to invite her \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Heine: I have the honour to bring the \r\nAssembly warm greetings of yokwe on behalf of the \r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands.\r\nIn its best moments, the United Nations has \r\nserved as a common platform for every nation, but \r\nespecially the most vulnerable. Today nations are \r\npulling in new directions, stretching the threads that \r\nhold us all together and pushing the world to the edge. \r\nIt is imperative that the States Members of the United \r\nNations continue to unite behind an international rules-\r\nbased order that does not overlook the voices of the \r\nmost vulnerable peoples. As a former United Nations \r\nstrategic trusteeship, the Marshall Islands can speak \r\nwith authority from its own history of the times when \r\nthe sheer will of the most powerful ravaged our shores \r\nand when the common concerns of humankind failed \r\nus, as well as those times when it ensured that our \r\nMarshallese voices mattered. We welcome engagement \r\nwith the world’s largest Powers but they must have our \r\nbest interests at heart.\r\nHuman rights stand as a challenging universal \r\nideal that all must aspire to and uphold. The Human \r\nRights Council has tremendous potential to provide \r\ntransparency and dialogue and foster progress. While \r\nwe must take more time to carefully connect global \r\nnorms and national implementation, because one size \r\nnever fits all, the United Nations must never hesitate \r\nto stand up to actors who seek to evade what everyone \r\nelse might see as common decency. And that is not \r\nan abstract statement. From our own history and \r\ncontemporary challenges, the Marshall Islands knows \r\nthe dire consequences that arise when the international \r\ncommunity looks the other way because of political \r\nexpediency. Far more political will is needed to \r\ntruly ensure that no one is left behind. Whatever the \r\nshortcomings of the Human Rights Council, it is the \r\nresponsibility of Member States to address. We must \r\nfix it ourselves. We will not stand by in silence.\r\nFor those reasons, the Republic of the Marshall \r\nIslands has put forward its candidacy for the Human \r\nRights Council for the term from 2020 to 2022. Real \r\ncommitment is in actions, not in words. As an example, \r\nwe have not only enacted disability rights legislation \r\nto meet our treaty obligations, we currently have a bill \r\nbefore Parliament that amends more than 100 existing \r\nstatutes to ensure that we mainstream rights across all \r\nsectors. We are moving towards a similar undertaking \r\non the issue of gender. Our partners, including the \r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the \r\nPacific, have already been key sources of assistance, \r\nbut it is our political will that can make it a reality. \r\nHuman rights are not just treaty signatures; they are a \r\nvisible step-change in our local communities.\r\nSmall nations can have a unique role within the \r\nmultilateral system. We would not have the United \r\nNations Law of the Sea, the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change or a great many other \r\noutcomes but for the political will of small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDs). We represent a quarter of \r\nthis body’s membership, but does the United Nations \r\nsystem invest equally in us? We will struggle to tackle \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals unless there is \r\nurgent attention to putting our own data capacity to \r\nuse from the international system. Many of our core \r\nsocial development indicators sit stagnant. While we \r\nare trying to change all of this, we cannot do so without \r\nan international system that is directly focused on our \r\nunique character.\r\nI strongly support the Secretary-General’s initiative \r\nfor United Nations system reform — to do more and do \r\nit better, with the resources at hand. Our present United \r\nNations Resident Coordinator is not a resident at all and \r\nfaces the impossible task of effectively serving 10 remote \r\nnations at once. I look forward to the upcoming review \r\nof the United Nations multi-country offices, mandated \r\nin resolution 72/279, and urge innovative solutions. \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 31/49\r\nThis year is a key opportunity for the United Nations \r\nsystem to make the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of \r\nAction Pathway for small island developing States a \r\nreal opportunity for system change.\r\nDecades ago, small island developing States \r\nwarned the world of the risks of climate change, and \r\nthose are still radical threats. Now we must spend \r\ntime on advocacy. It is time that we literally do not \r\nhave. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change stands \r\nstrong as a powerful and united legal commitment \r\non the part of all — the largest and smallest among \r\nus — to sparing no effort in doing more to ensure a \r\nrise in average temperatures of no more than 1.5º C. I \r\nstrongly support the Secretary-General’s forthcoming \r\n2019 climate summit. It is an opportunity at the highest \r\nlevels for leaders to reshape headlines and put the Paris \r\nAgreement into motion by responding to the urgent \r\nneeds for enhanced action and ambition at true scale. It \r\nis not just a moral promise, but an economic reality, as \r\nenergy markets already point to better choices.\r\nI am not asking others to do things that we will not \r\ndo at home. This week, I announced that the Marshall \r\nIslands is transitioning to a net-zero emissions target by \r\n2050. We are already taking action, not only to meet that \r\ngoal but also to increase our near-term ambitions and \r\naccelerate adaptation efforts. In raising our ambitions, \r\nI know we will not be alone. The Pacific Islands Forum \r\nleaders, in last month’s Boe Declaration, declared \r\nclimate change to be the single greatest security threat \r\nto our region. That political will must extend to urgent \r\nand prioritized assistance to help atoll nations such \r\nas the Marshall Islands, whose very survival is at \r\nrisk, to adapt to the climate-driven threats we already \r\nface and prevent a future tipping point only a decade \r\nor two away. Much more political effort is needed on \r\nscaling and targeting climate finance so that good \r\nintentions from partners can make a visible impact in \r\nlocal communities.\r\nAs a low-lying atoll island nation little more than \r\none metre above sea level, the Marshall Islands have a \r\nfuture that hangs in the balance, but that is not the case \r\nfor us alone. Although as an atoll nation we are the most \r\nvulnerable, we are joined not only by other small island \r\ndeveloping States but by many other countries that face \r\nserious challenges posed by climate impacts. As Chair \r\nof the Climate Vulnerable Forum, I call on every leader \r\nin the world to join me on 22 November in an online \r\nvirtual summit to ensure that no one and no country is \r\nleft behind.\r\nThe Marshall Islands emerged from the colonial \r\nperiod, the Second World War and the effects of nuclear \r\ntesting conducted more than six decades ago. As we \r\nwere adopting our Constitution in 1979 and becoming \r\na State Member of the United Nations in 1991, we were \r\nfocused entirely on building a nation to leave behind \r\nfor our children. Only 27 years later, now facing \r\nthe consequences of climate change, we are asking \r\nourselves what legacy we as a nation will leave for our \r\ngrandchildren to inherit.\r\nLast year’s United Nations Ocean Conference set the \r\nstage to ensure that the oceans, which cover two thirds \r\nof the world’s surface, must no longer be an isolated \r\nsilo but must become an integral part of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and global commitment. The Marshall \r\nIslands is more than 99 per cent ocean. It is our culture, \r\nour primary economic pathway and our identity. The \r\nworld must move far beyond words and towards actions \r\nbecause we should all be gravely alarmed at what has \r\ntoo often become a downward spiral.\r\nEarlier this year, the eight Pacific leaders of the \r\nparties to the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation \r\nin the Management of Fisheries of Common Interest met \r\nin the Marshall Islands, the first such leaders’ meeting \r\nsince 2010. In the intervening years, we have rewritten \r\nthe playbook for global tuna markets, working to ensure \r\nthat ours will not only be an economic lifeline for our \r\nfuture generations but will also remain a valuable \r\nsource of global food security and the world’s largest \r\nsustainable purse-seine tuna fishery.\r\nIn that regard, I welcome the outreach and \r\nengagement of the Group of Seven leaders, under the \r\nleadership of Canada, to focus on oceans and fisheries. \r\nInternational development finance sources must \r\nimprove targeted delivery and direct support. Marine \r\nplastic pollution is crippling global waters, and illegal \r\nfishing in the Pacific is more than a violation of law \r\nand treaty, it is a major regional security issue. Next \r\nweek, the Marshall Islands will host the launching \r\nof a regional initiative for a Pacific region free of \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in order \r\nto eradicate illegal fishing from our region once and \r\nfor all. Enhanced efforts on illegal fishing are needed \r\nfrom regional fisheries management organizations, \r\nand we should not be afraid to name and shame the \r\nworst offenders.\r\nAs the first woman Head of State or Government \r\nin the independent Pacific islands region, I say that \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n32/49 18-29775\r\nit is vital that the United Nations accelerate efforts to \r\nensure that all women, and especially our youngest \r\ngenerations, must see that they have a rightful role at all \r\nlevels of decision-making, including the highest levels \r\nof political leadership and economic development. \r\nAfter all, we women represent the half of the world’s \r\npopulation that is not yet fully reflected among the \r\nranks of global leaders.\r\nFor too many years, multilateral discussions to \r\nend nuclear weapons have gone in circles. I strongly \r\nwelcome progress whenever it is found and remain \r\ncautiously optimistic of efforts towards a safe and \r\nsecure Korean peninsula, with complete, verifiable \r\nand irreversible denuclearization. However, until that \r\nis achieved, the Marshall Islands strongly affirms its \r\ncommitment to the full implementation of the Security \r\nCouncil’s sanctions, including in the maritime sector.\r\nThreats of atmospheric testing in the Pacific Ocean \r\nare of obvious concern to me and my fellow Pacific \r\nisland leaders, and for every Marshallese citizen, \r\nthe effects of nuclear testing are not only a historical \r\nlegacy, but a contemporary reality. Those were the \r\nonly instances where the United Nations ever explicitly \r\nauthorized the testing of nuclear weapons, and the \r\nconsequences have been horrific. The 67 nuclear \r\nweapons tests conducted between 1946 and 1958 have \r\naffected multiple generations.\r\nThose tests took place at a time when we held \r\nstatus as a United Nations strategic trust territory, \r\nincluding testing that was authorized by United \r\nNations Trusteeship Council resolutions 1082 (XIV) \r\nand 1493 (XVII). That is a burden that no other nation \r\nor people should ever bear. That is not only a lesson \r\nthat the world must learn from, but a situation where \r\nthe United Nations has already offered its assistance. \r\nMy Government recently established a national nuclear \r\ncommission to work carefully with affected local \r\ncommunities and regional and international agencies \r\nto better elaborate our complex issues and develop a \r\nstrategy for nuclear justice. It is vital that we make \r\nevery possible effort, with all possible speed, to help \r\nus address human rights issues and the environment of \r\nour affected people.\r\nThe Security Council and the United Nations as a \r\nwhole must adapt and change. This is not the world of \r\nseven decades ago. It is important to realize Security \r\nCouncil reform and launch text-based negotiations \r\nfor Security Council reform during this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nDecolonization and human rights are both \r\nimportant issues in the Pacific islands region. I \r\nstrongly affirm the position of the Pacific Island Forum \r\nleaders in recognizing the constructive engagement \r\nof Forum countries with Indonesia with respect to \r\nelections and human rights issues in West Papua, and \r\nthe commitment to continuing dialogue in an open and \r\nconstructive manner.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands supports the \r\nrecognition of Taiwan’s meaningful participation within \r\nthe United Nations system, including programmes \r\nand agencies such as the International Civil Aviation \r\nOrganization, the World Health Organization and the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. The people of Taiwan deserve equal treatment, \r\nand the United Nations should resolve the serious issue \r\nof the exclusion of Taiwan’s 23 million people from the \r\nUnited Nations system, an issue that we believe is not \r\naddressed in resolution 2758 (XXVI).\r\nTaiwan has been implementing the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and has released a voluntary \r\nnational review. It has the capacity to contribute to \r\na wide range of United Nations programmes that are \r\nrelevant to global progress. Diseases such as tuberculosis \r\nknow no boundaries, and Taiwan has brought its \r\npolicy framework in line with global efforts. Taiwan \r\nhas served as a primary partner of my own nation in \r\naddressing non-communicable diseases, which are now \r\nat crisis levels. Blocking Taiwan’s participation does \r\nnot benefit global human welfare.\r\nIn conclusion, it is imperative that, as truly united \r\nnations, we take to heart the national motto of the \r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands, Jepilpin ke Ejukaan, \r\nwhich translates as “accomplishment through joint \r\neffort”. What we do as leaders at the United Nations \r\nand beyond is a legacy for the next generation and those \r\nthat follow.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof the Marshall Islands for the statement she has \r\njust made.\r\nMs. Hilda Heine, President of the Republic of the \r\nMarshall Islands, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 33/49\r\nAddress by Mr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President \r\nof the Dominican Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Dominican Republic.\r\nMr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, \r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Medina Sánchez (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to congratulate Ambassador \r\nMaría Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and to wish her every \r\npossible success. It is a great honour for me to be able \r\nto once again address the Assembly as President of the \r\nDominican Republic. This is a special occasion for our \r\ncountry, because next year the Dominican Republic will \r\nsit on the Security Council as a non-permanent member \r\nfor the first time.\r\nOn behalf of the Dominican people and myself, \r\nI would therefore like to start by thanking the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations for the support we have \r\nreceived in joining the Security Council. In particular, I \r\nthank the members of the Group of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States for the trust placed in us. Our purpose \r\nduring our term will be to contribute a voice for Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean to one of the forums for \r\ngreater global responsibility in the maintenance \r\nof peace.\r\nOf course, we are committed to asserting, both in \r\nthe Security Council and in the Assembly, the same \r\nunbreakable principles that guide us as a nation. Respect \r\nfor human rights, democracy, freedom and diversity \r\nwill therefore be the beacon that we will follow in order \r\nto guide our work in the Security Council. We will do \r\neverything possible to honour the trust placed in us, \r\nbeing fully aware that, although fragile, stability and \r\nsecurity are priority objectives that must be preserved \r\nand progress made towards, step by step and day by day.\r\nIt is clear to us that in a space that addresses issues \r\nthat can change the course of history and the fate of \r\nmillions of people, we cannot seek easy and drastic \r\nsolutions, which in any case do not exist. In that \r\ncontext, our country will always be a place of dialogue \r\nand understanding, and will always seek peaceful \r\nsolutions. We are always willing to do whatever it takes \r\nto find common ground and support consensus as the \r\nbest tool for peace and development. We will therefore \r\nalways promote rapprochement among peoples through \r\nmediation and democratic dialogue, opening spaces for \r\na future of shared peace.\r\nSince its founding more than seven decades ago, \r\nthe United Nations has played a central role in creating \r\na more stable and secure world for human beings \r\nacross the globe. However, we can never consider \r\nstability a definitive achievement. We cannot lower our \r\nguard when we know, for example, that in our Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean region alone, 35 per cent of \r\nthe population belongs to the so-called vulnerable class \r\nand could therefore fall back into poverty when faced \r\nwith any setback.\r\nBy the same token, it is fair to recognize that like \r\nso many other things, security is not well distributed. \r\nWe all know that there are territories in the Americas \r\nand in many other places around the world where the \r\nprospect of living peacefully and without fear is an \r\nalmost utopian vision, due to the control that organized \r\ncrime exercises in those territories.\r\nWhat can we do, then, to make this a more stable \r\nworld? What measures can we implement to ensure that \r\nsecurity is not solely the asset of a select few countries, \r\nbut one that extends throughout the world and reaches \r\nevery neighbourhood and village? Of course, I am \r\nnot the only one asking those questions — everyone \r\nhere has asked them at some point — nor will I give \r\ndefinitive answers, which can be formulated and found \r\nonly by working together. What I will do is briefly \r\nmention what I consider two of the main threats to \r\nglobal stability and security. I am referring to climate \r\nchange and drug trafficking and organized crime.\r\nAt first glance, they may seem very different from \r\neach other, but their complexity and global scope makes \r\nthem two of the main challenges facing humankind. \r\nIn both cases, the consequences are the destruction of \r\nthousands of families, collateral damage to all aspects \r\nof human development and the overwhelming of States \r\nby the magnitude of the challenges they face.\r\nLet us start by talking about the consequences of \r\nnatural disasters, which are occurring more and more \r\nfrequently. We only have to open the newspaper or turn \r\non the television to see the effects of climate change \r\nwreaking havoc somewhere on the planet. From the \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n34/49 18-29775\r\ntyphoon that recently hit the Philippines, the strongest \r\nin decades, to the hurricane seasons that punish the \r\nCaribbean islands with increasing ferocity, no corner of \r\nthe world is safe. Last year we saw Hurricane Irma leave \r\nHavana totally f looded, and it took many weeks for \r\nthings to return to normal. Meanwhile, in Puerto Rico, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda and other Caribbean islands, it has \r\ntaken months to recover from the effects of Hurricane \r\nMaria, which not only brought about economic losses \r\nbut also claimed a considerable number of human lives.\r\nIn the Dominican Republic, we are strongly \r\ncommitted to dealing with the consequences of \r\nclimate change. That means that we are working \r\nsimultaneously on three levels of action, local, national \r\nand international. It is at the local level where people’s \r\ndaily lives develop. It is there that tragedies take \r\non a painful reality and where the work of building, \r\npreparing and raising awareness must begin.\r\nIt is at the local and national levels where our \r\nGovernment has a greater capacity to act and where we \r\nare improving resilience and relocating the communities \r\nthat live around our most significant watersheds, which \r\nare highly vulnerable to meteorological events. We \r\nare also doing a great deal of public awareness work \r\nand training thousands of teachers and technicians \r\nto promote sustainable development in their schools \r\nand communities.\r\nThen there is the national level, where we are \r\nalso working tirelessly, both on our rapid-response \r\nstrategies and in the field of prevention. For instance, \r\nwe are planting millions of trees across our country \r\nand investing more than ever before in renewable \r\nenergy. Those measures will not only support our \r\neconomy, they will enable us to reduce our emissions \r\nof greenhouse gases by 25 per cent by 2030, a goal that \r\nwe are very pleased about.\r\nHowever, the fight against climate change is a \r\ntask for all of us, and that is why the next level — the \r\ninternational level — is the broadest and most essential \r\nof the three. If there is no political will in this area, \r\nmost of our efforts will come to nothing and will have \r\na negative impact on all the progress we have made \r\nat the local and national levels. That is why I would \r\nlike to reiterate once again before the Assembly the \r\nimportance of going beyond good intentions and \r\nfocusing on concrete actions.\r\nAmong those actions, I want to once again highlight \r\nthe urgency of financing and making operational \r\ninitiatives such as the Warsaw International Mechanism \r\nfor Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change \r\nImpacts, which will make it possible to compensate for \r\nthe destruction of infrastructure and ecosystems and \r\nalleviate the threatening conditions of our residents. \r\nThat fund is essential to ensuring that natural disasters \r\ndo not destroy in a few hours what many nations have \r\nspent decades building.\r\nI will give one example, on the understanding \r\nthat our case is not the most tragic in the Caribbean \r\nregion. Last year, the storms Olga and Maria spelled \r\nthe destruction of more than $1 billion worth of \r\ninfrastructure. Imagine what that means for a country \r\nwhose annual State budget is already limited. Above \r\nall, the Warsaw fund will help protect the valuable \r\nlives of millions of human beings, bringing them peace \r\nof mind for their homes and granting them a future \r\nwithout a constant uncertain feeling of threat every time \r\nthey see that rain is coming. We therefore consider it \r\nindisputable that those countries that have most heavily \r\ncontributed to the gas emissions that are responsible \r\nfor climate change are also those that should contribute \r\nproportionally to the fund established to mitigate \r\nits effects.\r\nAs I described earlier, we also consider drug \r\ntrafficking and organized crime to be a threat to global \r\nsecurity and stability of a similar magnitude to that of \r\nclimate change. The trafficking of illicit substances \r\nclaims thousands of lives every year, particularly \r\nof young people, who are extremely valuable to \r\nour countries. As if that were not bad enough, drug \r\ntrafficking also permeates our institutions, unbalances \r\nour economies, threatens our values and brings nothing \r\nbut degradation and destruction to our social fabric. \r\nWherever organized crime prevails, the security and \r\npeace of our peoples always deteriorate over time. As \r\nwith climate change, therefore, the fight against drugs \r\nmust be conducted at all three levels — local, national \r\nand international — in order to achieve effective results.\r\nIn the case of our country, local intervention is \r\nfocused on prevention campaigns and educating our \r\nyoung people by supporting them with training and \r\nentrepreneurial opportunities, while also improving \r\nthe neighbourhoods where they live and recovering \r\npublic spaces for people to use. We do all of that with \r\nthe aim of saving the most vulnerable populations from \r\ncriminal networks.\r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 35/49\r\nAt the national level, our security forces and \r\nnational drug control directorate are working all \r\nover the country as part of a comprehensive plan to \r\nstrengthen our actions against drug trafficking. Among \r\nother initiatives, we are acquiring new, high-tech \r\nequipment and strengthening security at our ports and \r\nairports with more agents and security checks, as well \r\nas carrying out in-depth interventions in areas with the \r\nhighest incidence of crime. In parallel, we have moved \r\nforward with the enactment of a law against money-\r\nlaundering and the financing of terrorism, based on the \r\nrecommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, \r\nwith an emphasis on preventing and combating money-\r\nlaundering, which drug traffickers use to ensure the \r\nprofitability of their activities.\r\nFinally, at the international level, we have bilateral \r\nand multilateral agreements in place with the United \r\nStates, the European Union and the countries of the \r\nCentral American Integration System, as well as \r\nparticipating in the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, \r\nall with the objective of coordinating efforts and \r\nimproving our efficiency in combating drug trafficking \r\nand organized crime. Thanks to such initiatives, we \r\nare better prepared to fight together against that evil, \r\nwhich threatens the integrity of our economies and our \r\ndemocracies. However, we must emphasize the need for \r\ngreater international coordination.\r\nWe can make great strides forward if we join our \r\nefforts, share information and support each other in \r\nour work. We also understand that showing greater \r\ncommitment is the responsibility of countries that due \r\nto their domestic demand for narcotics, have set in \r\nmotion the international machinery of drug trafficking \r\nand organized crime. We cannot ignore the fact that \r\nit is the developing States that act as the first barrier \r\nin  containing drug trafficking, thereby protecting the \r\nmost developed countries.\r\nOur countries allocate billions of dollars each year \r\nto fulfilling that role, but it is never enough in the face \r\nof the huge resources deployed by organized crime \r\nnetworks. That is undoubtedly a key factor in the social \r\ndisintegration that many of our countries are dealing \r\nwith. As in the case of climate change, it is the more \r\ndeveloped countries with greater consumption capacity \r\nthat must dedicate more resources, cooperation and \r\npolitical will if they truly wish to fight the problem \r\nwith any hope of victory.\r\nIn combating the effects of drug trafficking and \r\nclimate change, we will address some of the structural \r\ncauses of deeper poverty and social inequality. If the \r\nUnited Nations and the developed countries want to \r\nhelp fight poverty more comprehensively and openly, \r\nthose two fronts are an intelligent, humane and cost-\r\neffective way to do so. We once again appeal to those \r\ncountries from this rostrum to show the responsibility \r\nand solidarity we need to make our planet a safer place.\r\nClimate change, drug trafficking, poverty, social \r\ninequality and mass migration are all interrelated \r\nproblems that we must deal with urgently. As we have \r\npointed out today, the best and perhaps only way to do \r\nthat is to act at all levels of response to the problem, so \r\nthat the agreements we sign in a forum like the United \r\nNations have a real impact on the lives of the people, \r\nand so that the needs of our peoples are articulated in \r\ntheir national and international institutions.\r\nWe must therefore all continue to act according to \r\nour capacities, without hesitation and with the same \r\nobjective of creating a world that is increasingly stable, \r\nsecure and developed, a world in which all men and \r\nwomen can carry forward their life dreams. That is the \r\nultimate goal that the Dominican Republic will continue \r\nto work for. We will do it in our towns, neighbourhoods \r\nand all of our cities; with our immediate neighbours \r\nand with all members of the General Assembly; and in \r\nthe Security Council next year, in the new role that we \r\nwill be honoured to assume.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDominican Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bakir Izetbegović, Chairman of the \r\nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Chairman of the Presidency of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nMr. Bakir Izetbegović, Chairman of the Presidency \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Excellency Mr. Bakir Izetbegović, \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n36/49 18-29775\r\nChairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Izetbegović: It is my honour to address \r\nthe Assembly for the fourth and final time as the \r\nChairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\nI congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his leadership \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. \r\nHe worked tirelessly together with Secretary-General \r\nGuterres to make the Organization more effective. I am \r\nglad that the agenda for this year’s session will maintain \r\na focus on those efforts.\r\nI congratulate Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés \r\non her election. The fact that she is only the fourth \r\nwoman to hold the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nsince 1946 is a reminder that gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women must remain our top priority.\r\nTwo years ago, from this rostrum (see A/71/PV.12), \r\nI ref lected on a number of ways and means to make our \r\nworld more just and prosperous for all. Standing here \r\ntoday, I do not see much to rejoice about in terms of \r\nthe progress we have made. Challenges have continued \r\nto multiply uncontrollably. Old conflicts have been \r\nmagnified and new ones created. When compared to the \r\npast three decades, more countries are now engulfed in \r\ncrises that are more violent and disruptive and result in \r\never greater divides. Those modern crises and conflicts \r\nare rarely confined to their place of origin. They shake \r\nentire regions and often proliferate further into the \r\ntransnational arena.\r\nRecord numbers of civilians are victims of \r\nindiscriminate yet deliberate armed attacks. Many \r\nmore are subjected to persecution, discrimination, \r\nmarginalization and violations of basic human rights. \r\nMany others fall victim to natural disasters. The \r\nnumber of refugees, displaced persons and those in dire \r\nneed of humanitarian assistance continues to rise.\r\nIt is through that lens that I want to reflect on \r\nthree issues that are critical to addressing the global \r\nproblems that we face — multilateralism, international \r\nlaw and the rules-based international order. I believe \r\nthat adherence to multilateralism, compliance with \r\ninternational law and shared commitment to the rules-\r\nbased global order is our only hope and the only way to \r\nresolve the complex challenges that confront us.\r\nWhether it be conflict prevention or resolution, \r\nsecurity, development, climate change, nuclear \r\nproliferation, terrorism, migration or human rights, \r\nnone of these problems can be successfully addressed \r\nor resolved by one, three or five countries alone. \r\nEach and every one of those issues has transnational \r\ndimensions. Effective responses require an exercise \r\nin responsibility and respect for agreed international \r\nnorms and standards, strong coalitions based on mutual \r\ntrust, and progressive, inclusive and democratic vision \r\nand leadership that embrace a new understanding of \r\nnational sovereignty.\r\nYet today we are witnessing severe attacks on \r\nthe rules-based international order and the purposes, \r\nprinciples and norms of international law, which \r\nthreaten to seriously undermine international peace \r\nand security. There are plenty of examples in our recent \r\npast that show what disregard for international law and \r\nthe rules-based international order can bring. Those \r\ndark chapters of our history were a direct result of the \r\ncommunity of nations failing to uphold the rules and \r\nnorms on which our world order has been based when \r\nthose very same rules and norms were challenged.\r\nOur citizens want to live in a peaceful world in \r\nwhich human dignity is respected and fundamental \r\nhuman rights and freedoms are protected. That is \r\nthe raison d’être of the Organization. That obligation \r\ngoes far beyond our national borders or interests. No \r\nGovernment can focus only on delivering stability and \r\nprosperity to its own people while ignoring what goes on \r\nbeyond its national borders, in its neighbourhood and in \r\nthe wider world. To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt, the \r\nstructure for meeting any of the numerous challenges \r\nwe face, including building and sustaining world peace, \r\ncannot be the work of one man or one nation large or \r\nsmall, but must be the cooperative effort of the whole \r\nworld. Those words resonate today in the same way \r\nthey did over seven decades ago.\r\nCooperative approaches have been key to \r\neliminating smallpox, vaccinating record numbers \r\nof infants against preventable diseases and beating \r\nback the menace of AIDS. Concerted efforts and the \r\nalliance of all nations are necessary to contain the \r\nrisks of nuclear confrontation and successfully address \r\nglobal issues such as gender equality, climate change \r\nor the prosecution of war criminals at the international \r\nlevel. The spirit of multilateralism is essential in \r\norder to achieve and maintain peace, security and \r\ndevelopment around the world. A man who championed \r\nmultilateralism in his lifelong work on the world stage, \r\nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan, once said:\r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 37/49\r\n“More than ever before in human history, we \r\nshare a common destiny. We can master it only if \r\nwe face it together. And that ... is why we have the \r\nUnited Nations.”\r\nWe must reaffirm this Organization of unified \r\nnations as the true embodiment of multilateralism. \r\nIt is the only forum that brings together almost 200 \r\ncountries to seek joint solutions to global problems that \r\naffect us all. It is the only forum that has the capacity, \r\ndedication and compassion to solve those problems. \r\nIt is the only forum where the voices of both big and \r\nsmall countries can be heard equally, even if all of \r\nthose voices are not always equally acknowledged. \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is strongly committed to the \r\npreservation and strengthening of the United Nations, \r\nits values and principles, its missions and mandates, \r\nand its relevance, credibility and cohesion.\r\nTime and again, we must remind ourselves of the \r\nfundamental values and principles that are enshrined \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations and that embody \r\nthe essence of the rules-based international order. \r\nThose principles and values remain as relevant today \r\nas they were in 1945. The primary responsibility of the \r\nOrganization and all its States Members is to uphold \r\nand protect those commitments in the face of the \r\nmodern challenges that profoundly test them.\r\nThe strong leadership and engagement of the United \r\nNations, in particular its Security Council, in line with \r\nthe norms of international law, are indispensable in \r\nsituations such as those in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq and \r\nLibya, and in other crisis areas. Yet our responses \r\nto modern crises and conflicts have unfortunately \r\nbeen marked by a disregard for international law, \r\ndepartures from multilateralism and a failure to adhere \r\nto the rules-based international order, by inaction and \r\nindifference to human suffering and violations of basic \r\nhuman rights.\r\nLet us look at the Middle East, for example. The \r\nconflict in Syria has entered its eighth year, and we are \r\nnowhere close to bringing it to a resolution. Some of the \r\nmost sustained violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw in modern times, including the indiscriminate use \r\nof chemical weapons, have gone unabated. Civilian \r\ncasualties are constantly on the rise. The humanitarian \r\nsituation keeps deteriorating.\r\nThe same applies to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, \r\nwhich has lasted for more than half a century and \r\nbrought about immense human suffering. Holding \r\na region hostage, as individual national interests \r\ncompromise the interests of civilians who are caught in \r\nendless cycles of violence, is unacceptable.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina will continue to support \r\nmultilateral efforts to find solutions that will bring \r\nsustained peace and stability to the Syrian people and \r\nmeet the legitimate expectations of both the Israelis and \r\nPalestinians of having two democratic States, living \r\nside by side within secure and recognized borders, in \r\nline with international law. As much as finding such \r\nsolutions is a political question, it is also a matter of our \r\ncommon humanity.\r\nOur shared ambition to leave no one behind is also \r\nput at serious risk by the evolving threat of radicalization, \r\nviolent extremism and terrorism. That modern scourge \r\neasily finds fuel to sustain it not only in armed conflicts \r\nbut also in social and political injustices, discrimination, \r\nmarginalization and exclusion, poverty, unemployment \r\nand economic disadvantage.\r\nViolent extremism and terrorism transcend physical \r\nand virtual borders. They constantly change tactics and \r\ninvent new ways and means to spread. Extremists and \r\nterrorists remain intent on driving a wedge between \r\nand within societies, hindering our efforts to maintain \r\npeace and security, protect human rights and foster \r\nsustainable development. Our response must therefore \r\nbe decisive, coherent, comprehensive and grounded in \r\nthe international counter-terrorism framework that we \r\nhave created. Bosnia and Herzegovina remains strongly \r\ncommitted to contributing to global efforts to counter \r\nand eradicate that modern menace in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations. This is a profound challenge of our time \r\nthat needs to be confronted at every step and by every \r\nmeans at our disposal.\r\nThe United Nations peacebuilding architecture \r\nremains as important as ever in addressing all the \r\nchallenges that persist on the path towards sustainable \r\npeace around the world. We recognize the value of \r\nintroducing the United Nations peacebuilding efforts \r\nat an early stage, alongside peacekeeping activities. \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina supports the vision and efforts \r\nof Secretary-General Guterres to mainstream conflict \r\nprevention and peacebuilding as priorities of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is proud of its contribution \r\nto those goals through our participation in the United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions in South Sudan, \r\nCyprus, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n38/49 18-29775\r\nCongo and Mali. We have joined more than 130 other \r\ncountries and organizations in endorsing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Declaration of Shared Commitments on \r\nUnited Nations Peacekeeping Operations. We support \r\nhis efforts to make the United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions stronger and more effective.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is \r\nthe most powerful connector among the various pillars \r\nof the United Nations work. Its implementation is the \r\nmost important pathway to global peace, security and \r\nprosperity. It will help States and societies establish \r\nresilient institutions that are able to detect, manage and \r\nabsorb tensions; address and eliminate the root causes \r\nof conflicts and prevent their recurrence and create \r\nconditions for inclusive and sustainable development \r\nby reducing poverty, inequality and discrimination, \r\nensuring respect for human rights and combating \r\nenvironmental degradation. The 2030 Agenda is a \r\ncatalyst for sustainable and inclusive development \r\nrooted in respect for economic, social, cultural, civil \r\nand political rights. We believe that it is the best way to \r\nprevent conflicts and instability.\r\nStrong global and regional cooperation, whether \r\non matters of conflict prevention and resolution, the \r\nfight against terrorism or the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda, is essential to the success of all those \r\nefforts. Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly values the \r\ncooperation we have established within our region \r\nof the Western Balkans. We remain committed to \r\nadvancing that cooperation, including on our joint path \r\ntowards membership in the European Union.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina strives for the protection \r\nand promotion of values and principles that are shared \r\nby all countries. We believe that the ideals, values and \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the norms and standards inscribed in international \r\nlaw should never be violated or disregarded. We believe \r\nthat it is the obligation of all countries — big and small, \r\npowerful or less powerful — to uphold the noble values \r\nand principles on which the Organization is built. If \r\nany of us lacks the will to uphold those values and \r\nprinciples, then all our endeavours will be less valuable \r\nand less successful.\r\nOn that note, I leave the Assembly with the words of \r\na great man, Nelson Mandela, as we mark the centenary \r\nof his birth,\r\n“What counts in life is not the mere fact that we \r\nhave lived. It is what difference we have made to the \r\nlives of others that will determine the significance \r\nof the life we lead.”\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Chairman of the \r\nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Bakir Izetbegović, Chairman of the Presidency \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of \r\nthe Republic of Mozambique\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic \r\nof Mozambique.\r\nMr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic \r\nof Mozambique, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Nyusi (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I have the \r\ngreat honour to address the General Assembly in the \r\ngeneral debate of its seventy-third session.\r\nWe warmly salute Her Excellency Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés and congratulate her on \r\nher election to preside over this session of the General \r\nAssembly, which is meeting under the theme “Making \r\nthe United Nations relevant to all people: global \r\nleadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, \r\nequitable and sustainable societies”. We assure her \r\nof the full support of Mozambique as she discharges \r\nher mandate.\r\nWe congratulate the outgoing President, \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák, on his outstanding success \r\nand commitment to mobilizing the international \r\ncommunity towards implementing the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nWe express our appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. António Guterres, for his dedicated \r\nwork and leadership of the Organization on behalf \r\nof the causes of international peace and security and \r\nsustainable development.\r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 39/49\r\nI would also like to express our deep condolences on \r\nthe passing of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. \r\nMr. Annan honoured Africa and the whole world with \r\nhis devotion to just global causes. The Assembly is also \r\ntaking place at a time when we are celebrating what \r\nwould have been the 100th birthday of Nelson Mandela, \r\nthat icon in the fight for freedom, peace, equality and \r\nfraternity. Those two great men should inspire us in our \r\ncollective fight for a better world of peace, prosperity, \r\nsecurity and welfare for our peoples.\r\nMozambique acknowledges the role of the United \r\nNations in promoting dialogue and defending the \r\nprinciple of the peaceful resolution of the conflicts \r\nthat continue to affect peoples and nations, violating \r\nhuman rights and hindering sustainable and inclusive \r\ndevelopment. The United Nations is the mother forum \r\nof multilateral dialogue, uniting States’ commitments \r\nto implementing global agendas and other instruments \r\naimed at enabling us to achieve shared objectives. An \r\nunequal and fractured world requires multilateralism to \r\naddress its gaps. The progress that has been made so far \r\ndemonstrates unequivocally that the global imperative \r\nof sharing responsibilities is an essential element \r\nin building a peaceful, just and harmonious world. \r\nExamples of that include the implementation of the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change and recent efforts \r\nto eliminate nuclear arms and to regulate and humanize \r\nmigration with a view to averting humanitarian \r\ncatastrophes. From that list, I should also point to \r\nmatters relating to human rights and good governance, \r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts and financing for \r\ndevelopment, among others.\r\nIn that regard, Mozambique supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his efforts to reform the United Nations \r\nsystem with a view to ensuring that it is fit for purpose. \r\nMozambique also commends his inclusive approach \r\nin engaging the States Members of the United Nations \r\nat every stage of the process. In addition to those \r\nongoing reforms, accelerating reform of the Security \r\nCouncil is another urgent and important element that \r\nwill go a long way to reaffirming the relevance of the \r\nrole of the United Nations in its quest for sustainable \r\nsolutions to the challenges to peace and security \r\nthat humankind is facing. The difficulty of reaching \r\nconsensus among Member States on negotiating these \r\nissues also limits the Security Council’s capacity to act \r\nas one of the Organization’s pillars, without which it \r\nwill be impossible to successfully implement the 2030 \r\nAgenda. Those reforms will effectively ensure that the \r\nUnited Nations is relevant to all peoples, which is what \r\nwe all desire.\r\nWith regard to peace and security, Mozambique \r\ncontinues to follow with deep concern the many \r\ncontinuing f lashpoints of political instability represented \r\nby inter- and intra-State conflicts, particularly in \r\nAfrica and the Middle East. We have closely followed \r\nthe tensions on the Korean peninsula, as well as the \r\ngrowing problems everywhere of fundamentalism and \r\nviolent extremism. We hope that the peace initiatives \r\nunder way at the global level, as well as measures to \r\nsuppress the recruitment and curb the financing of \r\nterrorist groups, will enable us to continue to promote \r\nfurther peaceful development for their peoples.\r\nThe right to self-determination of the peoples of \r\nWestern Sahara and Palestine remains a concern for \r\nthe international community. The lack of progress on \r\nthe issue of a referendum on self-determination for \r\nthe people of Western Sahara is a continuing source \r\nof concern for all peace-loving peoples. With regard \r\nto the Palestinian problem, we believe in a two-State \r\nsolution, based on two peoples living side by side \r\nand on the principles of international law related to \r\ngood-neighbourliness, peaceful coexistence, dialogue \r\nand tolerance. And Mozambique once again joins the \r\nmajority of States present in this Hall in appealing for \r\nthe normalization of political, diplomatic, economic \r\nand financial relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates of America.\r\nMozambique has also dedicated much effort to \r\nremoving obstacles to peace, promoting inclusiveness \r\nand creating an environment conducive to equitable \r\nand sustainable development. Our commitment to \r\na constructive national dialogue has enabled us to \r\nmake significant progress in resolving differences and \r\nbuilding an effective, lasting and sustainable peace, \r\nwhich has gone a long way to creating an environment \r\nconducive to strengthening national unity and \r\nreconciliation and restoring our economy. After I was \r\nsworn in as Head of State in January 2015, I decided \r\nto personally commit to the quest for peace. I made \r\nthat commitment because my country and people were \r\nstill struggling with tragic conflicts, fomenting wars \r\nand punishing the people. Happily, the weapons in \r\nmy country have been silent for more than two years \r\nnow, thanks to the direct dialogue I engaged in with \r\nthe late leader of the Mozambican National Resistance \r\nMovement. There is now a consensus on all that we \r\nhave accomplished in my country, and peace has been \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n40/49 18-29775\r\nmy biggest achievement as President. In July, as a \r\nresult of our dialogue, Mozambique saw our Assembly \r\nenact a bill amending our Constitution and changing \r\nour electoral laws, introducing innovative elements \r\nto our efforts to decentralize the country with a view \r\nto settling post-electoral conflict and strengthening \r\nour democracy.\r\nThose concrete steps in the political dialogue are \r\nan indelible landmark in our country’s multiparty \r\nhistory, as we intend, unlike in previous election \r\ncycles, to hold our next general election without any \r\narmed political parties. A process of disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration is therefore under way \r\nfor the remaining armed elements of the opposition. As \r\nproof that Mozambique is genuinely pro-democracy, \r\non 10 October we will hold municipal elections in 53 \r\nmunicipalities, with the participation of many political \r\nparties and civil-society associations. At the end of \r\nnext year we will hold general elections in line with \r\nthe agreement by consensus approved by the Assembly \r\nof the Republic. Considering the complexity of this \r\nissue, both financially and technically, my Government \r\nwould like to take this solemn opportunity to thank \r\nthe international community for its support and help, \r\nwhich is not easy to obtain. We still have more work to \r\ndo to achieve peace, reconciliation and development, \r\nand we therefore appeal for more assistance to enable \r\nus to ensure the success of the process of disarming, \r\ndemobilizing and reintegrating the remaining armed \r\nelements, which will begin soon.\r\nThe people of Mozambique are determined to live \r\nin peace, and my Government is also committed to \r\nfighting the organized crime that is destabilizing and \r\nthreatening our efforts to achieve national development. \r\nWe are determined to neutralize the groups of criminals \r\nthat are trying to disrupt public order and tranquillity in \r\nsome parts of the northern province of Cabo Delgado. \r\nWe need everyone to collaborate with us in combating \r\nthose criminals, because their crimes are global, \r\ninvolving nationals and non-nationals. We cannot think \r\nabout democracy or human rights when humankind’s \r\nfundamental right to life is at risk.\r\nMozambique takes its commitments to the \r\nSustainable Development Goals very responsibly, and \r\nwe therefore aligned our 2015 national agenda with the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We believe \r\nfirmly that we can create a more just, equitable society \r\nwith greater solidarity by implementing the Goals. They \r\nrepresent a basis on which we can broaden social justice \r\nin our country. My Government has made tremendous \r\nefforts to implement our national agenda so as to create \r\nmore opportunities for our citizens, particularly women \r\nand young people, within a framework of ensuring \r\ndemocratic dividends in our society.\r\nMaking the United Nations relevant to everyone \r\nmeans leaving no one behind, a hugely important \r\naim that we must not neglect. We should therefore \r\ngive special attention to policies and strategies aimed \r\nat protecting people’s full enjoyment of their rights, \r\npromoting gender equality and improving capacity-\r\nbuilding for women, young people and other vulnerable \r\ngroups, who make up the majority of our people. Social \r\njustice also demands that we promote gender equality, \r\nan area where we have had made significant progress at \r\nthe political, economic and corporate levels.\r\nWe have also undertaken efforts to increase access \r\nto basic health, education, water and sanitation services \r\nfor all. Another key element we are working on to \r\nsolidify the relevance of the United Nations for our \r\npeople is ensuring their food and nutritional security \r\nby prioritizing agriculture in our national development \r\nstrategy. Since our new governance cycle began in \r\n2015, we have mobilized our domestic resources and \r\nencouraged hard work by all, and have increased our \r\nagricultural and livestock productivity, with the aim of \r\nachieving one of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nthe elimination of hunger by 2030, which will require \r\nstill more public and private investment.\r\nWith regard to combating corruption, another \r\nscourge that impedes our ability to achieve our global, \r\nregional and national goals, my Government has \r\npromoted measures designed to improve every aspect \r\nof governance, political, economic and corporate \r\nby enacting laws, policies and strategies for fighting \r\ncorruption. We continue to strengthen our institutional \r\nand human capacity to ensure the enforcement of our \r\nanti-corruption laws and to raise awareness of this \r\nscourge’s damaging effects among all members of \r\nsociety and institutions. We must always uphold the \r\nprinciple of the separation of institutional powers.\r\nWith regard to climate change, Mozambique, as a \r\ncountry very vulnerable to its effects, has continued to \r\ntake measures for adaptation and resilience within the \r\nframework of the Paris Agreement, which we ratified \r\nin June. We have adopted a policy of biodiversity \r\nconservation to which 25 per cent of our territory is \r\ndedicated. We have also promoted the development of \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 41/49\r\ncommunities in the conservation area and encouraged \r\ntheir involvement in protecting and preserving our \r\nvaluable natural resources. We have fostered the use \r\nof renewable energies in rural areas, the sustainable \r\nmanagement of natural resources, the conservation \r\nof ecosystems and biodiversity, and benefit-sharing. I \r\nwould like to appeal from this rostrum for international \r\nfinancial and technological cooperation in strengthening \r\nour capacity to continue our efforts.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the \r\nunconditional commitment of the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique to the critical role of the \r\nUnited Nations in finding solutions to the problems \r\naff licting humankind. The United Nations will always \r\nbe the platform that brings all of us together in a \r\ncollective commitment to the noble ideas on which this \r\nuniversal Organization was founded — saving future \r\ngenerations from the scourge for war and promoting \r\nsocial progress, better living conditions and greater \r\nfreedom. Let us continue to be faithful to the supreme \r\nideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand work together to build peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Mozambique for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic \r\nof Mozambique, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of \r\nJapan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Japan.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime \r\nMinister of Japan, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Abe (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): I have been accorded the \r\nprivilege of continuing to serve as Japan’s leader for the \r\nnext three years. As I address the General Assembly \r\ntoday for the sixth consecutive year, I do so with a \r\nfeeling of renewed resolve.\r\nIn the next three years, I will do everything in \r\nmy power to strengthen the free trade system and to \r\nrecast the post-war structure of international relations \r\nin North-East Asia. In my view, the Japanese people \r\nhave been very much hoping to see their national \r\nleaders serve as f lag bearers for free trade, since after \r\nthe war Japan enjoyed remarkable growth thanks to the \r\nadvantages of trading as a beneficiary of a free and open \r\neconomic system. That free trade system enabled the \r\ncountries of Asia to achieve take-off one after the other \r\nand fostered the middle class in all of them, against a \r\nbackdrop of the large-scale direct investment that Japan \r\nhas made in those countries since the 1980s. In every \r\ncase, that was made possible thanks to an international \r\neconomic system that was rules-based, free and open. \r\nIf Japan, the country that reaped the greatest benefits \r\nof all under that system, should ever fail in its support \r\nfor maintaining and strengthening that system, who \r\nelse should we expect to rise in support of it? Japan’s \r\nresponsibility is indeed tremendous.\r\nThis is also Japan’s mission, rooted in its own \r\nhistory. Other than the coal that supported modern \r\nJapan’s industrialization, our nation has had no other \r\nresources to speak of. But even though post-war Japan \r\nlacked resources, when it devoted itself to reaping the \r\nblessings of trade, it succeeded in realizing growth that \r\nwas called miraculous. Japan was the very first country \r\nto prove through its own experience the principle of the \r\nrelationship that exists between trade and growth and \r\nthat has now become common sense. Japan has now \r\ntaken on the mission of imparting the benefits of trade \r\nto the world.\r\nThere have been times when I have risen above \r\nintense domestic debates by waving the f lag of free \r\ntrade. There was no greater joy for me than when \r\nthe Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership \r\nAgreement took final shape and was quickly approved \r\nby our National Diet. In addition, Japan and the \r\nEuropean Union have signed an economic partnership \r\nagreement whose scale and scope are worthy of special \r\nmention in history. But that said, we must not be \r\ncomplacent. I will have to push my efforts up a notch \r\nand aim still farther ahead.\r\nIn addition to Japan’s commitment to the World \r\nTrade Organization, which is a given, I will make \r\nevery possible effort to conclude negotiations on a \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n42/49 18-29775\r\ncomprehensive regional economic partnership, which \r\nwill create an enormous free-trade area in East Asia. \r\nAnd above all, I value our new free, fair and reciprocal \r\ntrade talks with the United States. Japan and the \r\nUnited States have both advanced the free trade system \r\ninternationally for many years. That is evidenced \r\nby the fact that Japan’s direct investment has created \r\nemployment in the United States for some 856,000 \r\npeople nationwide — a number second only to what the \r\nUnited Kingdom has achieved. At present, in contrast \r\nto the 1.74 million vehicles exported annually from \r\nJapan to the United States, the number of Japanese cars \r\nmanufactured within the United States is 3.77 million. \r\nThat is a win-win situation at its finest. I intend for \r\nJapan and the United States to continue that kind of \r\nrelationship. But that is hardly unique to our bilateral \r\nties with the United States. Under the f lag of free trade, \r\nJapan has built up relations with many countries and \r\nregions where we can mutually assist one another, and \r\nwe will continue to do that going forward. In order to \r\nexpand free and fair economic rules, suitable for the \r\ntwenty-first century, into the vast region extending \r\nfrom Asia and the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, the \r\ncountries that have created the system and reaped the \r\ngreatest benefits from it — that is to say, countries like \r\nJapan — must lead the effort. That is what I believe.\r\nAt the beginning of my statement, I said that I \r\nwould do everything in my power to recast the long-\r\nstanding post-war structure of international relations \r\nin North-East Asia. Together with President Vladimir \r\nPutin I am now working to end the stalemate between \r\nour countries, which has seen no movement for \r\nmore than 70 years. President Putin and I met at the \r\nbeginning of this month in Vladivostok for our twenty-\r\nsecond summit meeting, and I will meet with him again \r\nin the near future. We must resolve the territorial issue \r\nbetween Japan and Russia and conclude a peace treaty \r\nbetween our two countries. Once a Japanese-Russian \r\npeace treaty is signed, peace and prosperity in East \r\nAsia will be more secure.\r\nAt this time last year in this very Hall, I strongly \r\nurged North Korea to tackle its issues relating to \r\nabductions, nuclear power and missiles (see A/72/\r\nPV.8). As someone who has called for the full \r\nimplementation of all the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions, I am extremely interested in the potential \r\nfor change in North Korea, which is now at a crossroads \r\nwhere it will either seize the historic opportunity it has \r\nbeen afforded or fail to do so. North Korea has both \r\nuntapped natural resources and a labour force whose \r\nproductivity can be greatly enhanced. Japan will not \r\nchange its policy of seeking to resolve our unhappy \r\npast history and normalize relations with North Korea \r\nonce the abduction, nuclear and missile issues are dealt \r\nwith. We will be unstinting in assisting North Korea \r\nto unleash its potential. However, there is one thing I \r\nmust reiterate over and over again. We will ensure that \r\nall Japanese abductees are returned. I am determined \r\nto make that a reality, and in order to resolve the issue, \r\nI am also ready to break through the wall of mutual \r\ndistrust between us and North Korea, make a new start \r\nand meet with Chairman Kim Jong Un face to face. \r\nWhile so far nothing has been decided regarding a \r\nsummit meeting between Japan and North Korea, I am \r\ndetermined that if we hold one it must help to resolve \r\nthe abductions issue.\r\nI also want to comment briefly on relations between \r\nJapan and China. The mutual visits at the leadership \r\nlevel that began this year will continue, with me visiting \r\nChina next month, to be followed by my invitation to \r\nPresident Xi Jinping to Japan, thereby expanding our \r\nbilateral relations and improving the stability of the \r\nentire region.\r\nWhen we have recast the current confrontational \r\ngeopolitical structure in North-East Asia, the maritime \r\ncorridor from the Arctic Ocean to the Sea of Japan \r\nand through the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean \r\nwill become increasingly important. Japan, which \r\nis located right above it and also possesses a vast \r\nexclusive economic zone, hopes that we can ensure \r\nstability and peace in those waters, as well as in the \r\nairspaces above them. The countries of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations lie at the confluence of the \r\nPacific and Indian Oceans, and in eras long past it was \r\nour forerunners, living in what we now call the Pacific \r\nisland countries, who crossed those two oceans to \r\nintroduce products to faraway East Africa. What I call \r\nour free and open Indo-Pacific strategy derives from \r\nour desire to preserve the blessings of open seas together \r\nwith those countries, as well as with the United States, \r\nAustralia, India and others, and indeed all countries and \r\npeoples who share those aims. What we must ensure \r\nis that the rule of law and a rules-based order control \r\nour broad and expansive seas and airspaces, and that \r\nthey in turn are backed by solid institutions — hence \r\nmy strategy.\r\nThe other day, foreign students in Japan proudly \r\nreturned to their home countries of Malaysia, the \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 43/49\r\nPhilippines and Sri Lanka with new academic degrees \r\nin hand, master’s degrees in maritime safety and \r\nsecurity policy that can be obtained only in Japan. As \r\nwell as the students that Japan’s Coast Guard sends \r\nto the programme, it also takes senior officials from \r\nvarious coast-guard authorities in countries all over \r\nAsia. The students who graduated the other day were \r\nthe third cohort to enter the programme. Maritime \r\norder is a matter not of power but of the rule of law and \r\na rules-based order. Every year, a class learning that \r\nenduring truth and taking it as a guiding principle for \r\ntheir lives will head out from Japan to the seas. That \r\nis very promising, and it is Japan’s noble mission to \r\ncultivate the people who will protect and defend a free \r\nand open Indo-Pacific.\r\nAs I was preparing this address, I created a new if \r\nmodest programme. At the beginning of 2019, we will \r\ninvite approximately 10 elementary and junior-high-\r\nschool teachers from the Gaza Strip to Japan. That will \r\nbe the first such group and we will continue to invite \r\nteachers every year. Teachers who come to a place \r\nsuch as Japan, so different for them both culturally and \r\nhistorically, will naturally see the situation in Gaza and \r\nthe Middle East in a wider perspective, and we hope \r\nthat the experience will enable them to see their own \r\nhometowns and region anew and work in a unique way \r\nto give them solace. It goes without saying that for peace \r\nto be achieved, efforts must be made on both sides. But \r\nhopefully this programme of ours will represent some \r\nhope for the teachers from Gaza and the children in \r\ntheir care. Twenty years from now, 200 teachers will \r\nhave had the experience of visiting Japan, and the \r\nstudents taught by them will number in the thousands. \r\nI look forward to that day.\r\nThe goal of Japanese diplomacy, which to some \r\nextent I have conveyed to the Assembly today, is to help \r\nto bring certainty to the future of the world and the \r\nregion. In addition, what I want is for the young people \r\nwho will live in the Japan of the future to vigorously \r\ntake on challenges. The duty of our generation is to \r\ncreate an environment conducive to that. It is as if a \r\nnew breeze is about to blow in Japan.\r\nAt the end of April and the beginning of May next \r\nyear, His Majesty the Emperor will abdicate and His \r\nImperial Highness the Crown Prince will succeed to \r\nthe throne. In fact, it is the first imperial succession in \r\n200 years to result from a sitting Emperor’s abdication, \r\nand in October 2019, we will welcome guests of honour \r\nfrom around the world who are coming to express their \r\ngood wishes. Next June, Japan will host the Group of \r\n20 summit. As Chair of the meeting, I intend to lead \r\nthe discussions about issues facing the international \r\ncommunity, including the state of the global economy \r\nand environmental issues. Soon after, in August, Japan \r\nwill host the seventh meeting of the Tokyo International \r\nConference on African Development. The Conference, \r\nwhich Japan has hosted diligently since 1993, has \r\nearned the unwavering trust of national leaders all \r\nacross Africa. At the Conference we will discuss \r\nuniversal health coverage, whose importance I have \r\nhighlighted a number of times. And lest we forget, next \r\nyear Japan hosts the Rugby World Cup, and in 2020 \r\nTokyo is hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games. \r\nOur eyes will continue to be fixed on the future.\r\nWhen Japan and the Japanese people fix their gaze \r\nsquarely on the future, Japan increases in vitality. \r\nJapanese citizens focused on the future will become \r\npeople who are determined to take on the responsibility \r\nof achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The \r\nnext generation of Japanese youth will be commendable \r\nf lag bearers for the United Nations spirit. I am absolutely \r\ncertain of that.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to say that in the light of the \r\nlack of progress in reforming the Security Council, the \r\nsignificance of the United Nations in the twenty-first-\r\ncentury world is already being severely questioned. \r\nBut that is precisely why Japan will never waver in its \r\ncontributions to the Organization. I will end by pledging \r\nthat Japan, alongside Secretary-General Guterres, will \r\npush forward with reform of both the Security Council \r\nand the United Nations as a whole.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Japan \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nikol Pashinyan, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Armenia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Armenia.\r\nMr. Nikol Pashinyan, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Armenia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Nikol Pashinyan, Prime \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n44/49 18-29775\r\nMinister of the Republic of Armenia, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Pashinyan (Armenia): First of all, I would like \r\nto congratulate Her Excellency Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés on her election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session. We hope \r\nthat the deliberations under her able leadership will \r\nbe fruitful.\r\nIt is a great honour to address the Assembly as a \r\nleader who has recently become the Prime Minister of \r\nArmenia as the result of a people’s revolution that is \r\nnow known as Armenia’s velvet revolution. I would like \r\nto take a moment to share the story of our victory over \r\nthe authoritarian rule that preceded that revolution. \r\nThe people of Armenia succeeded in bringing about an \r\nunforeseen and unprecedented revolution, which took \r\nplace without violence, victims or public disorder. That \r\nwas no coincidence, as our intention was to make a \r\nrevolution based on love and solidarity. From the very \r\nbeginning, we declared that we were ruling out violence \r\nof any kind. We declared that even if violence was used \r\nagainst us, we would not respond with violence. We \r\ndeclared that our response would be with raised and \r\nopen hands, smiles and love.\r\nWhen we started this political process there were just \r\na few dozens of us marching from Gyumri, Armenia’s \r\nsecond-largest city, to the capital, Yerevan. When we \r\nreached Yerevan and showed our determination and \r\ndevotion to the principle of non-violence, our entire \r\nnation rose up against the ruling regime in unity and \r\nsolidarity. We won without a single shot being fired \r\nand with no victims, through peaceful demonstrations \r\nalone. We succeeded against all expectations. Even \r\nwell-known experts and think tanks were sceptical \r\nabout our chances for victory. Against all odds, I was \r\nelected Prime Minister, and in a Parliament where I \r\nhad only four reliable votes, including my own. Yet it \r\nwas possible. It happened because people were firm \r\nin their demands, and the Parliament, which had been \r\nelected just a year before, had no choice but to follow \r\nthe people’s will.\r\nWhile that Parliament continues to operate today, it \r\nno longer represents the people’s will, as it also failed \r\nto do before and during the revolution. Why? The short \r\nanswer is that the elections that created it involved \r\nthe buying of votes on a massive scale, the misuse of \r\nadministrative resources, and oppression.\r\nAn important test of our ability to hold genuine \r\nfree, fair and competitive elections was the Yerevan \r\ncity council election that took place just before my \r\ndeparture for New York. The fact that for the first \r\ntime since Armenia became independent, all of the \r\nmain parties congratulated the winning candidate and \r\nnobody questioned the official results shows that a \r\ncompletely new political culture has been established \r\nin Armenia. In the same spirit, we are now getting \r\nready for snap parliamentary elections in our country. \r\nFree, fair and transparent elections will become an \r\nirreversible reality in Armenia and will bring strong \r\nand vibrant democratic institutions that function \r\nthrough a system of checks and balances. Protecting \r\nour citizens’ rights and ensuring freedom of speech and \r\nother forms of expression and of assembly are very high \r\non our Government’s agenda. From now on, there can \r\nbe no possibility of manipulating the electoral process \r\nand undermining the people’s trust.\r\nI would also like to stress that the current situation \r\nin Armenia is not just a change of Government or \r\nruling party. It represents the establishment of a new \r\npolitical and governance system, which we have \r\nnamed “the people’s direct rule” or “the people’s direct \r\ngovernance”. In order to institutionalize the system, we \r\nintend to guarantee the expression of the people’s will \r\nnot only through elections but also through local and \r\nnational referendums, in order to engage our people in \r\nthe decision-making process.\r\nHaving been a political prisoner myself, I \r\nunderstand how much it means to be able to speak out \r\nand decide one’s own future. Now that we have assumed \r\nour responsibilities, our team has a clear vision and the \r\nstrong political will we need to launch fundamental \r\nreforms aimed at eradicating corruption, creating \r\ntransparent, accountable and efficient governance \r\nmechanisms, safeguarding human rights and the rule of \r\nlaw, ensuring an independent judiciary and advancing \r\neconomic growth through a free and competitive \r\nbusiness environment and an atmosphere favourable \r\nto investment.\r\nDespite the radical transformation in our internal \r\npolitical life, our foreign policy agenda will not involve \r\nany U-turns. The continuity of Armenia’s foreign policy \r\nshows that our country is a predictable and reliable \r\npartner. Our international commitments are not subject \r\nto revision. Our position is clear: Armenia stands ready \r\nto have constructive dialogue and to cooperate with \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 45/49\r\nall partners. However, we do not intend to develop our \r\nrelations with one partner at the expense of another.\r\nWe underline the importance of the role of \r\nmultilateralism at the global and regional level. \r\nArmenia’s cooperation under the umbrella of the \r\nUnited Nations is comprehensive and vibrant. Without \r\ngoing into minute detail, I would like to mention our \r\ncontributions to global peace through the United \r\nNations-led and -supported peace operations, with their \r\nimpressive geographical scope, which extends from \r\nAfghanistan to Lebanon and from Kosovo to Mali. That \r\nhas special significance for our country. While we are \r\ndealing with serious security concerns, we realize that \r\nthe security of any one country is inextricably linked \r\nto that of all others and that global peace requires \r\nconcerted action.\r\nWe are a truly global nation, with hundreds of \r\nArmenian communities all around the world, which \r\nexplains Armenia’s sensitivity to global threats that \r\ncould put our fellow Armenians at risk in different \r\nparts of the world. The sizeable Armenian community \r\nin Syria is facing an existential threat from the \r\nongoing crisis there. Armenia has tried to contribute \r\nby dispatching humanitarian assistance to the most \r\nvulnerable regions, and we are ready to enhance our \r\nhumanitarian mission, aimed at meeting the most \r\npressing needs of our community in Syria. As a \r\nnation that has experienced the horrors of genocide, \r\nArmenians have a great awareness of security concerns \r\ninvolving their compatriots and are ready to do their \r\nutmost to protect them.\r\nThe peaceful resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh \r\nconflict continues to occupy a central place on our \r\nforeign policy agenda. The status and security of the \r\nRepublic of Artsakh is an absolute priority for Armenia \r\nin the negotiation process. Any attempt to resolve the \r\nconflict through military means represents a direct \r\nthreat to regional security, democracy and human rights. \r\nArmenia will continue its constructive engagement in \r\nthe peaceful resolution of the conflict within the format \r\nof the co-Chairs of the Minsk Group of the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which \r\nhas the only internationally recognized mandate to deal \r\nwith the conflict.\r\nAzerbaijan should change its disrespectful attitude \r\nto the negotiations, abandon the idea of any military \r\nsolution and implement all previous agreements. \r\nFurthermore, if Azerbaijan is truly committed to the \r\npeace process, it should start talking to the main subject \r\nof the conflict, Nagorno Karabakh. Azerbaijan declares \r\nat every possible occasion that Karabakh should be a \r\npart of its territory, while at the same time announcing \r\nthat it will not negotiate with Nagorno Karabakh. The \r\nquestion is how Azerbaijan can make a claim to Nagorno \r\nKarabakh without even speaking to it. Is that possible? \r\nIt is possible only if the Azerbaijani Government wants \r\nthe territory, but not the people in it. It therefore becomes \r\nobvious that the Azerbaijani leadership’s intention \r\nis to cleanse Armenians from Karabakh, as it did in \r\nNakhchivan. That entitles Nagorno Karabakh to argue \r\nthat if Karabakh were to become a part of Azerbaijan \r\nit would mean its total extermination. Karabakh must \r\ntherefore not become a part of Azerbaijan unless we \r\nwant to trigger a new Armenian genocide.\r\nTo sum up, let me reiterate that the conflict can \r\nand should be settled only through mutual compromise \r\non all sides, in an atmosphere conducive to peace, not \r\nwar. Last but not least, I would also like to express my \r\nsatisfaction to the Secretary-General for his unwavering \r\nsupport to the OSCE Minsk Group co-Chairs’ approach \r\nand the related efforts.\r\nThe topic of our deliberations, “Making the United \r\nNations relevant to all people: global leadership and \r\nshared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and \r\nsustainable societies”, shows the consistent nature \r\nof our approach to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nThe United Nations and its development agenda should \r\nindeed be relevant and accessible to all. No one should \r\nbe left behind, as we keep repeating in our collective \r\nefforts. Earlier this year, in July, Armenia presented its \r\nfirst voluntary national report on the implementation of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals at the High-level \r\nPolitical Forum on Sustainable Development. That \r\nimportant exercise coincided with a decisive political \r\nperiod animated by vibrant democratic processes and \r\nthe launch of a wide range of reforms in my country. \r\nArmenia is committed to the creation and development \r\nof a knowledge-based, innovative platform that will \r\nleverage the impact and accelerate the implementation \r\nof the development agenda.\r\nIn that regard, we recognize the indispensable role \r\nof the United Nations and its specialized agencies, as \r\nwell as the importance of cooperation in working with \r\nother potential partners. As a newly elected member \r\nof the Economic and Social Council and a candidate \r\nfor the Human Rights Council for the 2020-2022 \r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n46/49 18-29775\r\nterm, Armenia will do its utmost to contribute to the \r\nrealization of the Sustainable Development Goals and \r\nto the protection and promotion of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms.\r\nThis is the year when we mark the seventieth \r\nanniversary of two of our most important human rights \r\ndocuments, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nand the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment \r\nof the Crime of Genocide. Each has its own history, \r\nand each has become a cornerstone for the development \r\nof international law. They served as the basis on \r\nwhich Armenia launched the Global Forum against \r\nthe Crime of Genocide. This year the Global Forum \r\nwill be dedicated to issues of genocide prevention \r\nthrough education, culture and museums. I encourage \r\ndelegations to come and contribute to the work of \r\nthe Forum.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\n“Living together” is the theme of the seventeenth \r\nsummit of the International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie, which will be held in October in \r\nYerevan, the capital of Armenia, a city that is some \r\n2,800 years old. It is a great honour and a privilege \r\nfor Armenia to be part of the wider French-speaking \r\nfamily and to promote tolerance and mutual respect \r\nthrough cooperation in the areas of culture, education \r\nand innovation. I reiterate once again our invitation to \r\ndelegations to attend the summit of La Francophonie \r\nwith several events planned within that framework.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Armenia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Nikol Pashinyan, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Armenia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. M. Saad-Eddine El Othmani, \r\nHead of Government of the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco\r\nMr. M. Saad-Eddine El Othmani, Head of \r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Morocco, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. M. Saad-Eddine El \r\nOthmani, Head of Government of the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. El Othmani (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAt the outset, I have the pleasure of congratulating \r\nMs. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-third \r\nsession. I wish her every success in her noble task.\r\nI would also like to express my appreciation for the \r\ntireless efforts of Secretary-General António Guterres \r\nin reforming our Organization, strengthening its role \r\nand achieving its noble objectives. I reiterate Morocco’s \r\nfull support for his initiatives, especially in the areas \r\nof peacekeeping, peacebuilding, modernizing the \r\nworking mechanisms of the Organization and achieving \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe world is facing various challenges and resulting \r\ntransformations that require us to adopt innovative \r\napproaches in order to advance multilateralism, which \r\nis suffering a real crisis. We therefore need to define \r\nconsensus concepts in addressing global issues and \r\nmaking international organizations effective and able \r\nto adapt to continuing transformation. Addressing and \r\ndebating this reality is not merely an intellectual act \r\nbut an explicit call to think realistically and objectively \r\nabout the outcomes of the United Nations work with the \r\naim of promoting its capabilities and realizing its goals.\r\nIn this context, Morocco, through the vision of \r\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI, believes that the \r\ndevelopment of multilateral action requires particular \r\nattention to the three pillars of security, development \r\nand human rights. The year 2018 has furthered the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in \r\n2015. It is also a year in which we recall two historic \r\nevents in our collective undertaking that established \r\nthe identity of the United Nations, devoted to shared, \r\nuniversal human values and entrenched international \r\npeace and security.\r\nThe first historic event took place 70 years ago, \r\nwhen the United Nations deployed its first peacekeeping \r\nmission. That leads us to recall the fundamental role \r\nthat the Organization plays in peacekeeping, based on \r\nthe peaceful resolution of international and regional \r\ndisputes, respect for the sovereignty of States and their \r\nterritorial integrity and independence. At the sixty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly, His Majesty \r\nKing Mohamed VI, through Prince Moulay Rachid, \r\nunderscored from this rostrum that\r\n“[a]chieving international peace and security \r\nremains the core historic mission entrusted to the \r\nUnited Nations. The tens of thousands of United \r\nNations peacekeepers serving throughout the world \r\nto protect civilians and working to bring about the \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 47/49\r\nright conditions for political dialogue between the \r\nconcerned parties clearly attest to the vital role \r\nplayed by our Organization in that regard.” (A/67/\r\nPV.16, p. 10).\r\nIn his letter addressed to the Secretary-General \r\nearly this month, His Majesty also underlined the \r\nappreciation of the Kingdom of Morocco for his \r\ninitiative to organize a high-level meeting during this \r\nsession on developing the work of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. Morocco fully supports the \r\nfinal communiqué of the meeting.\r\nThe second historic event is the adoption on \r\n10 December 1948 of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, the seventieth anniversary of which \r\nwe will celebrate this year. The Declaration laid the \r\nfirst foundation stone for universal human rights, \r\nleading to established joint universal values in the \r\narea of human rights. It also served as an incentive \r\nto adopt other international conventions on civil, \r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural rights. In that \r\nregard, Morocco underscores its commitment to human \r\nrights as internationally recognized. We call once \r\nagain for the noble principles of human rights to be \r\nelements of convergence among nations, without any \r\nbiased politicization.\r\nMultilateral work that is based on balance, realism, \r\neffectiveness, openness and ambition is among the \r\npriorities of the foreign policy of the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco, as established by King Mohammed. Now \r\nmore than ever we need to work together to identify \r\nconsensus approaches based on humanity and solidarity \r\nin order to address shared challenges, particularly with \r\nrespect to climate change, the fight against terrorism, \r\nand migration. It is in this spirit that His Majesty \r\nhas launched an effort to mobilize the world to limit \r\nthe impact of climate change. He made the United \r\nNations Climate Change Conference held in Morocco \r\na historical event for implementing the commitments \r\nundertaken at the Paris Climate Change Conference.\r\nIn the same spirit, Morocco has contributed with \r\nresolve and firmness to international cooperation in the \r\nfight against terrorism and cross-border security threats. \r\nGiven our recognized experience, we have contributed \r\nto developing international, regional and national \r\napproaches in that regard. The Kingdom of Morocco \r\nhas continued its contribution to mobilize international \r\nefforts to combat terrorism, including through its joint \r\npresidency, together with the Netherlands, of the Global \r\nCounterterrorism Forum.\r\nOn the subject of migration, King Mohammed, as a \r\npioneer in migration policies within the African Union, \r\npresented the African Agenda on Migration, which was \r\nadopted in Addis Ababa at the thirty-first summit of the \r\nAfrican Union, in January 2018. At the international \r\nlevel, Morocco, together with Germany, co-chairs \r\nthe Global Forum on Migration. The outcomes of \r\nthese international and African events have helped \r\nto strengthen the preparations for the global compact \r\nfor migration.\r\nIn the past few months, and for the first time in \r\nhistory, negotiations have resulted in an international \r\nconsensus on a global compact for safe, orderly and \r\nregular migration, which will be adopted at a high-\r\nlevel meeting scheduled to take place in Marrakech, in \r\nMorocco, on 10 and 11 December. That meeting will be \r\na historically transformative moment in dealing with \r\nmigration. It will establish a new global order based on \r\ndialogue, consultation and cooperation, while positively \r\naddressing migration as a fundamental human dynamic \r\nin the development of societies, bringing civilizations \r\ncloser together and achieving development. Everyone \r\nis, of course, welcome in Marrakech.\r\nGiven our firmly anchored African identity and \r\nour close historic and human ties with the African \r\ncountries, Morocco has made its relations with the \r\nAfrican continent one of the top priorities of its foreign \r\npolicy, within a framework of integrated and proactive \r\nstrategic vision. Morocco is proud of its African nature \r\nand of its distinctive relations with its African brothers. \r\nKing Mohammed is eager to propose African solutions \r\nto every African problem on the international agenda \r\nin order to support African and international efforts to \r\nattain peace, development and good governance.\r\nMorocco supports all initiatives to achieve \r\nprosperity and stability on the African continent, which \r\nis why we are honoured to co-chair the Sustainability, \r\nSecurity and Stability initiative with Senegal, seeking \r\nto combat desertification in Africa by reclaiming arid \r\nlands and providing stability for their inhabitants, \r\nenabling them and their families to live a decent life. I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to call on the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to actively participate \r\nin the success of this important event related to Africa \r\nand its development.\r\nA/73/PV.7 25/09/2018\r\n48/49 18-29775\r\nMorocco is a member of the African Peace \r\nand Security Council and intends to shoulder its \r\nresponsibility for mobilizing every effort to preserve \r\nsecurity and peace while promoting stability on the \r\nAfrican continent, in support of United Nations efforts \r\nin this area.\r\nThe dangers facing the Middle East demand that \r\nwe come up with a just and lasting solution to the \r\nPalestinian question, which is at the heart of the conflicts \r\nin the region, along with its security and stability. The \r\nKingdom of Morocco calls on the United Nations to \r\nfocus its efforts on relaunching the political process on \r\na basis of the relevant international and bilateral terms \r\nof reference so that the Palestinian people can enjoy \r\ntheir legitimate rights, particularly the creation of an \r\nindependent State across the entire Palestinian national \r\nterritory, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco is aware of the importance \r\nof Jerusalem to the three monotheistic religions and \r\nthe whole world. I emphasize that Morocco rejects \r\nany change to the historic, legal and political status of \r\nthe city of Jerusalem, in the light of the fact that King \r\nMohammed presides over the Al-Quds Committee. We \r\ncall for international efforts to maintain its status and \r\nprotect it against any action targeting it.\r\nAnother source of concern in the Middle East and \r\nNorth Africa is the interference of certain regional \r\nPowers in the internal affairs of some Arab countries, \r\nincluding the Kingdom of Morocco, which undermines \r\ntheir security and stability and threatens their \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity. \r\nMorocco wants to take this opportunity to reaffirm \r\nits rejection and condemnation of such aggressive and \r\ndestructive attitudes. We call on those Powers to refrain \r\nfrom this approach, which runs counter to international \r\nlaw, international relations and the principle of good-\r\nneighbourliness. We call on them to adopt informed \r\noptions and to sincerely and courageously participate \r\nin establishing a safe, stable and welcoming region.\r\nThe contrived regional dispute over Western Sahara \r\nremains a principal source of instability in the region \r\nand an obstacle to joint action and the integration of the \r\nMaghreb. That is why it is essential to work diligently \r\nto find a lasting political solution through efforts in \r\nwhich Algeria, if it is serious, should be effectively \r\nand directly involved, given its historical and political \r\nresponsibility for creating, fuelling and prolonging \r\nthe dispute.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco underlines its full \r\ncommitment to the terms of reference adopted by the \r\nSecurity Council to address this contrived dispute. The \r\nCouncil is the only international body mandated to \r\naddress the political aspect of the dispute, by adopting \r\na spirit of realism and consensus and working to reach \r\na realistic, practical and lasting solution, as provided \r\nfor in the Council’s resolutions, particularly resolution \r\n2414 (2018). In that regard, Morocco underscores its \r\nsupport for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his \r\nPersonal Envoy for Western Sahara, aimed at achieving \r\na final and agreed political solution to this dispute, \r\nbased on the position expressed by King Mohammed \r\nin his address on the sixty-fifth anniversary of the \r\nRevolution of the King and the People, on 20 August. \r\nHis Majesty stressed that Morocco will continue to\r\n“engage with full trust and commitment in the \r\ndynamic work generated by the Secretary-General \r\nand his Personal Envoy, based on the same terms \r\nof reference that we identified in the last Green \r\nMarch address. We note with satisfaction the \r\ngrowing harmony between these principles and the \r\ninternational positions”.\r\nIn parallel, Morocco continues to make every effort \r\nto promote the development model in the southern \r\nSahara. We support an advanced, decentralized system \r\nthat would enable the inhabitants of the Moroccan \r\nSahara to manage their own affairs in an environment \r\nof democracy, stability and sustainable development.\r\nIt is with deep regret that we recall the disastrous \r\nsituation in which our detained brothers are living \r\nin the camps at Tindouf. We reiterate our firm and \r\nnon-negotiable demand for the international community \r\nto compel Algeria to assume all its political, legal and \r\nhumanitarian responsibilities as the host country. It \r\nshould allow the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees to carry out its mandate \r\nby conducting a census of those people, on the basis \r\nof Security Council resolutions and in response to the \r\nnumerous appeals made by the Secretary General and \r\nvarious humanitarian bodies over the years.\r\nWe firmly believe that the major changes and \r\ntransformations in our world today require urgent, \r\nstrong and concerted efforts on the part of all members \r\nof the international community, whoever they are and \r\nregardless of their interests. Multilateralism is contrary \r\nto isolation and to perpetuating the status quo. It is a \r\nsymbol of progress, understanding and adaptation. The \r\n25/09/2018 A/73/PV.7\r\n18-29775 49/49\r\nmultilateral system, despite the criticism it faces, will \r\nremain essential to addressing the challenges and issues \r\nfacing the international community.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco will continue to be an \r\nactive and responsible Member of the United Nations \r\nand the international community. The Kingdom of \r\nMorocco will continue to believe in the principles of \r\nthe Organization, in which we have confidence, thanks \r\nto its multilateral work.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of Government \r\nof the Kingdom of Morocco for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. M. Saad-Eddine El Othmani, Head of \r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Morocco, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.10 p.m.\r\n"
