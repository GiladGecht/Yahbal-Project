"United Nations A/73/PV.8\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n8th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 26 September 2018, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Santos Maraver \r\n(Spain), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Panama.\r\nMr. Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Juan \r\nCarlos Varela Rodríguez, President of the Republic of \r\nPanama, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Varela Rodríguez (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI extend my greetings to the President of the General \r\nAssembly, Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, whom \r\nI wish to recognize as the first Latin American woman \r\nto serve the United Nations in this capacity.\r\nI also recognize Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres for his renewed commitment to the \r\nOrganization. To the people of Panama, I express once \r\nagain, from this rostrum, my gratitude for having been \r\ngiven the opportunity to serve them.\r\nAs I return to the General Assembly for the seventh \r\ntime, I am drawing to a close my chapter as Head of \r\nState. In just a few months, I will open a new one as \r\na citizen of the world, but one who is determined to \r\ncontinue supporting the efforts of this institution, \r\nfighting for peace and social justice and following \r\nthe example of great leaders like Nelson Mandela and \r\nKofi Annan.\r\nOver these years, I have borne witness to the \r\ndeliberations and efforts of the United Nations aimed at \r\nfostering harmony in the world. Some of the leaders I \r\nhave listened to in this Hall are no longer with us; some \r\nleft in peace and others in violent circumstances.\r\nWe have achieved ambitious goals, from the \r\napproval of the Sustainable Development Goals to \r\nthe commitment to fulfilling them by 2030. Many \r\nchallenges remain, such as achieving peace in Syria. \r\nThe theme of the present session spurs us to reflect on \r\nthe following question: are we as leaders doing enough \r\nfor the Organization to have a real impact on people’s \r\nlives? The answer lies in the commitment of those of \r\nus entrusted with the leadership of our countries as we \r\nenter the future.\r\nThe Organization was founded on the conviction \r\nthat world leaders should be able to forge a path to \r\nresolve disputes by peaceful means. As we attend \r\nthis annual gathering, we bear the responsibility to \r\nrealize that dream of peace and brotherhood. Peace is \r\nthreatened not only by weapons but also by injustice, \r\npoverty, hunger, inequality and the lack of opportunity \r\nexperienced by our people. Therefore, as part of our \r\ncommitment in adopting the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals as national policy, our Government has, over the \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

We have rebuilt entire cities, and more than \r\n100,000 Panamanian families will have new homes so \r\nthat their children may lead a life of dignity.\r\nThrough a massive health census, we have identified \r\nthe principal diseases affecting our citizens, allowing \r\nus to provide preventive health treatment.\r\nWe are transforming the Panamanian education \r\nsystem, making it bilingual and more equitable. More \r\nthan 6,000 Panamanian teachers have been trained \r\nabroad to teach English and more than 3,000 new \r\nclassrooms are being built for our students. Moreover, \r\nwe have strengthened the system of higher technical \r\neducation. I am very proud to share with the Assembly \r\nthe fact that, as we speak, a team of Panamanian \r\ninstructors is teaching English to Syrian refugee \r\nchildren in the Za’atari camp in Jordan.\r\nThanks to record investments, we are providing \r\nmodern sanitation systems to several cities across \r\nthe country and building new water-treatment plants \r\nto markedly expand access to drinking water. We \r\nlead Latin America in terms of investment in urban \r\nmobility, with 2,000 kilometres of new roads, and 22 \r\nkilometres of metro about to become operational and \r\nconstruction beginning on a further 26 kilometres. We \r\nhave cut insecurity by 50 per cent, rescued thousands \r\nof young people from criminal gangs, and strengthened \r\nthe capacities of law enforcement.\r\nToday’s Panama is very different from the \r\ncountry whose leadership I assumed in 2014. Before \r\nall Panamanians and the entire world, today I can \r\nsay with my head held high that we have succeeded \r\nin transforming politics into public service and in \r\nrebuilding our democracy to be one that works for \r\nfuture generations. I have governed my country in \r\npeace, using dialogue and consensus, invoking the \r\npower of the State only to protect the people, not to \r\nthwart them. I have held true to the words I spoke on \r\nmy first day in office by fighting corruption head on \r\nand ensuring that no one is above the law.\r\nMany challenges remain ahead. The judicial system \r\nstill faces significant challenges to ensure that there is \r\nno impunity. We have worked tirelessly to strengthen \r\nour institutions and consolidate our young democracy, \r\nrespecting and supporting the elected authorities from \r\nall political parties and their communities, and boosting \r\ntheir economic capacities.\r\nNext year, Panama will hold its seventh democratic \r\nelections, with an electoral body that has proven an \r\neffective guarantor of transparent democracy. Thanks \r\nto the far-reaching electoral reforms that we have \r\npursued, the forthcoming campaign will be the fairest, \r\nshortest and most transparent in our history. For the \r\nfirst time, all responsibility for the financing of media \r\ncampaigns will lie with the State.\r\nWe continue to strengthen our status as a connected \r\ncountry, with excellent aviation links, strengthened \r\nby a new airport; maritime connectivity, enhanced \r\nby the expanded Canal and new ports; and human \r\nconnectivity, whereby our geographical position and \r\nfacilities such as a new convention centre and cruise \r\nport will play an important role. We have a logistics \r\nand financial platform at the service of global trade, \r\nand we defend and protect it so as to ensure that it is not \r\nused for illicit activities. We have seen the successful \r\nexpansion of the Canal, which reflects the principles \r\nof our country: our ability to unite the world, our \r\npermanent neutrality and our openness to global trade. \r\nThis interoceanic link was restored to the people of \r\nPanama thanks to the Panama Canal treaties and the \r\ncourageous decision of a simple human being, former \r\nPresident of the United States Jimmy Carter, whose \r\ncommitment, I publicly acknowledge today, changed \r\nthe course of our nation’s history.\r\nWhile we have experienced difficult situations that \r\nhave affected our national image, we have been able to \r\nmove on based on the principle that justice becomes \r\nunjust when it ceases to protect the innocent. We have \r\ndemonstrated to the world that our country and its \r\neconomy have succeeded thanks solely to the honest \r\nwork of our people. Through our efforts in recent years \r\nto attain the Sustainable Development Goals, we have \r\nlifted more than 150,000 Panamanians out of poverty, \r\nwhich means a reduction of 5 percentage points, from 25 \r\nto 20 per cent, and maintained average annual economic \r\ngrowth of 5 per cent. We are strengthening the social \r\nprotection system for the elderly and students. We have \r\nmade major improvements to hospital infrastructure, \r\neducation, school attendance, access to drinking water, \r\neducation and housing.\r\nWe have also extended a dignified welcome to \r\ntens of thousands of citizens from other countries who \r\nhave come to our land seeking a better future for their \r\nfamilies. We witnessed the migratory crisis whereby \r\nmore than 100,000 Haitians left for Brazil following \r\nthe big earthquake in January 2010. Once in Brazil, \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 3/52\r\nthey were forced to migrate yet again as a result of the \r\neconomic crisis there. Many lives were lost along the \r\nway. I recognize the leadership displayed by Chile in \r\nsolving this human tragedy by opening its doors.\r\nI see the tragedy of migration in the face of Juan, a \r\n7-year-old African boy who now lives alone in Panama \r\nbecause he lost his mother as they walked across the \r\nmountains between Panama and Colombia. That child \r\nforged in the depths of my heart a commitment that \r\ncountries must better manage migratory f lows, in a \r\nmore organized manner, while respecting the rights \r\nof all human beings to seek better living conditions. \r\nThousands of migrants from other continents cross our \r\nborder with Colombia through the dangerous Darién \r\njungle, risking their lives in the hope of realizing their \r\ndreams. The lessons learned from these migratory \r\ncrises compel us to call vigorously once again on the \r\nGovernment of Venezuela to restore political dialogue \r\nand a peaceful society based on democracy, so as to \r\navoid further mass migration and the humanitarian \r\ncrisis of Venezuelans seeking to meet their basic needs.\r\nSuch migratory f lows can be stemmed only by \r\neliminating the reasons for which citizens leave their \r\ncountries, risking their safety and that of their families. \r\nThat represents a significant challenge for the United \r\nNations. We actively participated in the development \r\nof the global compact for safe, orderly and regular \r\nmigration, to be adopted under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations this year, with the aim of contributing, \r\nbased on our experience, to the global framework for \r\ntackling such crises. Our countries bear a responsibility \r\nto develop policies to manage migratory f lows in an \r\norderly manner with respect for human dignity. In the \r\ncoming days, Panama will announce humanitarian \r\nmeasures to support the Venezuelan families residing \r\nin our country.\r\nPanama is a great melting pot, comprising citizens \r\nfrom the world over who came and made a new home \r\nin our beautiful land. We have learned to live in peace, \r\nrespecting all religious beliefs, political ideologies \r\nand philosophies. In this age of communication and \r\nsocial networks, there is no room for discrimination \r\nof any kind. We are all citizens of this planet. This \r\nis our home. Reported violations of the human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms of the brotherly people of \r\nNicaragua risk triggering yet another migratory f low \r\nin Central America. I call once again on Nicaragua’s \r\nGovernment and civil-society actors to restore peace \r\nthrough political dialogue.\r\nIn 2015, Panama served as host for the historic \r\nrapprochement between Cuba and the United States. I \r\ntake this opportunity to reiterate the call for a return \r\nto that path and for recognition of the steps taken by \r\nthe Government of Cuba to open its economy for the \r\nbenefit the Cuban people and the island’s economic and \r\nsocial development.\r\nI wish to stress that, although our continent is at \r\npeace, the political crisis in Venezuela, rising drug \r\nproduction in Colombia, the corruption affecting so \r\nmany economies in the region and the tense situation \r\nin Nicaragua are challenges calling for the region’s \r\npolitical leaders to redouble their efforts to seek \r\ncompromises to restore peace to those societies.\r\nIn the fight against drug trafficking, Panama will \r\nrefocus its strategy to go beyond drug interdiction and \r\ncriminal arrests to rebuild communities and support \r\npeople in cutting ties with illegal groups and living as \r\nloyal citizens of the State.\r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to be among the \r\nleading nations that work together with multilateral \r\norganizations for a better world. In that regard, in \r\nNovember we will inaugurate, in the presence of the \r\nForeign Ministers of Central America and the Caribbean, \r\nthe Regional Logistics Centre for Humanitarian \r\nAssistance. Panama is putting its connectivity at the \r\nservice of the region to respond to natural disasters and \r\nemergencies across the continent.\r\nWhile respecting different systems of government, \r\nI believe that politics in future will be not only about \r\nhow to obtain power but also how to use it for the good \r\nof the people. Based on our firm belief in the need \r\nto build a fairer and more peaceful world, Panama is \r\nworking to broaden its bilateral relations with countries \r\nof South-East Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and \r\nwith Australia and China, as a means of getting closer \r\nto the world and of fulfilling our role as a builder of \r\nbridges. \r\nOver the past 10 years, I have had opportunities \r\nto visit more than 40 countries and become acquainted \r\nat first hand with best practices, technology and \r\ncooperation programmes, which we have been \r\nable to use in my country. Such is the nature of \r\ndiplomacy — using our abilities to help, and not destroy, \r\none another. Accordingly, we are developing a monorail \r\nwith Japanese technology, a subway with French trains, \r\ntechnical higher education based on the Singaporean \r\nmodel and electric power plants fuelled by natural \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n4/52 18-29871\r\ngas with North American technology. In pursuing our \r\nvocation to be a bridge linking the world, Panama will \r\nhost World Youth Day in January 2019, to be attended \r\nby Pope Francis, which will bring together hundreds \r\nof thousands of young people from 192 countries and \r\nwill be focused on the shared goal of achieving peace \r\nto build a better world and overcome cultural and \r\nreligious barriers.\r\nI bid farewell to the General Assembly with a \r\npeaceful conscience, knowing that I have used the \r\npolitical power bestowed upon me by the people solely \r\nfor their benefit, while unwaveringly leading the \r\nstruggle. Panama’s success benefits not only Panama’s \r\npeople, but everyone. I wish to express today before the \r\nentire General Assembly and the world my commitment \r\nto continue working as a responsible citizen of the world, \r\ntogether with my people and all nations, to strengthen \r\nthe United Nations system and all its bodies so that the \r\ncitizens of our beautiful planet always remain the focus \r\nof our struggles and efforts.\r\n In conclusion, I share with members the pride \r\nthat I feel in having contributed to strengthening my \r\ncountry’s vocation as a bridge of peace, dialogue and \r\nsocial justice.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez, President of \r\nthe Republic of Panama, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hage Geingob, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Namibia.\r\nMr. Hage Geingob, President of the Republic \r\nof Namibia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hage Geingob, President of \r\nthe Republic of Namibia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Geingob: I wish to congratulate \r\nMs. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session.\r\nOn 21 July, the people of Namibia and our \r\nfriends around the world laid to rest our first Foreign \r\nMinister, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab. He represented our \r\nliberation movement, the South West Africa People’s \r\nOrganization, at the United Nations for more than 15 \r\nyears. Under his presidency at the fifty-fourth session \r\nof the General Assembly, we adopted the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, the precursor to the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. The family of Mr. Gurirab, \r\nthe Government and the people of the Republic of \r\nNamibia have been deeply touched by the outpouring \r\nof condolences and sympathies following his death. We \r\nare deeply appreciative of the memorial service held in \r\nhis honour here at Headquarters.\r\nTwo months ago, I travelled to Nigeria to bury former \r\nUnder-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of \r\nthe Economic Commission for Africa, Mr. Adebayo \r\nAdedeji, who stood by our side during our liberation. \r\nTwo weeks ago, I travelled to Accra for the burial of \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of \r\nthe Organization — a son of Africa whose f lame was \r\nextinguished but whose light will shine on throughout \r\nthe ages. A few days ago, in this very Hall, we gathered \r\nto pay tribute to that revered personality and architect \r\nof peace. He was a man of great stature who dedicated \r\nhis entire adult life to the pursuit of global peace and \r\nsecurity. May the souls of those distinguished sons of \r\nAfrica and of the United Nations rest in eternal peace.\r\nFollowing the end of the Cold War and the old \r\nbipolar dispensation, the world has slowly drifted \r\never more worryingly towards unilateral action. That \r\ndevelopment goes against one of the fundamental tenets \r\nof democracy upon which the Organization was built. It \r\nis for that reason that we must embrace multilateralism \r\nwith greater urgency to counter unilateral action. It is \r\nalso for the same reason that we fully concur with the \r\nSecretary-General’s sentiments, as expressed in his \r\nstatement in paragraph 1 of his report on the work of \r\nthe Organization (A/73/1), that,\r\n“As today’s problems grow ever more global, \r\nmultilateralism is more important than ever.”\r\nThe Republic of Namibia was founded on the \r\nprinciples of democracy, the rule of law and justice. \r\nThe fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 5/52\r\nour Constitution include virtually all of the rights and \r\nfreedoms recognized in international human rights \r\ninstruments. However, those instruments in and of \r\nthemselves are not sufficient to bring about sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Namibia recognizes that there are \r\nexisting and emerging threats and challenges that \r\ncontinue to frustrate individual and collective efforts \r\nto achieve greater socioeconomic progress. To that end, \r\nNamibia has embraced sustainable development and is \r\nfully committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and its principles, goals, targets and \r\nindicators. As a matter of fact, Namibia has integrated \r\nall 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their \r\ntargets into its national development plans. As a dry and \r\narid country, often affected by seasonal droughts and \r\nf loods, we have stepped up our efforts to implement \r\nthe SDGs in critical areas such as energy, water and \r\nterrestrial ecosystems. In that regard, Namibia wishes \r\nto benefit from the assistance to be provided by the \r\nTechnology Bank for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nestablished in Istanbul on 4 June, to identify and locate \r\ndrought and f lood areas in a timely manner.\r\nAlthough Namibia has witnessed sustained \r\neconomic growth over many of the past 10 years, \r\nunemployment remains persistently high. Nevertheless, \r\nNamibia has seen one of the most rapid decreases in \r\npoverty levels in our region over the past 10 years, from \r\n28.8 per cent to 17.4 per cent. I am also happy to inform \r\nthe Assembly that life expectancy in Namibia has risen \r\nfrom 58 to 65 years of age.\r\nHowever, inequality in Namibia remains a \r\nchallenge, as reflected in the skewed ownership of \r\nland, whereby white Namibians own 70 per cent of \r\nall agricultural land. As part of its efforts to create \r\nconditions favourable to fighting poverty and maintain \r\npeace and stability, Namibia will hold its second national \r\nland conference during the first week of October. In \r\npreparation for the conference, the Government has \r\nconducted consultations in all of our 14 regions so as to \r\nensure an inclusive process. We believe in consultations. \r\nIf diplomacy fails, people go to war. That is why we \r\nare pursuing an inclusive consultative process, with \r\nthe full knowledge that inclusivity spells harmony and \r\nexclusivity spells conflict. We have made a concerted \r\neffort to include as many stakeholders as possible and \r\nto ensure that everything will be done within the ambit \r\nof our laws. Accordingly, we call on our development \r\npartners to support the outcome of the conference so \r\nthat they can continue assisting us in the process of \r\nsocioeconomic transformation.\r\nI have stated before that Namibia’s classification \r\nas an upper-middle-income nation fails to consider the \r\nskewed distribution of income. That status prevents \r\nus from accessing official development assistance and \r\naffordable, concessional finance. The situation has the \r\npotential to jeopardize efforts in Namibia and other \r\ndeveloping countries to fully achieve the 2030 Agenda.\r\nCommunicable diseases also threaten to jeopardize \r\nour reaching the 2030 Agenda Goals. For that reason, \r\nNamibia endorses the call to end endemic tuberculosis \r\nand reaffirms its commitment to join the world in \r\nworking to achieve that goal. With a population of \r\napproximately 2.5 million people, Namibia ranks as \r\nthe ninth most tuberculosis-affected country in the \r\nworld, which is one of the top three causes leading \r\nto hospitalization. The Government of Namibia has \r\ndemonstrated its commitment to addressing that \r\ndisease by including related targets in its fifth national \r\ndevelopment plan, as well as by ensuring that 70 per \r\ncent of available funding for tuberculosis comes from \r\ndomestic resources.\r\nI should caution that inadequate human and \r\nfinancial resources, high levels of poverty and the \r\nlack of public-health services in rural areas remain a \r\nconcern. As the Chairperson of the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community (SADC), our country \r\nreaffirms its commitment to the African Union \r\nDeclaration on Malaria, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nother Related Infectious Diseases, working within the \r\nHarmonized Surveillance Framework for HIV and \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in the SADC Region, \r\nand will join the international community in the fight \r\nagainst tuberculosis.\r\nI congratulate the Secretary-General for launching \r\nthe United Nations Global Youth Strategy. Africa \r\nhas the fastest-growing youth population. In my \r\ncapacity as Chairperson of SADC, I wish to inform \r\nthe Assembly that the region has adopted a strategy \r\nto achieve industrialization by 2063. In that regard, \r\nthe thirty-eighth SADC Summit, held in Windhoek in \r\nAugust, adopted the theme “Promoting infrastructure \r\ndevelopment and youth empowerment for sustainable \r\ndevelopment”. We are convinced that the youth of \r\nthe SADC region, and of the world in general, are the \r\nfuture custodians of our social, political, economic and \r\ngovernance infrastructure. As such, young people need \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n6/52 18-29871\r\nto be provided with the requisite skills and training and \r\nbe economically empowered through entrepreneurship \r\nto drive development towards inclusive growth and \r\nshared prosperity. The youth of the SADC region, like \r\ntheir counterparts in the rest of the world, yearn for \r\nbetter prospects. They yearn for a future of opportunity \r\nand job certainty, wherein the fourth Industrial \r\nRevolution will represent opportunities, not threats. \r\nA future characterized by the rapid advancement of \r\ntechnology, advanced robotics, artificial intelligence \r\nand mechanization should present more opportunities, \r\nrather than problems, for our youth and for humankind \r\nin general. The onus is on us to mitigate the potential \r\nproblems that might accompany those technologies \r\nand to understand how they can be used to enable \r\nour youth to become drivers of economic growth and \r\nindustrial development.\r\nLet me emphasize that excluding women from \r\ncertain spheres of life is to waste skills and expertise that \r\ncould otherwise contribute to sustainable development. \r\nIn that context, we applaud the Secretary-General for \r\nexercising leadership and for reaching gender parity \r\nin the Secretariat among senior management and \r\nresident coordinators. Namibia is fully committed to \r\nimplementing gender equality, which is evident in the \r\nimportant role that women play in our politics. The \r\nlate former Secretary-General Kofi Annan was right \r\nwhen he said at the Conference on African Women and \r\nEconomic Development in Addis Ababa in April 1998,\r\n“Gender equality is more than a goal in itself. It is a \r\nprecondition for meeting the challenge of reducing \r\npoverty, promoting sustainable development and \r\nbuilding good governance”.\r\nThe world should do more to make gender equality \r\na reality.\r\nWhile we commend the Secretary-General on his \r\nsuccessful reform initiatives, I remind the Assembly of \r\nthe historic commitment that we all made at the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit\r\n“to strengthen the United Nations with a view \r\nto enhancing its authority and efficiency [and] \r\naddress effectively ... the full range of challenges \r\nof our time” (resolution 60/1, para. 146).\r\nIt is time to ensure that we live up to that pledge. In \r\nthat regard, it is pertinent to demonstrate the political \r\nwill of the United Nations membership with regard \r\nto redressing Africa’s exclusion from the Security \r\nCouncil. The world has moved on, and the old and \r\nunjust order cannot persist. Africa and its 1.2 billion \r\ninhabitants can no longer be excluded from assuming \r\ntheir place on that primary decision-making body.\r\nFor Africa and the rest of the developing world, \r\npeace is the main foundation for and guarantor of \r\nsustainable economic growth and development. As \r\nleaders, together with the citizenry of the great African \r\ncontinent, we need to understand that it is our collective \r\nresponsibility to maintain peace so as to enable Africa \r\nto unlock its full potential. Every step that advances \r\na peaceful Africa should be welcomed. In that vein, \r\nwe commend His Excellency Mr. Abiy Ahmed, Prime \r\nMinister of Ethiopia, and his Eritrean counterpart, His \r\nExcellency President Isaias Afwerki, for signing an \r\nagreement to end the war between their two countries \r\nand for the subsequent resumption of diplomatic and \r\ntrade ties. I am confident that that spirit of unity, peace \r\nand security, as embodied in the African Union’s \r\nAgenda 2063, will spread throughout the Horn of \r\nAfrica and all areas aff licted by conflict in Africa.\r\nNamibia is a child of international solidarity, in \r\nwhose birth the United Nations served as midwife. We \r\nrelied on the solidarity of the nations of the world to \r\nsupport us in our quest to achieve our self-determination. \r\nIn that connection, we call for the implementation of \r\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions and decisions \r\non the Western Sahara, which will lead to a positive, \r\npeaceful and permanent solution that meets the \r\naspirations and will of the people of that area. In the \r\nsame vein, we reaffirm our support for the people of \r\nthe occupied territory of Palestine in their pursuit of \r\nself-determination, justice, freedom and independence.\r\nDuring the darkest days of our fight for \r\nindependence, the Government and the people of Cuba \r\njoined Angola in coming to our aid and shedding their \r\nblood for our liberation, which led to the decisive battle \r\nof Cuito Cuanavale and the resulting negotiations, \r\nelections and, eventually, freedom. It is in that spirit of \r\nprofound kinship that we share with the Cuban people \r\nthat we renew our call for lifting the decades-old, \r\noutdated, ineffective and counterproductive economic \r\nand financial embargo on Cuba. It is now time for all \r\nof us to demonstrate the leadership required to bring \r\nprosperity and peace to all of the world’s people. \r\nIt is time to lead in the spirit of peace, equality and \r\nsustainability. It is time to make the United Nations \r\nrelevant to all of the world’s people. Let us seize this \r\nunique moment in history.\r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 7/52\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Namibia for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Hage Geingob, President of the Republic \r\nof Namibia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Ghana.\r\nMr. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, President \r\nof the Republic of Ghana, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Nana \r\nAddo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, President of the Republic \r\nof Ghana, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Akufo-Addo: Ghana salutes the historic \r\nelection of Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés to \r\npreside over the General Assembly at its seventy-third \r\nsession as the first female Latin American President \r\nof the General Assembly, and congratulates her most \r\nheartily. Her election reinforces our common belief \r\nthat gender equality must be a central feature of the \r\nglobal agenda.\r\nThirteen days ago, we laid to rest in his home \r\nsoil of Ghana our brother Kofi Annan, the seventh \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and the \r\nfirst from sub-Saharan Africa to occupy that exalted \r\nposition. On behalf of the Government and the people \r\nof Ghana, I wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to \r\nthe Secretariat, led by the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. António Guterres, and the whole world \r\ncommunity for the outpouring of grief and condolences \r\nthat we received on the passing of Kofi Annan. We were \r\ndeeply touched that so many world leaders and people \r\ntook the trouble to come to Accra to bid him farewell. \r\nKofi Annan’s passionate and profound belief in the \r\nUnited Nations and his certainty that a better organized \r\nand stronger United Nations would make the world a \r\nbetter place is an ideal that should not be allowed to die.\r\nToday we continue to be faced with the stark reality \r\nthat resolutions, norms and any number of votes in the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly mean \r\nnothing without the political will of the international \r\ncommunity to enforce them. We continue to try to work \r\nout what the role of the Organization should be. Should \r\nit be just a club of nation States that exists to look after \r\ntheir own interests? What of its formation by “we the \r\npeoples”, as declared in its founding document? Does \r\nthe theme that we have chosen for this session of the \r\nAssembly have any relevance in real life? And do we \r\nwant to make the United Nations relevant to all people? \r\nDo we want an Organization that ensures shared \r\nresponsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties, or should it remain a place where resolutions \r\nare adopted but ignored with impunity?\r\nWhen some of the nations of the world gathered in \r\nSan Francisco 73 years ago and signed the landmark \r\ndocument that created the Organization, the world \r\nwas very different from what we have today. I am not \r\nreferring only to the difference in the number of States \r\nin the room on that occasion or the difference in the \r\nmode of travel that brought the leaders to that meeting, \r\nas opposed to the jet planes that brought us all to New \r\nYork this week. I am not referring either to the tweets by \r\nwhich we communicate now as opposed to the elegant \r\nhandwriting that they employed in 1945. I am referring \r\nto the theme that we have chosen for this session of \r\nthe General Assembly, and I wonder if it would have \r\nbeen comprehensible to that group in San Francisco. \r\nIt is a different world in which we currently live, and \r\nwe should accept the fact that the Organization must \r\nchange to suit contemporary needs.\r\nTen years ago, as the General Assembly was starting \r\nits proceedings, the world was plunged into a financial \r\ncrisis. The first scenes of that crisis were played out \r\non a street not far from where we are gathered, but \r\nthe consequences were felt, and continue to be felt, \r\naround the world in small countries like Ghana. Some \r\nsay that upheaval lies at the heart of the change in \r\npolitics and outlook throughout the world. Today, as \r\nwe speak, a trade war is being stoked between the two \r\nlargest economies of the world. The consequences \r\nwill affect those who have had no say, including small \r\ncountries like Ghana. Those events provide proof, if \r\nany were needed, that ours is an interdependent world. \r\nWe in Ghana, and people in other parts of the African \r\ncontinent, are determined to pull our countries out of \r\npoverty and into prosperity. We do not believe that a \r\nnation needs to remain poor or become poor for others \r\nto become prosperous. We believe that there is room \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n8/52 18-29871\r\nand that there are enough resources on the planet for us \r\nall to be prosperous. But it does mean that the rules and \r\nregulations that we fashion to guide our dealings with \r\neach other have to be respected by all of us.\r\nFrom the environment to trading rules, we have \r\nto accept that there cannot be a different set of rules \r\nfor different countries. The United Nations provides \r\nthe best vehicle to date for all nations to address their \r\naspirations and challenges. Ghana has always conveyed \r\nits belief in the United Nations and sought to contribute \r\nits share to efforts to make the Organization successful. \r\nWe have embraced the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nand we have integrated the 17 ambitious Goals into \r\nour national vision and budget. We intend for Ghana \r\nto take its turn in July 2019 and present its voluntary \r\nnational review during the High-level Political Forum \r\nof the Economic and Social Council. We will share our \r\nsuccesses and challenges, as well as opportunities for \r\nnew and continuing partnerships.\r\nIt is important to reiterate that advocating for a \r\nworld order in which all countries sign up to obey the \r\nrules does not mean that we insist on uniformity. We \r\ntake pride in what distinguishes us as Africans and as \r\nGhanaians. Fifty-five per cent of the work of the Security \r\nCouncil last year had to do with Africa. Unfortunately, \r\nthat invariably meant peacekeeping and poverty-related \r\nissues. We no longer want to be the place that requires \r\nthe intervention of peacekeepers and poverty-fighting \r\nnon-governmental organizations, no matter how noble \r\ntheir motives. Our regional bodies, like the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States, and our continental \r\nbody, the African Union, are making systematic \r\nefforts, despite significant handicaps, to bring peace \r\nand stability to the entire continent, and, sooner rather \r\nthan later, they will succeed. We know that we must get \r\nour population educated and trained, and we are setting \r\nabout that. We must address our infrastructural deficit.\r\nThe traditional methods for tackling that problem \r\nwill not provide the answer. We are looking for new \r\nways to resolve it. Ghana, like many countries in \r\nAfrica, is forging relations with China, so as to \r\nmake arrangements that can help address part of our \r\ninfrastructure deficit. That is not a uniquely Ghanaian \r\nor African phenomenon. It has not been lost on us that \r\nthe developed, rich and well-established countries \r\nhave been paying regular visits to China and seeking \r\nto open new economic ties and improve upon existing \r\nones. It is also not lost on us that much anxiety is being \r\nexpressed about the possibility of a recolonization of \r\nthe African continent by a new Power. We should learn \r\nfrom history. It was at the turn of the twentieth century \r\nthat China’s first railways were built by Western \r\ncompanies and were financed by Western loans to a \r\nnearly bankrupt Qing Dynasty, and it was under those \r\ncircumstances that a certain strategic port called Hong \r\nKong was leased for 99 years. The rest, as the saying \r\ngoes, is history.\r\nToday the former victim of Western railway \r\nimperialism is lending billions to countries throughout \r\nAfrica, Asia and Europe to build not only railroads, but \r\nalso highways, ports, power plants, other infrastructure \r\nand businesses. The historical echoes are certainly \r\nworrisome, but surely we must, and can, learn from \r\nhistory. We in Ghana must build roads, bridges, \r\nrailways, ports, schools, hospitals, and we must create \r\njobs to keep our young people engaged. It is obvious \r\nto us that the development trajectory on which we \r\nhad been for many decades had not been working. We \r\nare trying a different one, and we would appreciate \r\nthe support and goodwill of the world, especially in \r\nhelping to curtail the huge f low of illicit funds from \r\nour continent.\r\nIt is in everybody’s interests that we, who are \r\ncounted among the poor of the world, make a rapid \r\ntransformation from poverty to prosperity. We are \r\ndetermined in Ghana and, increasingly, in more \r\nand more parts of Africa, to chart our own paths to \r\nprosperity and pay our own way in the world. We are no \r\nlonger interested in being a burden on others. We will \r\nshoulder our own responsibilities and build societies \r\nand nations that will be attractive to our youth. We have \r\nthe necessary sense of enterprise, creativity, innovation \r\nand hard work needed to engineer that transition, hence \r\nour vision of a Ghana and an Africa beyond aid.\r\nIt is equally important that the United Nations be \r\nreformed so as to be able to preside over the changed \r\nand changing world to which we all aspire. The \r\npowerful nations must be willing to adapt to changes to \r\nmake our world a better place. After all, we all inhabit \r\nthe same planet, and we all owe the same duty of care \r\nto ensure its survival. The African common position on \r\nUnited Nations reform, as expressed in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus, remains the most comprehensive proposal \r\nfor the reform of the United Nations, particularly the \r\nSecurity Council. It is time that the global community \r\nendorse it so as to create a modern United Nations fit \r\nfor purpose in our time.\r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 9/52\r\nMay God bless the United Nations and us all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, President \r\nof the Republic of Ghana, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Kersti Kaljulaid, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Estonia.\r\nMrs. Kersti Kaljulaid, President of the Republic \r\nof Estonia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations Her Excellency Mrs. Kersti \r\nKaljulaid, President of the Republic of Estonia, and to \r\ninvite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kaljulaid: Ten days ago I was in Ukraine, \r\npicking up syringes and empty bottles in a park next to \r\na kindergarten in the industrial city of Dnipro. It was \r\non the occasion of the first World Cleanup Day, the \r\nbiggest-ever civil-society action facilitated by digital \r\ntechnologies and the will of millions to volunteer. \r\nFifteen million people in 140 countries, among whom \r\nwere many Presidents and Prime Ministers, took part \r\nand decided to do something for our planet. They were \r\nresponding to the outcry of Estonians who launched \r\nthe voluntary clean-up action 10 years ago. It is very \r\neasy just to talk about a cleaner environment or climate \r\nchange, but if you really want to get things done, then \r\nvery often you simply must get up and do it yourself.\r\nIn many ways, that is also the reason why Estonia \r\nis running for a non-permanent seat at the Security \r\nCouncil for the period 2020-2021, as small countries \r\nhave no time for small objectives. Our aim, among \r\nothers, is to bring all things digital to the Security \r\nCouncil. Cyberrisks are something that Estonians, as \r\ncitizens of a fully digitized State, understand better than \r\nmost. We want to offer our perspective so as to ensure \r\nthat human beings remain safe in this new world where \r\ncyberrelated threats are combined with conventional \r\nones. The vision that we have for our candidacy and \r\nfor the United Nations as a whole is based on three \r\nkeywords: empathy, equality and efficiency.\r\nFirst, with regard to empathy, however sad \r\nthey are, we must talk about our concerns honestly. \r\nAggression should be called aggression, war is war \r\nand occupation remains occupation. Whether we are \r\ntalking about Africa or Europe, I am always deeply \r\ntouched by the misery that war and conflict cause, as I \r\nam when talking with internally displaced women and \r\nchildren in occupied eastern Ukraine or with Georgian \r\npoliticians who are told that, because of the occupation, \r\ntheir country will forever be denied full participation in \r\nworld democratic forums that we, who are luckier than \r\nthey, preciously cherish. Estonia stands in solidarity \r\nwith all those affected by conflict, terrorism and \r\nviolent extremism. We reach out with humanitarian aid \r\nand practical assistance, as well as our peacekeepers, \r\nfrom Africa to the Middle East. We do what we can, yet \r\nit feels as though it is never enough.\r\nOngoing military aggression in eastern Ukraine \r\ncontinues in the very heart of Europe. The Crimean \r\npeninsula remains occupied, as do parts of Georgia, \r\nand there is no resolution to the long-term and violent \r\nconflicts in Africa. It is hard to tolerate those tragic \r\nsituations. Yet mincing words to make ourselves feel \r\nbetter is no solution. For those in distress, recognition of \r\ntheir true situation, together with the humble recognition \r\nthat we cannot do much more than commiserate, is \r\noffering at least some hope — some hope that one \r\nday things could be better; a hope that cannot feed on \r\neuphemisms avoiding straightforward admittance.\r\nIn July, we all reached an agreement on the global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration, and I \r\nam really looking forward to its adoption in Marrakech \r\nin December. But an agreement needs implementation. \r\nWithout implementation, it is hollow — as hollow as \r\nthe days ahead for those not knowing where they should \r\nlay their head for the night or how to calm their crying, \r\nhungry and frightened children. We need to get up and \r\njust go help.\r\nThe same applies to the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change. In order to tackle the global challenge \r\nof climate change that is affecting billions, we must \r\nimplement the commitments we have collectively \r\nundertaken, because the effects of climate change are \r\nincreasingly being felt all over the world, not only in \r\nthe developing countries — especially by small island \r\nStates, where homes, food and even clean drinking \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n10/52 18-29871\r\nwater are greatly at risk and countries are forced to jump \r\nthrough varied and expensive hoops in order to gain \r\naccess to relief funding — but also in the developed \r\nworld, where people have lost their loved ones or homes \r\nin European forest fires or in hurricanes in America \r\nand the Pacific.\r\nYet we are still not dealing with root causes, making \r\nthe world safe for our children by applying the proper \r\nand best available technology standards to all energy \r\nproduction and use, both in the developed and in the \r\ndeveloping world. We should also, very simply, never \r\nforget to switch the light off when leaving the room or \r\nget an air conditioner that stops automatically when we \r\nopen the door — do what we can when we see that we \r\ncannot do it yet at the global level.\r\nWe are all equals in this Hall, not only because we \r\nhave declared so in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nbut also because the challenges we now face are going \r\nto affect each and every one of us. Equality in the face \r\nof global challenges is just the law of nature, which is \r\nmuch stronger than our international law could ever \r\nbe. Yet, international legal space matters, as common \r\nsolutions demand respect of each and every one.\r\nWe see solutions in liberal thinking, but progress \r\nis not possible through polarization, fragmentation or \r\ntribalism. Progress is the force born out of debate and \r\nseeking common solutions. Sovereign equality — the \r\nidea that all sovereign States are equal — is a fundamental \r\ntenet of international law and relations. The role of \r\nthe United Nations is to provide that equality, as a \r\nguarantor of the rules-based global system. We depend \r\non each other, whether we like it or not.\r\nAnd very often it is not the State or international \r\norganizations that get things done, but the grass-roots \r\nactivists and non-governmental organizations that have \r\na vision and a sense of responsibility. A principled \r\nvoluntary approach can shift mountains of inefficiency, \r\nbad governance, neglect and lack of ideas. It can guide \r\nand catalyse policymaking, but not replace it.\r\nRecent women movements like HeForShe have \r\ncome a long way in countering gender-based and \r\nsexual violence. Gender equality is at the very heart \r\nof human rights. With that in mind, Estonia is working \r\nactively in the Commission on the Status of Women. \r\nI have gladly and humbly accepted Secretary-General \r\nGuterres’ invitation to co-chair the High-Level Steering \r\nGroup for Every Woman Every Child for the next two \r\nyears. During my tenure, I intend to raise awareness \r\nof the heroic efforts people are making globally, often \r\nworking without any institutional support. I wish to \r\ndemonstrate how many good ideas there are around \r\nthe world — ideas that have already been found and \r\ntried, but only on a small, scale, and that help someone, \r\nsomewhere, waiting to be discovered and up-scaled in \r\norder to help as many in the world as possible. I hope to \r\nprovide recognition, but also the dissemination of best \r\npractices, which are often the same thing. That is how I \r\ncan personally get something done.\r\nIn terms of efficiency — and that is my third \r\nkey word — nothing is more important than truly \r\neffective multilateralism. Due to its inclusiveness, the \r\nOrganization holds great legitimacy and, due to its high \r\nstandards, it is a moral force. International law should \r\nbe the primary yardstick of national interest. Those not \r\nso powerful, small States, understand that well.\r\nOn Security Council reform, we need to win more \r\nspace for common ground. Peoples and States, both big \r\nand small, should feel that the Security Council acts in \r\ntheir best interests. Too often, the Council falls victim \r\nto its internal differences and clumsy procedures. \r\nHowever, it should not be rendered powerless, especially \r\nwhen mass atrocities are being committed.\r\nWe, together with the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency (ACT) group, have called for Security \r\nCouncil members to feel the responsibility and be held \r\nmore accountable if they block action against breaches \r\nof international humanitarian law. It is telling that 117 \r\nStates have already signed the ACT group’s code of \r\nconduct. Furthermore, we unwaveringly support the \r\nproposal of President Emmanuel Macron of France, \r\ntogether with Mexico, the Netherlands and other States, \r\nthat in the face of great human suffering, the permanent \r\nmembers should voluntarily refrain from the use of \r\ntheir veto.\r\nFurthermore, with respect to efficiency, information \r\nand communications technology can revolutionize \r\nentrepreneurship, education, employment in general, \r\nand even health care. Digital online services provide \r\neconomic growth, bring down unnecessary barriers \r\nbetween citizen and State, as well as between businesses \r\nand sectors, and transcend geographical limits. Estonia \r\nhas shared its knowledge with many nations of the \r\nworld and will continue to do so, in cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the African \r\nUnion and all those interested and willing.\r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 11/52\r\nNew technologies should always be seen as \r\nenablers. They create equal opportunities if supported \r\nby proper policies. The risks related to them should not \r\nbe ignored, also because they do not replace but rather \r\nenhance most of our conventional risks. But well-set \r\ninternational legal space should be able to deliver for \r\nhumankind and avoid Armageddon scenarios.\r\nNo new technology can thrive in a fragmented \r\nworld. Now more than ever, we need global free trade as \r\nan essential element of fostering long-term development \r\nand growth. Estonia, as a small, export-dependent \r\ncountry, is an advocate of free trade, including through \r\ncreating better market access for developing countries \r\nand improving business conditions for investments. \r\nTrade and economy are closely linked with security, as \r\nhistory has so often demonstrated.\r\nWe stand to protect what the developed world has \r\nachieved, what the World Trade Organization stands \r\nfor, and what aspiring regions and bodies have set out \r\nto achieve — for example, freedom of trade and work \r\nin Africa through legal space-setting by the African \r\nUnion. We wish them speedy success, and we stand by \r\nthem to help where we can with our own leapfrogging \r\nexperience in digital technologies.\r\nEmpathy starts at home. If we want to care about \r\nothers, we need to care about ourselves and about the \r\npeople and environment around us. Being connected \r\nand dependent on each other more than ever, we simply \r\ncannot afford to be self-centred and ignorant. We all \r\nneed to see the bigger picture. Empathy can easily \r\nbe translated into efficiency if we really wish to get \r\nthings done. Words are important, but they are not \r\nsufficient if they are not followed by concrete action.\r\nWars and conflicts continue, global warming is \r\nspeeding up and the piles of litter around us just keep \r\ngrowing. We all have equal responsibility to be more \r\nproactive in preventing and meeting the challenges \r\nof our times. When we are feeling helpless, it is \r\nsometimes best to do the little thing we know we are \r\nable to do. Globally, if we all do our bit, things can only \r\nget better. Our globe cannot take any more free-riding; \r\nany more hand-wringing and saying “we cannot”; any \r\nmore inaction; any more hiding behind our current \r\ncomforts — so let us just get up and go get things done.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Estonia for the statement \r\nshe has just made.\r\nMrs. Kersti Kaljulaid, President of the Republic \r\nof Estonia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by General Michel Aoun, President of the \r\nLebanese Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Lebanese Republic.\r\nGeneral Michel Aoun, President of the Lebanese \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency General \r\nMichel Aoun, President of the Lebanese Republic, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Aoun (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to congratulate the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session on her election \r\nand wish her success in her tasks. I also thank His \r\nExcellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák for his efforts during \r\nthe previous session and commend Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres for his efforts, especially his reform \r\nproject at the helm of our international Organization.\r\nThe theme that the President has suggested for \r\nthis session, “Making the United Nations relevant to \r\nall people: global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”, is \r\ncommendable because it demonstrates that the United \r\nNations understands that its present reality requires a \r\nserious improvement in its future role. According to its \r\npurposes and founding principles, the United Nations \r\nmust be the global conscience that preserves balance, \r\nprevents aggression, achieves justice and protects \r\npeace. However, we have seen that on many occasions \r\nthe Security Council has been unable to adopt just \r\nand sometimes decisive resolutions pertaining to \r\ncertain peoples, due to the right of veto. Some States \r\nrefuse to implement resolutions that they deem to be \r\ninappropriate, and do so with impunity, even if those \r\nresolutions are binding and of immediate effect. I will \r\ncite some examples related to the suffering of our region.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978), which \r\ncalled on Israel to immediately withdraw its forces \r\nfrom all Lebanese territories, was implemented only \r\nafter 22 years, and that was due to the resistance of \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n12/52 18-29871\r\nthe Lebanese people. General Assembly resolution \r\n181 (II), of 1947, concerning the partition of Palestine, \r\nwas seen as being of a binding nature although it was \r\nnot, and it was implemented instantly. Meanwhile, \r\nresolution 194 (III), of 1948, which provided for the \r\nreturn of Palestinian refugees to their homeland as soon \r\nas possible, remains unimplemented 70 years after its \r\nadoption. Evidently, the right of veto exists for many \r\nreasons; however, its use has had a negative impact on \r\nmany States and peoples, especially in our region, and \r\ndenied them their legitimate rights.\r\nConsequently, if the United Nations is to be a \r\nglobal leaders that is relevant to all people, it must be \r\nreformed in a way that takes into consideration the \r\nexpansion of the Security Council and an increase \r\nin the number of its members. It must also work in \r\na more transparent, democratic and balanced way. \r\nFurthermore, it is important for the General Assembly \r\nto more closely reflect the actual orientation of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe United Nations is also called on to enhance \r\nhuman rights around the world. Lebanon, which \r\ncontributed significantly to the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights, is committed to the Declaration in \r\nthe preamble of its Constitution. We underscore the \r\nfreedom of the individual in society, and stress that any \r\nviolation of human rights in any country could lead to \r\nconflicts in the future.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to state that Lebanon \r\nis steadily moving forward in promoting human rights \r\nat both the legislative and the executive levels. The \r\nLebanese Parliament has adopted a law establishing a \r\nnational committee on human rights, which includes \r\nthe formation of a committee to investigate allegations \r\nof torture and mistreatment. In that context, we are \r\ncompleting a national action plan for the implementation \r\nof Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), which \r\ncalls on Member States to put in place action plans \r\nto empower women to take part in decision-making, \r\nnegotiation processes and in efforts to address conflicts. \r\nThe Lebanese action plan guarantees the participation \r\nof women in the decision-making process at all levels, \r\nand activates their role in preventing conflicts, while \r\nenacting laws to prevent discrimination against women \r\nand protect them from violence and exploitation.\r\nIn Lebanon, we are trying to mitigate the effects \r\nof consecutive conflicts around us. At the security \r\nlevel, we have managed to improve our security and \r\nstability after having eradicated terrorist groups in the \r\neastern and northern rural areas and dismantled their \r\nsleeper cells.\r\nIn terms of politics, Lebanon held parliamentary \r\nelections in accordance with a law of proportionality \r\nfor the first time. That has led to a fairer representation \r\nof all components of Lebanese society. Today, we are in \r\nthe process of forming a cabinet that is reflective of the \r\nelection results.\r\nIn terms of the economy, we have established \r\nguidelines for an economic recovery plan that takes \r\ninto consideration the outcomes of the Economic \r\nConference for Development through Reforms with \r\nthe Private Sector in order to activate the production \r\nsectors, update the infrastructure and bridge the gap \r\nbetween income and expenditure in our budget.\r\nNevertheless, we are still facing the consequences \r\nof events in Syria. Since the beginning of the war in \r\nthat country, an influx of people have taken refuge in \r\nLebanon in order to avoid the hell of war there. We \r\nare trying to provide a decent life for those displaced \r\npeople. However, their numbers are increasing and they \r\nare affecting local Lebanese communities, as reflected, \r\nin terms of security, in an increase in the crime rate of \r\nmore than 30 per cent; in terms of the economy, in a \r\nrise in unemployment to 21 per cent; and in terms of \r\ndemography, in an increase in the population density \r\nfrom 400 to 600 people per square kilometre. That is \r\ncompounded by our limited resources and a paucity of \r\ninternational assistance for Lebanon, which makes it \r\nimpossible for us to continue to shoulder this burden, \r\nespecially now that most Syrian territory is safe.\r\nThat is why I called for a safe return when I \r\naddressed the Assembly from this very rostrum last \r\nyear (see A/72/PV.11). At that time, I distinguished \r\nbetween a safe return and a voluntary return. Except for \r\na few, the Syrians who have taken refuge in Lebanon \r\nare not political refugees; the majority came to Lebanon \r\nowing to the security situation in their country or for \r\neconomic reasons.\r\nI have with me a map that was issued in 2014 by \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees. It shows an increase in the number of \r\nregistered Syrian displaced persons from 25,000 in 2012 \r\nto more than 1 million in 2014 — just two years — and \r\nshows their distribution on Lebanese territory. The \r\nmap illustrates what I am trying to explain to the \r\nAssembly. In that connection, I note that the United \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 13/52\r\nNations stopped counting displaced Syrians in 2014. \r\nThe Lebanese General Security Directorate, however, \r\nhas continued to keep track of those statistics, which \r\nshow that the number of displaced Syrians in Lebanon \r\nincreased to more than 1.5 million.\r\nI should therefore like to reaffirm my country’s \r\nposition in favour of strengthening the right to a \r\ndignified, safe and sustainable return of displaced \r\nSyrians to their country without delay. Their return \r\nshould not be connected to any political settlement, \r\nas no one knows when that will be reached. We refuse \r\nand reject any nationalization project for the displaced \r\npersons or refugees. In that context, we welcome any \r\ninitiative that seeks to resolve the displacement issue, \r\nsuch as the Russian initiative.\r\nHistory has taught us that injustice leads to war, and \r\nthat the absence of justice and the application of double \r\nstandards fuel resentment, which causes extremism, \r\nviolence and terrorism. Unfortunately, the international \r\npolitical approaches to the Middle East region still lack \r\njustice and apply double standards. The Palestinian \r\nquestion is the best example of that, as the absence \r\nof justice in addressing it has led to many wars in the \r\nMiddle East and inspired a resistance that will end only \r\nonce injustice is eliminated and rights are realized.\r\nThe international community recently voted in the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly against the \r\ndeclaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Despite \r\nthe results of the voting, which reflected the will of the \r\ninternational community, some embassies have been \r\nmoved to Jerusalem. A law on the nature of Israel as a \r\nJewish nation State was also adopted. That unjust law \r\nrejects other people and expressly undermines all peace \r\nefforts and the two-State solution.\r\nFurthermore, a decision was taken to withhold \r\nfinancial assistance to the United Nations Agency for \r\nthe Relief and Work of the Refugees of Palestine in the \r\nNear East (UNRWA), which is mandated with assisting \r\nand protecting Palestinians pending a solution to their \r\nsuffering. Has their suffering ended, thereby triggering \r\nan end to the role played by UNRWA? Is the objective \r\nto strip them of their status as refugees and to integrate \r\nthem into their host countries in order to eliminate the \r\nPalestinian identity and force them to be naturalized?\r\nThe Palestinians are a people who found themselves \r\nwithout an identity or a country overnight, owing to a \r\ndecision taken by those who were supposed to defend \r\nweak countries. Let us imagine for a moment that a \r\nsimilar international decision was taken that stripped us \r\nof our land and identity, and that while we were trying \r\nto hold on to them we were attacked from all sides in an \r\neffort to make us surrender. That is the situation today \r\nof the Palestinian people, who are dispersed throughout \r\nthe world. Would we accept that situation for ourselves \r\nand our people? Would the international conscience \r\naccept that? Is that what is stipulated in international \r\ncharters and conventions? What guarantees that small \r\nnations, such as the Lebanese people, will not face the \r\nsame fate?\r\nFurthermore, Israeli violations of resolution 1701 \r\n(2006), which now exceed 100 a month, continue by \r\nland, sea and air, despite the fact that Lebanon remains \r\nfully committed to its implementation.\r\nOur world today is suffering a crisis of extremism \r\nand fanaticism that manifests itself in the rejection of \r\nothers who are different and of their culture, religion, \r\nethnicity and civilization — in essence, the rejection of \r\ntheir very existence. This crisis is likely to deteriorate. \r\nNo country is safe from this crisis and its destructive \r\neffects on societies and States, because it will implode \r\nthem from within.\r\nThe United Nations — and before it, the League of \r\nNations — has been unable to prevent wars, maintain \r\npeace or achieve justice, especially in our region. \r\nOne of the main reasons for that is because there is \r\nno international culture of peace based on mutual \r\nunderstanding and coexistence. There is therefore an \r\nurgent need for dialogue among religions, cultures \r\nand races. We need international cultural institutions \r\nthat specialize in spreading the culture of dialogue \r\nand peace.\r\nLebanon is a pluralistic society in which Christians \r\nand Muslims live side by side and share governance and \r\nmanagement. We also have a Lebanese diaspora spread \r\nthroughout the world that shares common ground with \r\nmany civilizations and cultures, making Lebanon \r\nan exemplary country in which to establish a human \r\nacademy for encounter and dialogue to disseminate \r\nthose values. Last year, from this rostrum, I launched an \r\ninitiative to turn Lebanon into an international centre \r\nfor dialogue among religions, cultures and races. We \r\nhope that this initiative will materialize and become \r\na multilateral convention to establish such a centre \r\nin Lebanon that would be an international project for \r\nongoing dialogue and harmonious coexistence, in line \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n14/52 18-29871\r\nwith the purposes of the United Nations, including \r\npreventive diplomacy to avoid conflicts.\r\nHumans are the enemy of whatever and whoever \r\nthey do not know. Our salvation lies in dialogue and \r\nin coming together, rejecting violence and achieving \r\njustice. That is the only path that can lead our societies \r\nto stability, security and sustainable development.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Lebanese Republic for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nGeneral Michel Aoun, President of the Lebanese \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Ms. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Croatia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Croatia.\r\nMs. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, President of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations Her Excellency Ms. Kolinda \r\nGrabar-Kitarović, President of the Republic of Croatia, \r\nand to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Grabar-Kitarović: We live in times \r\nof great opportunities and serious challenges. We are \r\nmore interconnected than ever, yet the world remains \r\ndivided in many ways. Technological developments \r\nhave enabled our world to become a truly global village. \r\nOur citizens have become global citizens and are well-\r\ninformed and strongly driven by developments around \r\nthe world. They expect global leadership in these times \r\nof rapid change and great complexity and look to all of \r\nus for inspiration.\r\nWhat is it that people are looking for today? What \r\nis it that they expect of a leader? Mighty words? These \r\ndo not really matter much anymore. Mighty deeds? \r\nYes indeed, but, foremost, what they expect of us are \r\nthe simplest of gestures that bring us together and that \r\nshow our compassion and respect for each other. They \r\nexpect integrity and inspiration.\r\nThis summer, football — of all things — triggered \r\na global response, uniting us for a moment in our \r\ncommon aspirations to excellence. Following the \r\nsuccess of the Croatian national team, I received so many \r\ncongratulatory letters and messages from all corners of \r\nthe world — from China, Australia and Saudi Arabia \r\nto France, Trinidad and Tobago and Nepal. I thank \r\neveryone for their kind words. Vishal Bagale of India \r\nkindly said, “Team Croatia really played well. They \r\nwon our hearts”. Shabbir Allam wrote in Croatian “Svi \r\nkao jedno” — “We are all like one”. Gilberto Castillo \r\nof Colombia pointed out that the final was\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\n“well-deserved for a country that has excelled \r\nin spite of the harsh historic situations it has \r\nexperienced. It is certainly an example to follow”.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nOpshori Nondona, a 14-year-old girl from Dhaka, \r\nBangladesh, was especially persistent in getting her \r\nmessage through. She wrote:\r\n“This year, the whole world has recognized a small \r\nbeautiful country — Croatia — and the power of \r\nfootball. Now the world knows how powerful a \r\nsmall, beautiful nation can be.”\r\nThese messages are but a fraction of many. What \r\nmost of them had in common and what I could read in \r\neach of them is that Croatia — not a large country in \r\nterms of the size of its territory, its population or even \r\nits economic means — has become a metaphor, for all \r\nof these kind people who congratulated us, for what a \r\ncountry can do to inspire others and to reach the top of \r\nthe world, winning the hearts of people worldwide and \r\nrousing enthusiasm that each of their countries can do \r\nthe same.\r\n“The value of a nation is not measured by its size”, \r\nunderlined Bernard Stem of France. Indeed, one does \r\nnot need physical size in order to excel; it takes heart \r\nand persistence. Above all, you need to share a vision \r\nand to work together to make it happen. It is not the \r\nsize of one’s territory that matters; it is the size and \r\nquality of one’s ideas. Magnitude is measured not only \r\nin volume, but even more so in determination to reach \r\nthe goal. Individual Croatian players might have shown \r\ngreat skill and technique on the field, but the reason \r\nthey triumphed was because they played together as \r\na team.\r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 15/52\r\nThe United Nations is a place where we must show \r\nour willingness to act together and play together as \r\na team. Our adversaries are many: poverty; hunger; \r\nterrorism and extremism; instability; lack of education; \r\ngender inequality and the exclusion of women in many \r\nsocieties; environmental hazards; endangered security \r\nand trampled human dignity. We leaders should think of \r\nourselves as a team that needs to work together to take \r\nadvantage of our strengths and address our weaknesses \r\nin order to make our world a better place and inspire \r\nexcellence globally. We should lead not only in \r\nmanaging crises and solving problems, but in spreading \r\nhope and optimism as well. We must demonstrate our \r\nhumanity, solidarity and compassion and in doing so, \r\nwe must above all respect one another. Respect is the \r\nmost valuable asset that we have in interpersonal and \r\ninternational relations.\r\nIt is our responsibility as States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to maintain the relevance, effectiveness \r\nand efficiency of our Organization and to be up to \r\nthe task for whatever challenges may confront us. \r\nHowever, raising awareness of the most pressing issues \r\nis not enough. We must also push for the adoption \r\nof the instruments and frameworks necessary to \r\ndeal with them and, most importantly, secure their \r\nimplementation. Without that, this rostrum will remain \r\na self-serving global stage, just words without deeds.\r\nThrough the years, we have often learned the hard \r\nway that Governments and international organizations \r\nalike have their limits. This has also taught us the value \r\nand importance of inclusiveness and the important \r\nrole that the private sector, academia, civil society and \r\nbrilliant individuals can play in many different fields. \r\nCroatia has many Luka Modrićs, and not only in sports. \r\nOur people excel in so many areas. Marin Soljačić is a \r\nmodern-day Nikola Tesla who is developing a wireless \r\ntransfer of energy, Iva Tolić is conducting breakthrough \r\nwork in molecular cell biology, Ivan Mrvoš is a \r\ndeveloper of smart city furniture for the cities of the \r\nfuture and Mate Rimac is building electric cars, to \r\nname just a few among countless others.\r\nSo let us push against the formal limits of our \r\norganizations. Let us embrace the abundant talent \r\naround us. Let us inspire through science and innovation, \r\nthrough our brilliant individuals at home and our well-\r\nestablished, hard-working diaspora around the world. \r\nLet us inspire through our dedicated and tireless work \r\nat the United Nations. Deeds, not words; inclusion, not \r\nexclusion or isolation; empowerment and motivation \r\nare the keys to success.\r\nWe are the global village, but more often than not \r\nwe tend to miss opportunities to bring the global agenda \r\nto our homes, communities and families. We also \r\nforget to include our homes, communities and families \r\non the global agenda. It takes great tragedies caused \r\nby disasters, global crises, wars or climate change to \r\nremind us of what we all stand to lose. In today’s world, \r\nthat approach, embodied in multilateralism, is under \r\never-increasing strain. This is of particular concern, \r\nsince the most important issues for humankind cannot \r\nbe resolved by any State single-handedly or in isolation. \r\nMultilateralism is indispensable, but I would agree with \r\nthose who call for changes to the multilateral system \r\nthat we should not be complacent. We need to rethink \r\ndecades-old mechanisms and instruments in order to \r\nadapt them to modern times and contemporary needs.\r\nAs we celebrate two very important anniversaries \r\nthis year — the 70 years of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights and the 25 years of the Vienna Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action — it is a fitting time to \r\nremember that respect for human rights, democracy \r\nand the rule of law has always been a precondition \r\nfor long-term stability, peace and development. Nor \r\nshould we forget the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide. We must learn from the tragedies \r\nof Srebrenica and Rwanda — “a shame for the United \r\nNations”, as described by the great Secretary-General \r\nKofi Annan, to whom I pay special tribute today. Those \r\ndark hours must never be forgotten.\r\nThis year Croatia marked its fifth year of \r\nmembership in the European Union (EU). Croatia is \r\na telling example of the transformative force of EU \r\nmembership and the benefits of accession to a space \r\nwhere peace, freedom, human dignity and prosperity \r\nare standards, not mere ideals. For those reasons, \r\namong others, Croatia strongly supports further EU \r\nenlargement to our south-eastern neighbourhood. \r\nResolving all the outstanding legacies of war while \r\nconstructively engaging in regional cooperation and \r\ngood-neighbourly relations is of course essential. \r\nWithin that framework we will maintain a particular \r\nfocus on issues related to the rights of minorities, \r\nmissing persons, war crimes jurisdiction, victims of \r\nwar and domestic processing of war crimes.\r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n16/52 18-29871\r\nGood and mutually beneficial neighbourly relations \r\ndepend to a large degree on the words coming from \r\nacross the border, because it takes only a moment \r\nto deliver inflammatory and revisionist rhetoric in \r\nresponse to domestic political circumstances. However, \r\nrepairing the damage caused takes much, much longer. \r\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, our closest neighbour and \r\na country that is extremely important to Croatia, we see \r\na potential risk of legal uncertainty and political and \r\ninstitutional instability in the wake of the upcoming \r\nOctober elections, owing to a failure to amend the \r\nelectoral framework so that it fully respects the rights \r\nand equality of Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, the three \r\nconstituent peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in line \r\nwith the Constitutional Court’s decision on the legitimate \r\nand proportionate representation of constituent peoples \r\nat all levels of Government, including the presidency. \r\nAnd although it is for the two sides involved to resolve \r\nthe Belgrade-Pristina dialogue, we should be extremely \r\ncautious when it comes to proposals with potential \r\nregional implications, notably on ideas regarding \r\nterritorial exchanges. Otherwise we could reopen a \r\nPandora’s box of potential new territorial claims that \r\nwould provoke serious instability and security threats.\r\nThere are inspiring developments, however, that \r\nhave also demonstrated brave leadership in our own \r\nregion of South-East Europe. We warmly welcome the \r\nsigning of the agreement reached on the name dispute \r\nbetween Skopje and Athens, and we hope that the \r\nreferendum this coming Sunday will represent a crucial \r\nimpetus for the country’s successful continuation of its \r\npath of integration into Europe.\r\nBy adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, along with the historic Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, \r\nwe have sent a powerful message that there is hope for \r\na brighter future. However, if we are to succeed in our \r\nendeavours, we have to mobilize all partners to work \r\ntogether. In that way we can achieve social progress, \r\nprotect the environment, create economic growth and \r\nbuild a more just, stable and peaceful world. Runaway \r\nclimate change is one of the most serious threats \r\nthat we are regularly witnessing — from heatwaves \r\nand forest fires, no longer limited to California or \r\nthe Mediterranean but now also in places such as \r\nScandinavia, to historic typhoons in Japan or the \r\nPhilippines and to the melting of the ice sheets on the \r\nplanet’s poles.\r\nNo country can shield itself from the negative \r\neffects of climate change, and Croatia is no exception. \r\nWith more than 1,000 islands, islets and reefs, and a rich \r\nhistory of Mediterranean heritage, the implementation \r\nof the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment right now is crucial to Croatia’s future. All \r\nover the world, including Croatia, we are seeing rises in \r\nsea temperatures and unprecedented and irreversible \r\nchanges in ecosystems. In Croatia’s beautiful Adriatic \r\nSea, one of the cleanest in the world, we have already \r\nregistered more than 20 new species of tropical fish, \r\nsome of them extremely invasive, that could irreparably \r\nshift its environmental balance. We may soon be \r\nexposed to the danger of rising sea levels, which is \r\nalready an existential issue for many small islands \r\naround the world. It is estimated that the sea level in \r\nthe Adriatic will rise by almost half a metre by the year \r\n2100, submerging parts of world heritage places and \r\ntreasures such as Split, Trogir and Dubrovnik. That is \r\nwhy climate action is not an abstract issue. It is a serious \r\nmatter requiring our constant and undivided attention.\r\nOne of the most important climate-action and \r\nsustainable-development issues for Croatia is reversing \r\nthe demographic trends on our islands, which are turning \r\ninto places where schools have no children and churches \r\nsee more funerals than baptisms and weddings. And \r\nyet the problems that many of these islands are facing \r\nare common all over the world. We need to improve \r\naffordable transportation and connections between the \r\nislands and the mainland. We need to resolve our water-\r\nsupply issues and provide clean water and sanitation. \r\nWe need to invest in education, technology, science and \r\ninnovation so that societies and families can once again \r\nf lourish on the islands.\r\nBlue growth could be a solution. It is a long-term \r\nstrategy to support sustainable growth in the marine \r\nand maritime sectors as a whole. The seas are drivers \r\nof the economy, with great potential for innovation \r\nand growth, and they are set to grow at twice the rate \r\nof the mainstream economy by 2030. That growth \r\nis especially welcome in a number of areas such as \r\nsustainable coastal tourism, new health benefits, \r\nbetter connectivity for islands, sustainable blue growth \r\nand jobs, marine technology, renewable energy, the \r\nmanagement of maritime ecological threats and the \r\npreservation of ecosystems and biodiversity, as well as \r\nimproving safety and security with regard to maritime \r\ntraffic and cross-border maritime pollution.\r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 17/52\r\nOne of the issues that I would particularly like \r\nto emphasize today is marine litter, an increasingly \r\nworrying problem that threatens marine life in all of the \r\nworld’s oceans and affects more than 600 marine species. \r\nCroatia’s coastal areas are being severely affected by \r\npoorly managed waste from our southern Adriatic \r\nneighbours. We have to address the rising problem of \r\nplastic pollution in our seas and oceans urgently if we \r\nwant to leave a liveable world for future generations. \r\nPlastic debris — and each year around 8 million tons \r\nof it ends up in our oceans and seas — is particularly \r\nworrying because it is resistant to environmental \r\nbreakdown. Plastic pollution not only harms sea life, \r\nit also carries toxic pollutants into the food chain, with \r\nus humans at the top. We can start solving this problem \r\nby educating and engaging everyone in a conversation \r\nto rethink plastic, by challenging society’s perception \r\nthat this indestructible substance can be treated \r\nas disposable.\r\nIn that regard, particular attention should be given \r\nto the Ocean Cleanup project, which is designing and \r\ndeveloping the first feasible method to rid the world’s \r\noceans of plastic. Its first mission, to remove 50 per \r\ncent of the so-called great Pacific garbage patch in just \r\nfive years, started several weeks ago. In the media they \r\nare calling it Pac-Man, in a reference to the popular \r\nearly video game. Boyan Slat, the young man behind \r\nthe invention, is a brilliant scientist of Croatian origin, \r\nliving in the Netherlands, and he fully deserves to be \r\ngiven credit here today, beneath the United Nations \r\nlogo, which clearly shows our oceans. My country \r\nis already actively preparing for the fulfilment of its \r\nobligations under the Paris Agreement.\r\nThis year was one of United Nations reforms \r\nin more ways than one — not only through results \r\nachieved in the pivotal sectors of peace and security, \r\ndevelopment and United Nations management, but also \r\nin the transformational nature of our mutual efforts to \r\nmake our Organization fit for the twenty-first century. \r\nThe world has changed profoundly since 1945 and \r\nthe birth of the United Nations. In our reforms, it is \r\nessential that we strike the right balance between the \r\nmaintenance of the basic framework based on the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the f lexibility that \r\nour new realities and contemporary needs demand. \r\nIn pursuing United Nations reforms, we must not lose \r\nsight of the 2030 Agenda. We need a United Nations \r\nthat is capable of coping with constant changes and \r\ngrowing challenges in the international arena, whether \r\nin the field of regional security, conflict management, \r\nthreats to the environment, human rights or front-line \r\ntechnologies that are fundamentally transforming the \r\nareas of labour and disarmament alike.\r\nI want to take this opportunity to commend the \r\nSecretary-General and his team for their tireless efforts \r\nto achieve reform. There is still a lot of work ahead of \r\nus, but we should be pleased with this year’s results and \r\ntrends. If we want to move forward and leave no one \r\nbehind; if we truly strive to make the United Nations \r\nmore relevant and, in doing so, more effective, we must \r\nalso realize that the Organization is and should be much \r\nmore than just New York, Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi or \r\nany other conference location. Multilateralism starts in \r\nour own homes and our own minds. It cannot be an \r\nannual event. It needs to be our daily routine, a way of \r\ndoing business in the world. Everything that we want to \r\nachieve globally and everything that we have agreed to \r\nso far under this dome will be easier to accomplish with \r\nthe understanding and support of our citizens.\r\nIn order to confront all the adversities and \r\nadversaries mentioned in my speech, both as I have \r\ndelivered it and in the more complete, written version \r\nthat has been circulated, we must show our determination \r\nto take on the risk of decision-making. We must be \r\nopen to new ideas and we must show emotion, empathy \r\nand above all enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is contagious. \r\nAs Nelson Mandela — Madiba — whose centenary \r\nwe celebrated two days ago, may have said, “It always \r\nseems impossible until it’s done.”\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Croatia for the statement \r\nshe has just made.\r\nMs. Grabar-Kitarović, President of the Republic \r\nof Croatia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Yemen.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Yemen.\r\nMr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, President \r\nof the Republic of Yemen, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n18/52 18-29871\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Abdrabuh \r\nMansour Hadi Mansour, President of the Republic of \r\nYemen, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mansour (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the Government and the people of the Republic of \r\nYemen, I would like to congratulate Ms. Espinosa \r\nGarcés and the friendly Republic of Ecuador on her \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its current session, and to wish her every success. I \r\nwould also like to thank her predecessor for his notable \r\nefforts at the helm of the previous session. I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his sincere and outstanding work, \r\nespecially his attempts to advance peace in my country, \r\nYemen, as well as his Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin \r\nGriffiths, whose ongoing efforts we support.\r\nThis is the fourth time I have addressed the \r\nAssembly from this rostrum since 2015. We are still \r\nin the grip of a war imposed on our long-established \r\nYemeni people by armed militias who are receiving \r\nfinancial, media, military and logistical support from \r\nIran and Hizbullah. They are extremists. They employ \r\ngangster tactics such as blowing up houses and places \r\nof worship and planting mines with unprecedented \r\nrecklessness. They forcibly recruit children and \r\nextort funds and remittances. They have taken away \r\nour freedoms and rights while wreaking havoc in our \r\ninstitutions. However, as I address the Assembly, the \r\nGovernment of Yemen and all our local authorities \r\nand Government agencies are working hard from our \r\nprovisional capital, Aden, and in our various liberated \r\ngovernorates to restore security and stability, as well as \r\nto provide services and create a democratic, federated \r\ncivilian State where human rights are safeguarded, the \r\ndignity of women and youth is protected and the rights of \r\nchildren and various marginalized sectors of society are \r\nrespected, a State where justice and equality prevail, in \r\naccordance with the outcome of our National Dialogue \r\nConference and as a result of the Gulf Cooperation \r\nCouncil Initiative, its implementation mechanism and \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nIn past statements from this rostrum I have \r\nemphasized that Yemen’s predicament is not a political \r\nconflict that can be contained in a dialogue. I have said \r\nthat it is not even a coup, as those are conventionally \r\ndefined and as happen in other States. It is a series of \r\nattempts to undermine the foundations of coexistence \r\namong Yemenis, to undermine their moderate beliefs \r\nand national principles as established by the two glorious \r\nrevolutions of 26 September and 14 October. We are \r\nfighting a complex religious group that believes as a \r\nmatter of policy in its divine and exclusive right to rule. \r\nIt scorns all the contemporary values of democracy and \r\nhuman rights. Socially, it considers itself a unique race \r\nand demands that people glorify it. It is a group that \r\nhas made use of every form of violence to tear down \r\nsociety and sow hatred among the people. Nationally, it \r\nis a group that has abandoned any loyalty to its nation \r\nand has become a war proxy that is beholden to Iran \r\nand Hizbullah. Any attempt to make peace with it is \r\ntherefore doomed to fail, despite the major concessions \r\nwe have made to establish peace in Yemen.\r\nWith that in mind, I call on the international \r\ncommunity to shoulder its responsibilities by putting \r\npressure on Iran to stop intervening in Yemen and \r\nsupporting the Houthi militias, and to abide by \r\ninternational resolutions and participate in peace \r\nefforts. On multiple occasions from this rostrum I \r\nhave told the Assembly that Iran conducts blatant \r\ninterventions in Yemen. It finances the Houthi militias \r\nand provides them with weapons, missiles, equipment \r\nand experts. It targets international and regional waters \r\nand jeopardizes international shipping routes, and its \r\npolicies enable the f low of drugs to other countries as \r\nwell as drug-trafficking generally. It supports terrorism \r\nthrough the Houthis, Al-Qaida and Da’esh.\r\nThe Yemeni Government has always reached out \r\nfor peace through round after round of consultations \r\nin Vienna, Geneva and Kuwait, and even after our \r\nGovernment delegation’s return from Geneva at the \r\nbeginning of this month. Our high-level delegation was \r\nkeen to seize any opportunity that would alleviate the \r\nsuffering of our people and achieve peace. However, \r\nthe intransigence and brazenness of the insurgent \r\nHouthi militias have disappointed the hopes of the \r\nYemeni people that any possible progress can be made, \r\neven at the humanitarian level. That is typical of this \r\nterrorist group.\r\nI would like to underscore once again from this \r\nrostrum that we are ready for peace. We do not advocate \r\nwar and vengeance but rather peace and harmony. We \r\nare fully aware of our responsibilities to the patient \r\nYemeni people. What we are seeking is sustainable \r\npeace based on national, regional and international \r\nterms of reference. We want to restore our State and \r\nput an end to the coup in every aspect. We uphold the \r\nprinciples that our State must have sovereignty over \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 19/52\r\nall of our national territory and that the State alone \r\nmust possess medium and heavy weapons. That is the \r\nonly way to attain stability in Yemen. Anything else \r\nwill merely mean delaying and then preparing for new \r\nrounds of war and conflict.\r\nWe know that we cannot obtain peace by pleading \r\nwith these gangsters, as some Member States do. Rather, \r\npeace can be achieved by diligently implementing the \r\nrelevant international resolutions, and Member States \r\nshould be serious about implementing them, especially \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2216 (2015), which calls on \r\nthe Houthis to withdraw from cities and institutions and \r\nto hand over their weapons unconditionally. I therefore \r\nwant to call on the Council not to waver in ensuring \r\nthat its resolutions are implemented, as it did to ensure \r\nthe political transition and national dialogue in Yemen, \r\nwhich endured for more than a year.\r\nI want to underline the Yemeni Government’s \r\ncommitment to its efforts to protect civilians, especially \r\nwomen and children. We do not target civilians or their \r\nschools, hospitals or residential areas where there are \r\nrebel strongholds. We have an independent national \r\ncommission of inquiry into human rights violations \r\nthat investigates all allegations of violations of any sort. \r\nEvery military unit of the Yemeni army has also been \r\ninstructed not only to refrain from recruiting children \r\nbut also to protect them, rehabilitate those who have \r\nbeen detained when fighting with the rebels and ensure \r\nthat they return to school.\r\nIt is well known that the war has left our country \r\nfacing economic hardship. The militias have drained \r\nour country’s resources and our internal and external \r\nreserves, which has had an enormous impact on our \r\ncitizens. In an effort to deal with these issues and stop \r\nthe situation from continuing to deteriorate, we have \r\nintroduced a series of measures, most recently last \r\nmonth, when we created an economic commission that \r\nthe Government has authorized to take all necessary \r\nmeasures to halt the devaluation of our currency and \r\ndevelop a comprehensive economic vision that can \r\nhelp us adapt to this unprecedented situation. The \r\nGovernment, the commission and the Central Bank of \r\nYemen have taken numerous remedial measures and \r\nissued a number of immediate instructions aimed at \r\noptimizing the conditions for dealing with our economic \r\ndifficulties. They include permitting the export of \r\noil and gas, stopping foreign currency f light, curbing \r\nimports of luxury goods and raising interest rates. In \r\nthat regard, while Saudi deposits, though not the first \r\nattempts to stop the devaluation of our local currency, \r\nhave helped to mitigate the economic crisis, Yemen is \r\nstill more than ever in dire need of everyone’s support.\r\nDespite Yemen’s limited resources and current \r\ncircumstances, we continue to participate genuinely \r\nand effectively in the fight against terrorism, which \r\nis an unprecedented threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity, as well as development. Within the framework \r\nof our national policy on fighting the scourge of \r\nterrorism, the Government will not cut back its efforts \r\nto take measures to counter terrorism financing \r\nand money laundering, and we are making earnest \r\nefforts to continue implementing our laws in that \r\nregard. My Government has imposed more stringent \r\ncontrols on various suspicious financial transactions \r\nand has strengthened coordination, cooperation and \r\nthe exchange of information with all the relevant \r\ninternational and regional stakeholders. The Yemeni \r\nGovernment will also spare no effort to combat drugs \r\nand the illicit trade in them, whose proceeds are used \r\nto support and finance the terrorist acts committed by \r\nthe Houthi militias, Al-Qaida and Da’esh. I call on all \r\nStates to cooperate and coordinate with us in combating \r\nthe smuggling of artefacts for financing militias and \r\nterrorist groups.\r\nIt is a happy coincidence that today marks the \r\ngreat Yemeni people’s celebration of the fifty-sixth \r\nanniversary of our immortal 26 September revolution, \r\nwhich declared Yemen a democratic republic more than \r\nhalf a century ago. We are proud to be able to retell \r\nthe glories of Yemen and the struggle of its liberal \r\nheroes. We want to stress to our people that the long \r\nhistory of the sacrifices that Yemenis initiated against \r\nunderdevelopment, the rule of the clergy, injustice and \r\ntyranny is complemented today by the sacrifices of the \r\nheroes who are defending our revolution, our Republic \r\nand our country’s unity. In the twenty-first century we \r\ncan never accept the return of the rule of the mullahs \r\nin a new guise, that of the Houthi militias who want \r\nYemen to revert to the dark ages of despotism.\r\nYemen is the origin and source of Arabism. It will \r\ncontinue to stand tall, proud and unified under a just, \r\nfederated regime that corresponds to the ambitions \r\nand expectations of our great people. I am saddened \r\nto see bloodshed anywhere in Yemen, but I feel \r\nresponsible before God and the people for stopping that \r\nbloodshed, inflicted by the war that has been imposed \r\non our people. We will continue to strive positively and \r\npatiently alongside the rest of the world and to make \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n20/52 18-29871\r\nevery sacrifice in our quest to restore peace, security \r\nand stability. It is our duty to alleviate the suffering of \r\nour people throughout our beloved nation, which today \r\nis struggling to implement the outcomes of the National \r\nDialogue Conference, which are supported unanimously \r\nby Yemenis of all Yemeni parties, political and civilian \r\norganizations, including the Houthis themselves, and \r\nhave been drafted as part of the Constitution for our \r\nnew federated Yemen.\r\nIn that regard, on behalf of the Yemeni people I \r\nwould like to thank the King, the Government and \r\nthe people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It has \r\nplayed a leading role in alleviating the humanitarian \r\nsuffering in Yemen through its continued support \r\nand its humanitarian relief and reconstruction efforts, \r\nespecially the Saudi reconstruction and development \r\nprogramme in Yemen, an outstanding project aimed \r\nat bringing development to our troubled areas. Those \r\nefforts are starting to have positive effects for both \r\nthe economy and for Yemeni citizens throughout the \r\nliberated territories. I would also like to sincerely thank \r\nthe humanitarian organizations of the Arab coalition \r\ncountries, as well as our sisterly and friendly donor \r\ncountries, in addition to the various United Nations \r\nbodies, for their exceptional humanitarian efforts. I \r\nalso want to take this opportunity to renew my call to \r\nall donors to honour the pledges they have made to the \r\nhumanitarian response plan in Yemen with a view to \r\nfurther alleviating my people’s suffering.\r\nThe suffering of the Palestinian people is \r\ngrowing daily, owing to Israel’s occupation policies \r\nin the Palestinian territories. That is the main cause \r\nof tension in the Middle East. The Palestinian people \r\nhave long awaited a just solution that will guarantee the \r\ncreation of their independent State and an end to their \r\nsuffering. In that regard, we call on the international \r\ncommunity to continue supporting the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East, in order to enable it to continue assisting \r\nPalestinian refugees.\r\nMy hope is to see the work of the General \r\nAssembly at this session succeed. I hope that by the \r\nnext session, peace will have prevailed in Yemen and in \r\nthe whole world.\r\nMr. Gata Mavita Wa Lufuta (Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to salute from this \r\nrostrum all our great Yemeni people, who are struggling \r\neverywhere to create a new, federated Yemen, a \r\nYemen of justice, equality and good governance. I \r\ncongratulate all of them, everywhere, on the occasion \r\nof the fifty-sixth anniversary of the glorious revolution \r\nof 26 September and the fifty-fifth anniversary of the \r\nimmortal revolution of 14 October. I also want to say to \r\nall honourable, liberal, striving Yemenis that upholding \r\nthe objectives of the September and October revolutions \r\nrequires the implementation of the outcomes of the \r\nNational Dialogue Conference and the creation of a \r\nnew federated Yemen with all of its six regions. May \r\nthe liberal martyrs of Yemen rest in peace. I also wish \r\na speedy recovery to the Yemeni wounded and freedom \r\nto the abductees.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Yemen for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, President \r\nof the Republic of Yemen, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the \r\nEastern Republic of Uruguay\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Eastern Republic of Uruguay.\r\nMr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the Eastern \r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Tabaré \r\nVázquez, President of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vázquez (spoke in Spanish): I bring \r\ngreetings from the people of the Eastern Republic \r\nof Uruguay, a country in the Southern cone of the \r\nAmericas that is small but nonetheless has strong \r\ndemocratic institutions, social and economic stability \r\nand clearly defined values and principles, and that is \r\nmaking tangible progress in all areas. Of course, it \r\nis not and never will be perfect — do such countries \r\nexist? — but it works humbly day after day to make \r\nprogress while leaving none of its inhabitants behind. \r\nThat is the meaning of development, a multidimensional \r\nand dynamic process aimed at achieving the well-being \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 21/52\r\nand prosperity of all citizens. In the World Economic \r\nForum’s Inclusive Development Index 2018, published \r\nin January, Uruguay is ranked as one of the 10 most \r\ninclusive emerging countries in the world and second \r\nin Latin America, owing to efficient public policies \r\nthat enable us to use economic growth to reduce \r\ninequalities and promote social inclusion and equity \r\namong generations.\r\nDespite that, we admit that we still have a lot to do. \r\nIn that regard, there is a specific issue affecting several \r\ncountries, including our own, that I would like to briefly \r\ndiscuss. In our view, the criteria and methodology \r\nthat the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment applies to assess countries’ development \r\naccording to their per capita income represents a grave \r\ninjustice. As a result, Uruguay, like other countries in \r\nthe region, has been considered a high-income country \r\nsince 2013, and starting this year, no longer qualifies \r\nfor official development assistance. The recognition of \r\nour progress is encouraging, but we do not agree with \r\nthe new classification for a fundamental reason, which \r\nis that while growth and development are linked, they \r\nare clearly not the same thing. Uruguay has enjoyed \r\nsignificant economic growth over the past 15 years that \r\nhas enabled thousands of its citizens to emerge from \r\npoverty. But structural gaps persist.\r\nDevelopment in transition is not an arbitrary \r\nconcept. It is the most accurate description of the \r\nsituation of countries that, like Uruguay, are on a path to \r\ndevelopment but still need the support of reconsidered \r\nand reoriented cooperation. There is no question that \r\nwe have made progress, but the road ahead will still \r\nbe difficult. Paradoxically, it seems that no good deed \r\ngoes unpunished, and we hope that this criterion will be \r\nreviewed soon. In addition, we are also of the view that \r\nin the life of countries not everything is about economic \r\ndevelopment and the distribution of resources. We \r\nin Uruguay know that and have advocated nationally \r\nand internationally for an agenda oriented towards the \r\nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\napproved by the Assembly in the framework of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. Such an agenda \r\nshould put special emphasis on the transformation of \r\nthe energy matrix towards renewable sources and \r\nadaptation to verifiable climate change; on making \r\nprogress in the irrefutible responsibility to protect our \r\nenvironment; and, as members are aware, on the fight \r\nfor the health of our people, which is the struggle for \r\nlife, the main human right that all the beings on this \r\nplanet have.\r\nAs a result, we have implemented strict policies for \r\nthe control of tobacco consumption and the prevention \r\nof non-communicable diseases, one of humankind’s \r\nworst aff lictions, in addition to active participation \r\nat the international level. That includes co-chairing \r\nthe World Health Organization Independent High-\r\nlevel Commission on Noncommunicable Diseases and \r\nhosting the Global Conference on Non-Communicable \r\nDiseases in October 2017, where the Montevideo Road \r\nMap 2018-2030 was approved, wherein we reaffirmed \r\nthe commitment to undertake bold actions to reduce \r\nby one third the number of premature deaths from \r\nsuch diseases. There is much left for us to do. There \r\nis also much to be done to combat the mortal agent \r\nthat is tobacco, which kills more than 7 million of \r\nthe planet’s inhabitants per year, much more than the \r\nnumber killed by the two world wars of the twentieth \r\ncentury. That is why we invite every country to apply \r\nthe measures established in Montevideo by the World \r\nHealth Organization.\r\nThose and other elements — such as the universal \r\ndigital agenda, for which we we have developed our \r\nCeibal and Ibirapitá plans, which we do not have the \r\ntime to go into further detail about here — give an \r\naccount of a small, modest and self-confident country \r\nmoving in a concrete direction. That direction could \r\nbe described simply as improving the quality of life of \r\nall the country’s inhabitants without discrimination of \r\nany kind.\r\nUruguay also belongs to the region and the world. \r\nIn that vein, we reaffirm our historic commitment to \r\na more participatory, fairer, balanced and multipolar \r\ninternational system that translates into the basic \r\nprinciples of our foreign policy that has existed \r\nfor decades. That includes, for example, first, the \r\ncommitment to the maintenance of peace, international \r\ndisarmament and security, as well as the participation of \r\nour armed forces in peacekeeping operations; second, \r\nour country’s firm rejection of terrorism, organized \r\ncrime and all types of violence and discrimination, \r\nwhich unfortunately are rampant in the world; third, \r\nsupport for the peaceful settlement of disputes and \r\nfor the sovereign equality of States regardless of their \r\ngeographical size and number of inhabitants; fourth, \r\nunimpeded dedication to, and respect for, international \r\nlaw, which is the greatest guarantee for the sovereignty \r\nof peoples and their peaceful coexistence; fifth, our \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n22/52 18-29871\r\nunwavering commitment to the promotion and the \r\nprotection of all human rights; sixth, adherence to \r\nrelevant notions such as non-intervention in the internal \r\naffairs of other States, respect for sovereignty and \r\nthe self-determination of peoples; and, seventh, the \r\npromotion of multilateralism in all its facets, political, \r\neconomic, cultural, et cetera, as the best way to face the \r\nglobal challenges facing humankind.\r\nIn a turbulent international context where the world \r\nresembles an asylum run by its own patients, we assert \r\nmore than ever the values and principles I just mentioned. \r\nIn that context, we call for a joint, committed effort to \r\nstrengthen and modernize the international system and \r\nthe United Nations. Those are not just words. In practice \r\nwe worked intensely as non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council during the 2016-2017 biennium, and \r\nnow we are doing the same in the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. We put forward our country’s candidature as \r\na member of the Human Rights Council for the period \r\n2019-2021. Uruguay is committed to pacifist ideals, \r\nsolidarity and global peace and security.\r\nFrom this place, where we can speak about any \r\nnumber of issues of interest to humankind, I wish to \r\nconclude my intervention by mentioning one that, \r\nhumbly, we consider it a priority to address before \r\neveryone here. I am speaking of environmental \r\ndegradation and the consequences of climate change. \r\nThe crisis that we are experiencing at the global level \r\nmust be handled decisively by the leaders of each of \r\nthe nations represented here. This is everyone’s fight. \r\nIt is the struggle for life. We ask the powerful world \r\nleaders to respect international agreements to protect \r\nthe environment and to try to avoid ills that are suffered \r\nessentially by the world’s poorest people. We have to \r\ntake active measures to protect all people in our world, \r\nespecially the poorest, who suffer the most. The world \r\nis also suffering, just as a living being suffers, from \r\nvarious risk factors that destroy it little by little, day after \r\nday. This world is our only home for now and for future \r\ngenerations. This world suffers from wars, from the \r\nunbridled desire for indiscriminate profit by industries \r\nthat kill humankind, as the tobacco industry does, \r\nwhich have no regard for the environment, pollution or \r\nthe consequences of the savage consumerism that we \r\nare experiencing.\r\nJust as our behaviour directly affects our health, \r\nand it is the duty of the States to fight for the lives of \r\ntheir inhabitants, it is the duty of all of us who inhabit \r\nthis planet to fight for the place in which we live and \r\nthat we will have to leave for those who will follow \r\nus in this life. That is the case of the December 2015 \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change, concluded \r\nwithin the framework of the 1994 United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. As it is \r\nthe best possible hope for global survival and security, \r\nas well as a commitment that is essential to achieving \r\nthe 2030 Agenda, we reaffim our commitment to that \r\nAgreement. We once again urge the powerful leaders of \r\nthe countries of the world to respect and comply with \r\nthose Agreements. Agreements are signed in order to be \r\ncarried out — and this one especially must be complied \r\nwith. We also join the call to all those States that have \r\nnot yet ratified it to do so as soon as possible. On that \r\nissue, as in so many other areas of life, we need not \r\nrush; however, we must not be late either. Humankind \r\ndoes not have much time to consider those agreements, \r\nwhich are necessary to protect the environment.\r\nIn conclusion, we are convinced that the United \r\nNations system is humankind’s best possible \r\nopportunity to approach confidently and optimistically \r\nthe problems that the present and the future pose, and \r\nto act accordingly. We are all necessary to this shared \r\ntask. Member States can count on us, and we know that \r\nwe can count on all Member States.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Eastern Republic of Uruguay for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the Eastern \r\nRepublic of Uruguay Republic, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Iván Duque Márquez, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Iván Duque Márquez, President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia.\r\nMr. Iván Duque Márquez, President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Iván Duque \r\nMárquez, President of the Republic of Colombia, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 23/52\r\nPresident Duque Márquez (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave the immense honour of addressing this historical \r\nand important General Assembly for the first time \r\nas the President of Colombia. I arrive both proud at \r\nhaving been elected with the highest number of votes \r\nin our electoral history and at being a member of a new \r\ngeneration of Colombians who are motivated to unite \r\nour country around common objectives.\r\nColombia is a magical country, where many races, \r\nregions, customs and ecosystems coexist. It is a nation \r\nwhere culture, ancestral heritage, nature and the \r\nindustrious and helpful spirit of our citizens define the \r\nresilient vastness of a society that does not bend to any \r\nadversity. Our patriotic, industrious and tireless work \r\nforce has made Colombia a people that has earned the \r\nrespect of the world and attracted interest in investment, \r\nand one that is charting a path towards progress, with \r\ndemocratic institutions.\r\nWe have been able to maintain economic growth \r\namid complex regional volatilities. We have seen \r\ncities transform, a boost in production sectors and an \r\nexpansion of the middle class while we adapted to the \r\nchallenges of globalization. We have made progress \r\nin gender equality and in the worlds of work and \r\neducation. In recognition of that progress, I named the \r\nfirst Cabinet with gender parity in the history of my \r\ncountry. But there is much to be done on that front, and \r\nwe will continue to move forward. In proudly telling of \r\nthat history, I commit myself as a Colombian and I am \r\neven more so as we move towards 2019, when we will \r\ncelebrate the bicentennial of our independence.\r\nWe must be more motivated today than ever to \r\nachieve social justice, reject hatred, polarization \r\nand revenge and concentrate on achieving a pact for \r\nColombia — a pact for equity. That is the invitation \r\nwe are sending: that we build a development plan and \r\nagenda to define State policies in the coming decades, \r\nusing the achievement of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals by 2030 as a reference, within a framework of \r\nlegality and entrepreneurship that bring us to the \r\ndesired and necessary equity. I want that proposed \r\nagreement to be based in legality. Peace is an objective \r\nof all Colombians and all of us, absolutely everyone, \r\nwill work decisively for it. However, peace needs to be \r\nbuilt with the rule of law, which combines the public \r\ngoods of security and justice.\r\nOur Government is going to work so that the process \r\nof demobilization, disarmament and reintegration \r\nput forward in the past few years will go forward \r\nsuccessfully. We will offer those who have genuinely \r\nopted to rejoin the law and to be subject to the principles \r\nof truth, justice, reparation and non-repetition the right \r\nopportunities for progress and protection. I appreciate \r\nthe support of the United Nations for its commitment \r\nto contributing to the success of that process. For \r\nthat reason, we have asked it to continue with those \r\ntasks. We will work in the same way to ensure that the \r\nresources and investments that give rise to hope reach \r\nall regions of the country, primarily those that have \r\nbeen hit by violence. The United Nations Mission in \r\nColombia as well as our supervisory bodies know that \r\nour Government has gone through a fragile process on \r\nseveral fronts. The first is budgetary fragility: many \r\ncommitments were made without allocating sufficient \r\nresources. The second is institutional fragility: a \r\ndispersed and complex architecture was created that \r\nhas so far been unable to effectively make progress in \r\nthe achievement of all the goals.\r\nHowever, I want to reiterate to the Assembly that \r\nColombia’s goal is to comply with our obligations to \r\nthose who have genuinely left the path of violence \r\nbehind. We hope to be able to count on the financial \r\nsupport of the entire international community to give \r\nthe process the necessary strength. But just as we \r\nwould comply with our obligations to those who abide \r\nby the rules, it is also our duty to apply the law in an \r\nexemplary manner when it comes to those who persist \r\non the path of criminality. We will not accept a repeat of \r\nthe violence. Those who continue in the world of crime \r\nand who seek to mock the victims and the generosity of \r\nthe Colombian people will feel the full force of justice.\r\nIf we want peace to reign in Colombia, we must \r\ndefeat drug trafficking. With regard to illicit crops, \r\nwe became aware of an alarming situation a few \r\nweeks ago. The growing trend of the past five years \r\ncannot continue, since such seeds have fuelled and \r\nbecome the reason for the emergence of dangerous \r\norganized armed groups. That is why we are committed \r\nto dismantling those transnational criminal networks \r\nthrough a comprehensive approach.\r\nDrug trafficking is a global threat. It is true that \r\nwe must do more in terms of prevention and care for \r\naddicts from a public health perspective. That is an \r\nindisputable truth. However, it is no less true that \r\ndrug trafficking in Colombia is a predator of the \r\nenvironment, a destroyer of institutions and, above all, \r\na corrupter of society. It is our moral duty to combat \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n24/52 18-29871\r\nthat phenomenon, while at the same time promoting a \r\nsociety that rejects drugs because of their devastating \r\neffects on health and society.\r\nWe are already taking steps. We welcome the fact \r\nthat two days ago we supported the Global Call to Action \r\non the World Drug Problem, acknowledging that it is \r\nthe task of all and requires that all countries, including \r\nthose where consumption is increasing as well as those \r\nthat produce chemical precursors, contribute. Under the \r\nleadership of the United States, 130 nations committed \r\nthemselves to continuing that fight. We will not give \r\nup or accept as fate the addiction that is destroying the \r\nsouls of so many young people.\r\nLegality also means overcoming corruption. \r\nCorruption is a threat to democracy, social values \r\nand institutions and must be tackled with full resolve. \r\nFrom the first day of our Government, we presented \r\nmeasures to Congress, and then, in response to the \r\npopular clamour, we launched an ambitious and \r\nessential agenda together with all the parties. We \r\nshowed the world that we are capable of uniting around \r\nnational goals. I call on the international community \r\nto strengthen all sanctions tools and mechanisms to \r\ncombat transnational corruption. Defeating corruption \r\nis a task that involves us all. We must do our utmost to \r\nexpose those who are corrupt and to expedite their legal \r\nand social punishment.\r\nOur commitment to development, our pact for \r\nColombia, also seeks to promote entrepreneurship \r\nand economic recovery. The Sustainable Development \r\nGoals support our agenda for a Colombia where science \r\nand technology are driven by connectivity, access to \r\ncapital, the development of the innovative economy and \r\nthe promotion of research — a Colombia committed to \r\nprotecting biodiversity, promoting renewable energy, \r\nreducing the individual carbon footprint and establishing \r\na citizenship strengthened by steadfast ethics.\r\nThe world should know that that is the Colombia \r\nthat we want to build every day. We will work to \r\nachieve that Colombia. That is our challenge and our \r\nmotivation. For that reason, I must tell the world that \r\nthose goals face a huge challenge.\r\nThat threat or challenge that our country is \r\nexperiencing today is the thousands of fearful faces of \r\nthose who are cold to the bone, with hunger in their \r\nstomachs and grief for their homeland. It is the challenge \r\nof people who, at this very moment, are walking in \r\nthe open and into the unknown on Colombia’s roads. \r\nThey are our Venezuelan brothers who are f leeing \r\na dictatorship. Many of them are innocent children, \r\nunprotected and exposed to the tragedy of exile. While, \r\nover a period of six years, the conflict in Syria has led \r\nto an influx of 600,000 migrants a year to Turkey alone, \r\nin less than two years Colombia has opened its doors to \r\nalmost 1 million of our Venezuelan brothers. We have \r\nreceived them with affection, and we will always do \r\nso despite any social or financial obstacles, because \r\nbrotherhood unites us.\r\nHowever, we must call a spade a spade. We are \r\nexperiencing the most egregious migration crisis in \r\nthe region’s recent history on account of a dictatorship \r\nthat denied freedoms. Today I would like to make it \r\nclear that the self-determination of peoples cannot be \r\nmanipulated at the free will of the oppressors. The \r\nworld must act and unite so that that tragic f light comes \r\nto an end and a people can see hope f lourish.\r\nThat is a global challenge. The end of the \r\ndictatorship and the return to democracy and full \r\nfreedom are the only viable way. That is why the \r\ninternational community must immediately demand the \r\nrelease of political prisoners, quickly identify the best \r\nsolutions to the crisis and prevent such desolation and \r\ndespair from continuing to increase.\r\nI ask that the United Nations hear our request. We \r\nare pleased that it listened to Colombia’s request and \r\nthat the Secretary-General appointed Eduardo Stein as \r\nJoint Special Representative for Venezuelan refugees \r\nand migrants, thereby elevatingthis debate. I also \r\nthank all the countries that joined us yesterday at the \r\nhigh-level meeting convened by Colombia, where the \r\nregional commitment to addressing that humanitarian \r\ncrisis was clear. Such measures must be accompanied \r\nby the establishment of a multilateral fund to care \r\nfor the migrant population, which is a victim of that \r\ndictatorship. That is why we must promote the proposal \r\nannounced by the Inter-American Development Bank \r\nand its President, Mr. Luis Alberto Moreno. However, it \r\nis equally important that all international mechanisms \r\nbe implemented in order to ensure that those who caused \r\nthat terrible tragedy are reported to, and investigated \r\nand punished by, the International Criminal Court.\r\nIt is an honour for me to address the Assembly, to \r\nset out the vision that we have for Colombia, to call \r\nfor global solidarity before the Venezuelan people and \r\nto issue them an invitation. Today more than ever, \r\nthe world needs cooperation and multilateralism. It \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 25/52\r\nis time to come together and not to isolate ourselves. \r\nIt is time to make trade and cooperation the path of \r\nshared opportunities.\r\nWe must continue to move forward in a world \r\nwhere partnerships make it possible to mitigate the \r\neffects of climate change, strengthen fair trade, tackle \r\ncorruption and transnational crime, create employment \r\nopportunities, put an end to discrimination and promote \r\nthe idea of producing while conserving and conserving \r\nwhile producing.\r\nThe Colombia based on legality, entrepreneurship \r\nand equality that we wish to build is already under way. \r\nMoreover, we will not allow anything to snatch from \r\nus the hope of being a country that thinks big and that \r\ndreams of a better tomorrow and of working for the \r\ncommunity of nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Colombia for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Iván Duque Márquez, President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Tupou VI, King of \r\nthe Kingdom of Tonga\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Majesty the \r\nKing of the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nHis Majesty King Tupou VI, King of the Kingdom of \r\nTonga, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Majesty King Tupou VI, King of \r\nthe Kingdom of Tonga, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nKing Tupou: I congratulate Her Excellency \r\nMs. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her assumption \r\nof her presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session. I assure her that the Tonga delegation will \r\nfully support her able leadership. I express our gratitude \r\nto her predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, \r\nfor his successful and able leadership of the Assembly at \r\nits seventy-second session, in particular for making the \r\nwork of the Assembly people-centred and striving for \r\npeace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet. \r\nI also commend His Excellency Mr. António Guterres \r\nfor his ongoing stewardship of the Secretariat. Tonga \r\nfully supports the ongoing work he is undertaking \r\non reform, including the all-important review of the \r\nUnited Nations multi-country offices in the Pacific \r\nIslands region.\r\nMy delegation and I also wish to congratulate the \r\nPresident also on the chosen theme, which is both timely \r\nand relevant. “Making the United Nations relevant to \r\nall people: global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies” aptly \r\nreflects who we are as a collective in ensuring the work \r\nof the United Nations has meaning to those that matter \r\nmost — our peoples. We welcome this theme as the \r\nguiding principle for our work during this session.\r\nIn contributing towards the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nits Sustainable Development Goals, including the \r\ninternationally agreed blueprint for the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of small island developing States (SIDS), \r\nthe Samoa Pathway, Tonga has made both agreements \r\nan integral part of its national planning processes. \r\nThe Government’s priority agenda from 2018 to 2021 \r\naligns with 13 of the 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, namely, Goals, 1 through 4, 6 through 9 and 13 \r\nthrough 17.\r\nThe High-level Political Forum on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment remains an important means, which \r\nTonga endorses for the follow-up, monitoring and \r\naccountability of commitment by Member States \r\nthrough voluntary national reviews, which are linked to \r\nthe 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. \r\nTonga looks forward to presenting its first voluntary \r\nnational report to the High-level Political Forum \r\nin 2019.\r\nThe High-level Political Forum will also dedicate \r\na day at its high-level ministerial segment to the \r\nmid-term review of the Samoa Pathway in 2019. Tonga \r\nwas pleased to host the Pacific regional preparatory \r\nmeeting for the mid-term review of the Samoa Pathway \r\nin June, the outcome report of which forms the latest \r\niteration of the Pacific region’s sustainable development \r\naspirations. Tonga looks forward to engaging with other \r\nSIDS and partners in Samoa at the end of next month to \r\nproduce the final interregional report for the midterm \r\nreview of the Samoa Pathway for consideration at the \r\nHigh-level Political Forum next year.\r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n26/52 18-29871\r\nIn that regard, we recognize the important \r\ncontribution of the United Nations Office of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, the United Nations Department of \r\nEconomic and Social Affairs and the United Nations \r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the \r\nPacific Subregional Office for the Pacific.\r\nTonga welcomes the convening of the third high-\r\nlevel meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention \r\nand control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) \r\ntomorrow. Combating the threat that NCDs poses \r\nto individuals, families and communities has been \r\nrecognized as grossly underfunded given its magnitude.\r\nWe in Tonga are pleased to inform the Assembly of \r\ncommendable reductions in the prevalence of tobacco \r\nsmoking and alcohol consumption. Tongan people are \r\neating healthier food and involved more in physical \r\nactivities. We are, however, not without challenges, \r\nfor example, as shown in rising obesity rates. The \r\nTongan Government is addressing the issue by making \r\nunhealthy food choices more expensive and healthier \r\nfood choices cheaper for the Tongan public.\r\nClimate change continues to pose significant \r\nsecurity threats to us as island States. In Nauru earlier \r\nthis month, Pacific leaders endorsed an expanded \r\nconcept of security in their communiqué and the Boe \r\nDeclaration, linking, inter alia, climate change and \r\nthreats to international peace and security. In that \r\nregard, Tonga welcomes the establishment of the Group \r\nof Friends on Climate and Security to further highlight \r\nthe nexus between the threats of climate change with \r\nthreats to international peace and security.\r\nWe note with concern the devastating impacts of \r\nclimate change on our marine environment. Baselines \r\nthat determine our territorial boundaries, once \r\nestablished under the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea, should not be affected and should \r\nremain unchanged, despite the effects of sea-level rise. \r\nOur sovereignty must not be compromised by climate \r\nchange. We welcome the work of the International Law \r\nCommission on this critically important and timely \r\nissue for consideration by the Sixth Committee.\r\nTonga looks forward to taking our important work \r\nforward at the twenty-fourth session of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nunder the leadership of Poland in December. We seek \r\nto strongly address the adverse impacts of climate \r\nchange and the urgent need for innovation in adaptation \r\nfor SIDS.\r\nTonga engaged in this year’s first intergovernmental \r\nconference on the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nbiological diversity in the high seas and the seabed. We \r\nare hopeful that a gradual convergence of views will \r\nresult in a zero-draft of a legally binding instrument for \r\nconsideration at the second and third meetings of the \r\nintergovernmental conference, to be held in March and \r\nAugust 2019, respectively.\r\nTonga has also continued its engagement at \r\nthe International Seabed Authority in ensuring the \r\nappropriate management of the resources of the area. \r\nTonga is grateful to the members of the Authority for \r\nits re-election this year to the Council, and we look \r\nforward to working together on the development of the \r\nimportant draft exploitation regulations. Tonga also \r\nlooks forward to hosting the first regional International \r\nSeabed Authority workshop, in early 2019, to explore \r\nthe benefits of seabed mining to the blue economy of \r\nPacific Islands and to progressing development of a \r\nregional treaty on deep sea mining.\r\nWe would like to acknowledge Italy’s ongoing \r\npartnership with Tonga through the joint committee \r\nin strengthening Tonga’s capacity in the field of the \r\nenvironment and the ocean. We also acknowledge the \r\nwork of the secretariat of the Pacific Community, the \r\nCommonwealth Secretariat and the Pew Charitable \r\nTrust on the regional treaty.\r\nTonga commissioned its first independent power \r\nproducer-owned solar farm last year and strongly \r\nbelieves that it can achieve its 50 per cent renewable \r\nenergy target by 2020 through more and stronger public-\r\nprivate partnership arrangements. Tonga wishes to \r\nacknowledge the partnership it has established with the \r\nGovernment of Austria, the United Nations Industrial \r\nDevelopment Organization and the Pacific Community \r\nto establish the Pacific Centre for Renewable Energy \r\nand Energy Efficiency, a specialized regional entity \r\nto support private-sector investments in renewable \r\nenergy and energy efficiency in the Pacific islands. \r\nWe would also like to recognize and acknowledge the \r\nannouncement made by the Government of Norway of \r\nits commitment to provide $2 million in support of the \r\nimportant work of the Centre.\r\nFinally, sustainable development — whether it \r\nbe, inter alia, through good health and well-being, \r\nclimate action, life below water or affordable and clean \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 27/52\r\nenergy — can be realized only through international \r\npeace and security. We continue to look to the Security \r\nCouncil to protect the innocent from threats to \r\ninternational peace and security in any form, be they \r\ntraditional threats such as armed conflict or newer \r\nthreats such as climate change, to ensure that no one is \r\nleft behind.\r\nMay Almighty God guide and bless the President \r\nof the General Assembly, all the States Members of \r\nthe United Nations and their respective Governments \r\nand peoples.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank His Majesty \r\nthe King of the Kingdom of Tonga for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nHis Majesty King Tupou VI, King of the Kingdom \r\nof Tonga, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ibrahim Keita, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mali\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Mali.\r\nMr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mali, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim \r\nBoubacar Keita, President of the Republic of Mali, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Keita (spoke in French): At the outset, I \r\nwish to convey the most cordial greetings of the Malian \r\npeople, from Kayes to Kidal and from Sikasso to \r\nTaoudenni, passing through Konna in the Mopti region. \r\nI would like to extend my warm congratulations to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on \r\nher election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-third session. That is a choice that honours \r\nher and, beyond that, her beautiful country of Ecuador, \r\nwith which Mali has excellent relations in terms of \r\ncooperation. I wish to say to the President that, with \r\nthe help of the United Nations and of the international \r\ncommunity, Mali has today reached a significant \r\nmilestone in its destiny following the successful \r\npresidential elections we recently held.\r\nAs is customary, I should also like to congratulate the \r\nPresident’s predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák of Slovakia, for the outstanding results he \r\nachieved during the seventy-second session. Let me also \r\nexpress my deepest gratitude to the Secretary-General \r\nof our common Organization, Mr. António Guterres, \r\nfor his leadership and many initiatives aimed at further \r\nstrengthening the effectiveness and credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nBefore continuing, I wish to pay shining tribute to \r\nthe memory of the late Kofi Annan, former Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who was taken from us on 18 August. I \r\nremember him as a great African diplomat who worked \r\nthroughout his life to promote international peace, \r\nsecurity and development across the world.\r\nMali welcomes the President’s decision to place \r\nthe current session under the theme “Making the \r\nUnited Nations relevant to all people: global leadership \r\nand shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies”. This theme is certainly of \r\nparamount importance for all States Members of our \r\nOrganization. Its aims and principles remain relevant, \r\nincluding in the areas of preventing and managing the \r\nmany crises that we, the peoples of the United Nations, \r\nface.\r\nFor its part, Mali commends the immense and \r\nmultifaceted contribution of the United Nations to \r\nits ongoing stabilization process. I would like to pay \r\ntribute to the women and men of United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in \r\nMali for their commitment and sacrifice in a complex \r\nand difficult security context.\r\nAs leaders we have a collective responsibility to do \r\nmore and better in order to render our Organization even \r\nmore relevant and effective for all. To do so,  the United \r\nNations requires reforms that will lead to a peaceful, \r\ninclusive, equitable and sustainable international \r\ncommunity. In that regard, Mali welcomes the reforms \r\ninitiated by the Secretary-General in the spheres of \r\ndevelopment, peace and security.\r\nHowever, we need to reinforce those initiatives by \r\nagreeing to also reform some of the principal organs, \r\nincluding the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly, including when it comes to their respective \r\ncompositions and working methods. It is also at the cost \r\nof those essential reforms that we will collectively be \r\nable to fulfil the deepest aspirations of our peoples and \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n28/52 18-29871\r\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, \r\nas stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe year 2018 is devoted to pursuing and \r\nstrengthening the democratic and republican steps \r\ntaken by Mali and its people towards peace, stability \r\nand development to the benefit of all populations of the \r\nSahel region, and indeed beyond. Despite the numerous \r\nchallenges that my country is facing, the presidential \r\nelections were able to take place within the constitutional \r\ntimelines on 29 July and 12 August, in conditions \r\nwelcomed by the entire international community. The \r\ninclusive nature of the organization of the elections, \r\nattested to by the participation of all political and civil \r\nsociety stakeholders, allowed citizens to freely express \r\ntheir choice and to prove the political, democratic and \r\nrepublican maturity of the Malian people.\r\nFor my part, upon the conclusion of the elections, \r\nI took full measure of the confidence that the Malian \r\nnation had just renewed in me. That is why I am \r\ncommitted to restoring trust between the State and its \r\ncitizens to further improve the country’s governance. \r\nMoreover, I will work relentlessly for the diligent and \r\ninclusive implementation of the Agreement for Peace \r\nand Reconciliation in Mali, outcome of the Algiers \r\nprocess, which, I will not cease to repeat, is the only \r\nalternative for my country to reconnect with peace and \r\nstability, a prerequisite for all development. To achieve \r\nthose goals in the context of my country, a sacred \r\nunion of all forces of the nation is required. Likewise, \r\nI reiterate my unwavering commitment to give pride of \r\nplace to dialogue and consultation in the management \r\nof public affairs.\r\nI remain determined to advance the peace process in \r\nMali to ensure that my country emerges from the worst \r\ncrisis in its history. Therefore, under my authority, the \r\nGovernment and other Malian actors, with the support \r\nof our partners, have achieved significant progress \r\nin the implementation of the Agreement for Peace \r\nand Reconciliation. Among these major achievements, \r\nI wish to underscore that there have been no clashes or \r\nconfrontations between the Malian armed forces and \r\narmed movements since the Agreement on Peace and \r\nReconciliation in Mali was signed in May 2015. I also \r\nhappily recall the restoration of Malian authority to \r\nKidal and other areas of the country. The presence of \r\nthe State in these regions, which were hit hard by the \r\ncrisis, has made it possible, among other things, to open \r\nclasses for the benefit of children and contributed to \r\nthe gradual provision of the necessary basic services so \r\nthat the people can enjoy the dividends of peace.\r\nMoreover, I note with satisfaction the establishment \r\nand ongoing operationalization of territorial \r\ncommunities in the Ménaka and Taoudenni regions, \r\nthe establishment of interim authorities in the five \r\nnorthern regions, the launch of the operations of \r\nthe Operational Coordination Mechanism in Kidal, \r\nTimbuktu and Gao, and progress in the processes of \r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration and \r\nsecurity-sector reform.\r\nI am fully aware that these gains are fragile. I am \r\nalso aware that we need to do more and better. This \r\nis the purpose of the road map of 22 March. I have \r\ninstructed the Government to honour its commitments \r\npursuant to these mechanisms. However, I must stress \r\nthat political will alone will not be enough to fulfil \r\nall the commitments undertaken in the Agreement. \r\nAdequate technical and financial support will also be \r\nrequired. I take this opportunity to reiterate my call for \r\nthe effective and rapid mobilization of the resources \r\npledged by our partners with a view to helping us \r\nachieve all commitments contained in the road map by \r\nthe agreed deadlines.\r\nI can also assure the Assembly that the people of \r\nMali are most grateful for the active solidarity of the \r\ninternational community in the form of the presence \r\nand support of the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, the European \r\nforces, the French Operation Barkhane, the Group \r\nof Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel), the African Union, \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States and \r\nneighbouring countries.\r\nIn addition to the devastating effects of climate \r\nchange on the living conditions of our population, the \r\nSahel has for several years faced terrorism, transnational \r\norganized crime and trafficking of all kinds, especially \r\nof drugs, arms, illicit goods and migrants, and money-\r\nlaundering. A war for the anti-Christ, from before the \r\nProphet; a war waged on behalf of darkness, in which \r\ndeath is not an accident, a battlefield casualty or even \r\nor a supreme sacrifice but the ultimate goal — that is \r\nwhat we are dealing with in the Sahel. It is all too easy \r\nto understand the urgency of the universal call to fight \r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nWe established the G-5 Sahel, comprising Burkina \r\nFaso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and the Niger, in \r\nNouakchott in November 2014, to pool our efforts to \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 29/52\r\naddress our region’s security and development issues, \r\nhaving fully grasped the link between the fragility \r\nof States and the precariousness our populations at \r\ntimes experience, and how certain interests may seek \r\nto use it to subversive ends. However, the G-5 Sahel \r\nJoint Force is struggling to become fully operational \r\nas it lacks the appropriate mandate and, in particular, \r\nsufficient funding.\r\nWe believe that the fight against terrorism in the \r\nSahel is an important contribution to global security. \r\nThat is why we continue to ask the Security Council \r\nto authorize the deployment of the Force under \r\nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nwith adequate, sustainable and predictable funding, \r\nincluding through the United Nations, so as to enable it \r\nto carry out his mandate consistently and effectively. In \r\nthe same vein, we invite our bilateral and multilateral \r\npartners, who made pledges of financial contributions \r\nin February at the Brussels Conference, to honour those \r\ncommitments to the G-5 Sahel Joint Force. In parallel \r\nwith the security response, the G-5 Sahel is working \r\nto implement its Priority Investment Programme to \r\naddress development challenges, which are among the \r\nroot causes of instability in our shared region.\r\nAt the national level, I have made the fight against \r\npoverty one of the priorities of my second five-year \r\nterm. During my swearing-in, on 4 September, I \r\npledged before the Malian people to do all in my power \r\nto optimize our system of national solidarity so as to \r\nforge a Mali where no one is left behind. I want to \r\nlaunch a new social model based on equality and social \r\njustice and that will create the conditions for everyone \r\nto succeed. Promoting Malian youth will be at the \r\ncentre of my work over the next five years. I have made \r\nyoung people the great cause of my second term. I will \r\ncommit to a national youth pact through significant \r\ninvestments in renewing our education and training \r\nsystem, and to promote employment.\r\nIn the same vein, I will not only continue but step \r\nup the implementation of major road infrastructure, \r\nagriculture, water, energy and social housing projects. \r\nI remain convinced that implementing these priority \r\nactions will accelerate the attainment of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) at the national level. In \r\nthat regard, Mali is pleased to have presented in July, \r\nhere in New York, its voluntary national report on \r\nSDG implementation.\r\nAs a country of origin and transit as well as a \r\ndestination for migrants, Mali welcomes the conclusion \r\nof negotiations on the global compact for safe, orderly \r\nand regular migration — and, I would add, humane \r\nmigration. This collective decision gives hope to the \r\n250 million migrants throughout the world and, beyond \r\nthem, to all of humankind at a time when migration \r\nhas become a major issue for all States. Mali will, \r\nof course, play an active role at the international \r\nconference to be held in Marrakech in December with \r\na view to the formal adoption of the global compact \r\nfor safe, orderly and regular migration, which now \r\noffers us a comprehensive framework for managing \r\nmigration governance globally. At the same time, Mali \r\nwill continue to shoulder its share of responsibility \r\nin managing migratory f lows, in accordance with its \r\nnational migration policy.\r\nDespite our domestic situation, the people and \r\nGovernment of Mali remain attuned to the situation \r\nin Africa and the rest of the world. In Africa, we \r\nwelcome the normalization of diplomatic relations \r\nbetween Eritrea and Ethiopia, as well as the conclusion \r\nof a peace agreement between our brothers in South \r\nSudan. We also thoroughly commend the successful \r\nholding of legislative elections in our fellow Republic \r\nof Mauritania, and praise the people of that brotherly \r\nand friendly nation for its political maturity and \r\ncommitment to democracy.\r\nHowever, we are deeply concerned at the situation \r\nin Libya, which regrettably continues to negatively \r\nimpact the security and stability of the Sahel region. \r\nIn the light of this situation, which has lasted for too \r\nlong, we call urgently on the international community \r\nto persuade the Libyan parties to prioritize dialogue \r\nand seek a lasting solution to the crisis.\r\nWe are also following with concern the situation in \r\nthe Middle East, especially in the occupied territories. \r\nThe people of Mali reaffirm their  support to the \r\nbrotherly people of Palestine in their  legitimate struggle \r\nfor self-determination. The Government of Mali calls \r\nfor the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations \r\naimed at reaching a two-State solution, with Israel and \r\nPalestine living side by side in peace and within secure \r\nand internationally recognized borders.\r\nIn humanitarian terms, Mali is concerned about \r\nthe precarious situation of the 65 million refugees and \r\ninternally displaced persons worldwide as a result of \r\narmed conflicts, natural disasters and climate change. \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n30/52 18-29871\r\nI am thinking in particular of my compatriots who \r\nare refugees in neighbouring countries, which I thank \r\nfor their hospitality and generosity. I assure those \r\ncompatriots that the Government will spare no effort \r\nin continuing to assist them and to create the conditions \r\nfor them to return home in safety and dignity.\r\nMali has never faltered in its belief in international \r\nsolidarity and cherishes its cooperation with the United \r\nNations, which today provides us with a range of \r\nsupport. Mali, which I have the privilege of leading \r\ntoday, reaffirms its commitment to playing its full part \r\nin building a peaceful, equitable and prosperous world \r\nfor all.\r\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm the profound gratitude of \r\nthe people and theGovernment of Mali to the United \r\nNations and our bilateral and multilateral partners for \r\ntheir unwavering support to the peace process in Mali. \r\nFor my part, I reaffirm my full commitment to sparing \r\nno effort to ensure that the Agreement on Peace and \r\nReconciliation in Mali, emanating from the Algiers \r\nprocess, is implemented diligently and fully.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Mali for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mali, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Angola\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Angola.\r\nMr. João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço, President \r\nof the Republic of Angola, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. João \r\nManuel Gonçalves Lourenço, President of the Republic \r\nof Angola, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Lourenço (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation): The \r\nGeneral Assembly is holding its seventy-third session \r\nat a special moment as we pay tribute to two towering \r\nfigures of world politics, both sons of Africa: Nelson \r\nMandela and Kofi Annan.\r\nToday, exactly one year since my inauguration as \r\nPresident of the Republic of Angola, I have the honour, \r\non behalf of the Angolan people, to address from \r\nthis rostrum for the first time the entire international \r\ncommunity, represented here by its highest dignitaries. \r\nI salute the Heads of State and Government present \r\nhere, as well as the leaders of the various international \r\norganizations and bodies, whom I believe to be working \r\ndirectly for the future of our planet.\r\nI take this opportunity to thank the entire \r\ninternational community for its support for peace \r\nand reconciliation in my country, Angola. I also offer \r\nmy particular gratitude to the United Nations for the \r\ndecisive role it played in establishing lasting peace \r\nin Angola through two peace missions — the United \r\nNations Angola Verification Mission and the United \r\nNations Observer Mission in Angola — and for the \r\nimportant work of its specialized agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes, in particular UNICEF and the World \r\nFood Programme.\r\nWe also believe that Angola’s experience in building \r\npeace and pursuing reconciliation between parties in \r\nconflict has served as a positive example for the United \r\nNations, providing useful insights for approaching \r\npeace processes in other parts of the world. Angola has \r\nunique experience in building and maintaining lasting \r\npeace, continuously deepening national reconciliation, \r\nsocial inclusion and mutual forgiveness, and healing \r\nthe wounds of the armed conflict, which ended almost \r\n16 years ago.\r\nMr. Ten-Pow (Guyana), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe gather in the General Assembly to discuss \r\nand resolve the most serious problems and conflicts \r\nthat threaten the very survival of humankind. I am \r\nreferring to the hunger and poverty that affect millions \r\nof citizens around the world, global warming and its \r\nconsequences, mass migration and especially illegal \r\nmigration, trafficking in drugs, in human organs, and \r\nin children and women for forced prostitution, religious \r\nintolerance and extremism, terrorism, inter-ethnic \r\narmed conflicts, war among nations or even the \r\nuncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons.\r\nEstablished 73 years ago with the declared \r\npurpose of restoring universal peace and harmony, \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 31/52\r\nconferring equal rights on nations large and small, \r\nand establishing a world of cooperation, progress \r\nand well-being, the United Nations is still far from \r\nachieving the goals enshrined in its Charter. While it \r\nis true that, immediately following that establishment, \r\nthe immediate polarization of the planet into two \r\nantagonistic political and economic systems hindered \r\nthe operationalization of principles favouring \r\ninternational peace and security, it would be unfair to \r\ndeny that the United Nations has played a commendable \r\nrole in ending colonialism, promoting human rights, \r\nsupporting international development and cooperation, \r\nand managing and containing f lashpoints of tension \r\naround the world.\r\nDespite the progress made to date, we must \r\nacknowledge the long-standing conflicts yet to be \r\nsettled, such as that between the Israelis and Palestinians \r\nin the Middle East, which can be resolved only through \r\na solution based on two States living peacefully side \r\nby side, as advocated by the United Nations and the \r\noverwhelming majority of its Member States.\r\nWe welcome the recent efforts of the United States \r\nof America, North Korea and South Korea, with the \r\ncontribution of the People’s Republic of China, towards \r\nthe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, which \r\nhas considerably reduced tensions that threatened to \r\ntrigger a nuclear conflict that would endanger not only \r\nthe region but international security in general.\r\nWith the end of the so-called Cold War, symbolized \r\nby the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the momentous \r\nemergence of a new political paradigm oriented towards \r\nmultilateralism, the United Nations eagerly resumed \r\nits work towards building a peaceful world order. We \r\nbelieve that, by working diligently together, we can \r\nachieve this goal.\r\nToday, in a time of ascendant globalization, there \r\nis no justification for the continued proliferation of \r\napparently unresolvable conflicts of varying scale in \r\nseveral parts of the world, or for entire populations to \r\ncontinue suffering their tragic consequences, virtually \r\nabandoned to their fate. It is against this backdrop \r\nthat many voices are demanding profound reform of \r\nthe United Nations so that it can better reflect today’s \r\nworld, where the emergence of new centres of economic \r\nand financial power and technological and scientific \r\nadvances fully justify changes to the Organization’s \r\nstructures and intervention mechanisms, as well as \r\nthe enlargement and reform of the Security Council \r\nto better represent the various geopolitical regions of \r\nour planet.\r\nThe political configuration of today’s world, \r\nin which local, regional and intra-State conflicts \r\nrepresent the principal focus of international tensions \r\nand threats to peace, requires the United Nations to \r\nplay an increasingly active role in promoting and \r\nassisting political, social and economic processes \r\nof democratization. This is the best way to resolve \r\nconflicts, be they domestic, international, ethnic \r\nor religious, which in most cases arise as a result of \r\npolicies of authoritarianism or exclusion, intolerance, \r\nradicalism or interference in the internal affairs of \r\nsovereign States. International terrorism, transnational \r\norganized crime, illegal immigration, xenophobia, \r\ntrafficking in people and in drugs, and other scourges \r\nhave today reached new proportions, affecting the \r\nquality of life of the inhabitants of the planet and \r\ncalling for coordination at the highest level among all \r\nStates Members of our Organization.\r\nThe seventy-third session of the General Assembly is \r\nbeing held under the theme “Making the United Nations \r\nrelevant to all people: global leadership and shared \r\nresponsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties”. The United Nations should therefore attach \r\npriority to promoting and upholding human rights and \r\nstrive to solve humankind’s global problems — such \r\nas those relating to security, the environment, reducing \r\ninequality between the rich and the poor, and \r\ndevelopment — with a view to safeguarding world \r\npeace. We advocate the decentralization of the global \r\nfinancial system, based both on the promotion of trade \r\nand regional economic integration systems, and the \r\nenhancement of regional financial institutions on terms \r\nthat allow for more sustainable economic development.\r\nThroughout our history as an independent country, \r\nour cooperation with the United Nations has always \r\nbeen a constant; it has helped us not only to relaunch \r\nour economy, but also to engage in seeking to build \r\npeace, democracy and development in southern and \r\ncentral Africa. The Republic of Angola stands ready to \r\ncontinue supporting all efforts to promote cooperation \r\namong all nations of the world in building peace and \r\nstrengthening cooperation, trade and investment \r\nrelations at the bilateral and multilateral levels.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Angola for the statement he has just made.\r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n32/52 18-29871\r\nMr. João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço, President \r\nof the Republic of Angola, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, \r\nPresident of the Councils of State and of Ministers \r\nof the Republic of Cuba\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Councils of \r\nState and of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba.\r\nMr. Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, President \r\nof the Councils of State and of Ministers of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Miguel Díaz-Canel \r\nBermúdez, President of the Councils of State and of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Cuba, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bermúdez (spoke in Spanish): It is \r\nimpossible to stand here speaking from this rostrum \r\non behalf of Cuba and not recall historic moments \r\nbefore the General Assembly that are among our most \r\ncherished memories. Fidel Castro, Ernesto Guevara, \r\nRaúl Castro Ruz and the Chancellor of Dignity, Raúl \r\nRoa, to mention only the most illustrious, here raised \r\ntheir voices on behalf not only of our people but also \r\nof other non-aligned peoples of Latin America and \r\nCaribbean, Africa and Asia, together with whom \r\nwe have fought for more than half a century for a \r\nfair international order, that is still far from having \r\nbeen achieved.\r\nThat failure is absurd but consistent with the \r\nirrationality of a world in which the richest 0.7 per cent \r\nof the population can claim 46 per cent of all wealth, \r\nwhile the poorest 70 per cent of the population has \r\naccess to only 2.7 per cent of that wealth, 3.46 billion \r\npeople survive in poverty, 821 million live in hunger, \r\n758 million are illiterate and 844 million lack basic \r\nservices, such as drinking water. All these figures \r\nare, of course, prepared and regularly manipulated \r\nby global organizations, but it seems that they have \r\nfailed to raise sufficient awareness among the so-called \r\ninternational community.\r\nThese facts are not the result of socialism, as \r\nthe President of the United States said in this Hall \r\nyesterday (see A/73/PV.6). They are consequences of \r\ncapitalism, especially imperialism and neoliberalism, \r\nof the egoism and exclusion inherent to that system, and \r\nof an economic, political, social and cultural paradigm \r\nthat concentrates wealth in the hands of a minority as a \r\nsignificant majority pay the price through exploitation \r\nand poverty.\r\nCapitalism financed colonialism; gave rise to \r\nfascism, terrorism and apartheid; and spread war \r\nand conflict, violations of the sovereignty or self-\r\ndetermination of peoples, and the repression of workers, \r\nminorities, refugees and migrants. Capitalism runs \r\ncounter to solidarity and democratic participation. The \r\npatterns of production and consumption characteristic \r\nof capitalism promote plundering and militarism, \r\nthreaten peace, lead to violations of human rights; and \r\npose the greatest danger to the ecological balance of the \r\nplanet and the survival of the human race.\r\nNo one should mistakenly believe that humankind \r\nlacks the material, financial or technological resources \r\nto eradicate poverty, hunger, preventable diseases and \r\nother scourges. What is missing is political will among \r\nthe industrialized countries, which have the moral duty, \r\nthe historical responsibility and abundant resources to \r\nsolve the most pressing global problems. The truth is \r\nthat while funding shortfalls are cited as justification \r\nfor failing to attain the goals and targets of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development or address the \r\nincreasing impacts of climate change, $1.74 trillion was \r\nwasted on military expenditure in 2017 — the highest \r\nfigure since the end of the Cold War.\r\nClimate change is another unavoidable reality and \r\na question of survival for the human race, especially for \r\nsmall island developing States. Some of its effects are \r\nalready irreversible. Scientific evidence shows that the \r\naverage temperature has increased by 1.1°C compared \r\nto pre-industrial levels, and that nine out of 10 people \r\nliving in urban areas breathe polluted air. However, \r\nthe United States, one of the major polluters, both \r\nhistorically and today, refuses to join the international \r\ncommunity in implementing the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change. In so doing, it endangers the very lives \r\nof future generations and the survival of all species, \r\nincluding humans.\r\nFurthermore, as if there were not enough threats to \r\nhumankind and its dazzling creations, it is a fact that \r\nmilitary and nuclear hegemony not only continues but \r\nis extending its reach, dashing the hopes of the majority \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 33/52\r\nof peoples for general and complete disarmament. Cuba \r\nshares this ideal and, as evidence of its commitment to \r\nthat aim, on 31 January became the fifth State to ratify \r\nthe Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nIt is impossible for the Organization, born of the \r\ndesire to overcome through dialogue among nations \r\nthe destruction wrought by an horrific war, to remain \r\nsilent about the dangers that threaten us all with the \r\nexacerbation of local conflicts, wars of aggression \r\ndisguised as humanitarian intervention, the forceful \r\noverthrow of sovereign Governments, so-called \r\nsoft coups and interference in other States’ internal \r\naffairs — all of which are established behaviours on the \r\npart of certain Powers, under a wild range of pretexts.\r\nInternational cooperation to promote and protect \r\nhuman rights for all is imperative, but it is manipulated \r\nin a discriminatory and selective way in an attempt to \r\ndominate, violating the rights of peoples to peace, self-\r\ndetermination and development.\r\nCuba rejects the militarization of outer space and \r\ncyberspace, as well as the covert and illegal use of \r\ninformation and communication technologies to attack \r\nother States.\r\nMultilateralism and full respect for the norms and \r\nprinciples of international law to advance towards a \r\ndemocratic, equitable multipolar world are necessary \r\nto ensure peaceful coexistence, maintain international \r\npeace and security and find lasting solutions to \r\nsystemic problems.\r\nRunning counter to this vision, threats or use \r\nof force, unilateralism, pressure, retaliation and \r\nsanctions — which increasingly characterize the \r\nbehaviour and rhetoric of the United States Government \r\nand its abusive use of the veto power in the Security \r\nCouncil to impose its political agenda — represent \r\nimmense challenges that threaten the very institution of \r\nthe United Nations. Why do we not simply implement \r\nthe promised strengthening of the General Assembly \r\nas the principal deliberative, decision-making and \r\nmost representative organ? Security Council reform \r\nmust not be delayed or sidelined; it must be updated to \r\nreflect the times and democratize its membership and \r\nworking methods.\r\nWe reiterate today what Commander-in-Chief of the \r\nCuban revoluation Fidel Castro Ruz said on the occasion \r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. His \r\nsentiments reflect the most noble aspirations of the \r\nmajority of humankind:\r\n“We lay claim to a world without hegemonism, \r\nwithout nuclear weapons, without interventionism, \r\nwithout racism, without national or religious \r\nhatred, without outrageous acts against the \r\nsovereignty of any country, a world with respect \r\nfor the independence and self-determination of \r\npeoples, a world without universal models that \r\ntotally disregard the traditions and culture of all the \r\ncomponents of mankind.\r\n“We lay claim to a world without ruthless \r\nblockades that cause the death of men, women \r\nand children, young and old, like noiseless atom \r\nbombs.” (A/50/PV.35, pp. 19-20)\r\nMore than 20 years have passed since that demand \r\nwas made, and none of those ills has been cured; on \r\nthe contrary, they have got worse. We have every \r\nright to ask why and the duty to insist on effective and \r\nfair solutions.\r\nOur Americas are today the scene of persistent \r\nthreats that are incompatible with the proclamation of \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace, \r\nsigned in Havana in 2014 by the Heads of State and \r\nGovernment at the second Summit of the Community \r\nof Latin American and Caribbean States. The current \r\nUnited States Administration has proclaimed the validity \r\nof the Monroe Doctrine and, in a new deployment of its \r\nimperial policy in the region, is attacking Venezuela \r\nwith particular cruelty.\r\nIn this menacing climate, we reiterate our absolute \r\nsupport for the Bolivarian and Chavista revolution, \r\nthe civic-military union of the Venezuelan people \r\nand its legitimate democratic Government, led by \r\nConstitutional President Nicolás Maduros Moros. \r\nWe reject the interventionist intent of the sanctions \r\nagainst Venezuela, aimed at economic strangulation \r\nand damaging Venezuelan families. We reject calls to \r\nisolate that sovereign nation, which is doing no harm \r\nto anyone.\r\nWe likewise reject the attempts to destabilize the \r\nGovernment of Nicaragua, a peaceful country that has \r\nmade remarkable social and economic progress and \r\nimproved security for its citizens.\r\nWe denounce the political imprisonment of former \r\nPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the decision \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n34/52 18-29871\r\nto prevent the people from voting for Brazil’s most \r\npopular leader and electing him to the presidency.\r\nWe stand in solidarity with the Caribbean nations \r\ndemanding legitimate reparations for the horrific legacy \r\nof slavery as well as the fair, special and differential \r\ntreatment they deserve.\r\nWe reaffirm our long-standing support for the \r\nself-determination and independence of the brotherly \r\npeople of Puerto Rico.\r\nWe support Argentina’s legitimate claim to \r\nsovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia \r\nIslands and South Sandwich Islands.\r\nWe reiterate our full support for a comprehensive, \r\njust and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict, based on the establishment of two States, \r\npermitting the Palestinian people to exercise their right \r\nto self-determination in a sovereign independent State \r\nbased on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital. We reject the unilateral action of the United \r\nStates in establishing its diplomatic representation in \r\nthe city of Jerusalem, which has further heightened \r\ntensions in the region. We condemn the barbarous acts \r\ncommitted by the Israeli forces against the civilian \r\npopulation in Gaza.\r\nWe reaffirm our steadfast solidarity with the \r\nSahrawi people and support the questfor a definitive \r\nsolution to the question of Western Sahara that allows \r\nthem to exercise their right to self-determination and to \r\nlive in peace in their territory.\r\nWe support the search for a peaceful and negotiated \r\nsolution to the situation imposed on Syria, without \r\nforeign interference and in full respect for the country’s \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We reject any \r\ndirect or indirect intervention executed without the \r\nagreement of the legitimate authorities of that country.\r\nThe continued expansion of NATO towards \r\nthe Russian border is provoking significant danger, \r\naggravated further still by the imposition of arbitrary \r\nsanctions, which we reject.\r\nWe demand that the nuclear agreement with the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran be implemented.\r\nWe welcome the process of inter-Korean \r\nrapprochement and dialogue, which represents \r\nthe path towards lasting peace, reconciliation and \r\nstability on the Korean peninsula. At the same time, \r\nwe strongly condemn the imposition of unilateral \r\nand unjust sanctions against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and foreign interference in Korean \r\ninternal affairs.\r\nThe violation of international trade rules, and the \r\nimposition of sanctions against China, the European \r\nUnion and other countries will result in harmful effects, \r\nin particular for developing countries.\r\nWe favour dialogue and cooperation, thanks to \r\nwhich we can report today that the Political Dialogue \r\nand Cooperation Agreement between the European \r\nUnion and Cuba has provisionally entered into force, \r\nrepresenting a strong foundation on which to build \r\nbeneficial ties between the parties.\r\nThe Government of the United States maintains its \r\naggressive rhetoric towards Cuba and a policy aimed at \r\nsubverting the political, social, economic and cultural \r\nsystem of my country. Contrary to the interests of \r\nboth peoples and giving in to pressure from minority \r\ninterests, the United States Government has engaged in \r\nfabricating pretexts to stoke false tensions and hostilities \r\nthat benefit no one. This is in stark contrast with the \r\nfact that we maintain formal diplomatic relations \r\nand participate in mutually beneficial cooperation \r\nprogrammes in a limited number of areas. Our peoples \r\nshare increasingly close historical and cultural bonds, \r\nas expressed through the arts, sports, science and the \r\nenvironment, among other areas. The potential for a \r\nhealthy commercial relationship is well recognized, \r\nand a genuine relationship of respect would benefit the \r\ninterests of the entire region.\r\nHowever, the defining core component of the \r\nbilateral relationship remains the embargo, which is \r\nintended to strangle the Cuban economy, generate \r\npoverty and disrupt constitutional order. It is a cruel \r\npolicy that punishes Cuban families and the entire \r\nnation. It is the most comprehensive and long-standing \r\nsystem of economic sanctions ever implemented against \r\nany country. It has been and remains a major obstacle \r\nto the country’s development and to the realization \r\nof the aspirations for progress and well-being of \r\nseveral generations of Cubans. As reiterated from this \r\nvery rostrum for many years, through its aggressive \r\nextraterritorial implementation the embargo seriously \r\ndamages the sovereignty and interests of all countries.\r\nOn behalf of the Cuban people, I thank the General \r\nAssembly for its near-unanimous rejection of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States against my country. However, \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 35/52\r\nthat Government’s actions against my country go even \r\nfurther, to include public and covert programmes of \r\ngross interference in Cuba’s internal affairs, using tens \r\nof millions of dollars officially allocated in the budget \r\nto that purpose, in violation of the norms and principles \r\nupon which this Organization is based and, in particular, \r\nof Cuba’s sovereignty as an independent nation.\r\nCuba stands ready to foster respectful and civilized \r\nrelations with the United States Government, based on \r\nsovereign equality and mutual respect. That is the will \r\nof the Cuban people and an aspiration that we know to \r\nbe shared by the majority of the citizens of the United \r\nStates, especially the Cubans living there.\r\nWe will continue tirelessly demanding the end of \r\nthe cruel economic, commercial and financial embargo, \r\nthe return of the territory illegally occupied by the \r\nUnited States Naval Base in Guantánamo and adequate \r\ncompensation to our people for the thousands of deaths \r\nand injuries and the economic and property damage \r\ncaused by this aggression over so many years.\r\nCuba will always remain willing to engage in \r\ndialogue and cooperation based on respect and equal \r\ntreatment. We will never make concessions that affect \r\nour national sovereignty and independence. We will \r\nnot barter our principles or accept conditions. In spite \r\nof the embargo, the hostility and actions of the United \r\nStates to impose regime change on Cuba, the Cuban \r\nrevolution remains alive and strong, steadfast and \r\nfaithful to its principles.\r\nThe enemies of the revolution should not be \r\ndeluded by the generational change in our Government. \r\nWe represent continuity, not any sort of rupture. Cuba \r\nhas continued taking steps to improve its model of \r\neconomic and social development with a view to \r\nbuilding a sovereign, independent, socialist, democratic, \r\nprosperous and sustainable nation. That is the path that \r\nour people havefreely chosen. The Cuban people will \r\nnever return to the disgraces of the past, from which it \r\nfreed itself by the greatest of sacrifices over 150 years \r\nof struggle for independence and dignity. In accordance \r\nwith the will of the overwhelming majority of Cuban \r\nwomen and men, we shall press forward in the work \r\nthat began almost 60 years ago.\r\nIn this conviction, we have initiated a process of \r\nconstitutional reform — a truly participatory democratic \r\nexercise with public discussion of the draft text which \r\nwill later be submitted for approval by referendum. I \r\nam certain that there will be no changes in our strategic \r\nobjectives and that the irrevocable nature of socialism \r\nwill be reaffirmed. The principles of our foreign policy \r\nwill remain unchanged. As the First Secretary of our \r\nParty, Mr. Raúl Castro Ruz, said, on the occasion of the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the United Nations:\r\n“The international community can always \r\ndepend on Cuba to raise its honest voice against \r\ninjustice, inequality, underdevelopment, \r\ndiscrimination and manipulation and for the \r\nestablishment of a more equitable and fair \r\ninternational order that really focuses on the \r\nhuman being, his dignity and well-being.” (A/70/\r\nPV.14, p.6)\r\nThe Cuba on behalf of which I speak today is proud \r\nto carry the torch of that independent sovereign policy, \r\nwhich is bound by links of brotherhood and solidarity \r\nto the world’s poor, who produce all the world’s wealth \r\nbut are condemned to live in poverty by an unjust \r\nworld order under the cover of words like “democracy”, \r\n“freedom” and “human rights” — words which those in \r\npower have, in fact, emptied of all meaning.\r\nI am moved to be speaking from the same rostrum \r\nfrom which Fidel spoke the truth so powerfully 58 \r\nyears ago that it still resonates with the representatives \r\nof more than 190 nations who, rejecting extortion and \r\npressure, year on year turn the voting screen a dignified \r\ngreen with lights approving our demand for an end \r\nto the embargo. I close with the hope that the noble \r\naspirations shared by the majority of humankind may \r\nbe realized before yet further generations take to this \r\nrostrum to demand the very same things we demand \r\ntoday and our historic predecessors did before us.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Councils \r\nof State and of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, President \r\nof the Councils of State and of Ministers of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. George Manneh Weah, President of \r\nthe Republic of Liberia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Liberia.\r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n36/52 18-29871\r\nMr. George Manneh Weah, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. George Manneh Weah, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Liberia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Weah: I am honoured to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session on behalf \r\nof the Government and the people of Liberia. I should \r\nlike at the outset to congratulate the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and the Government and the people \r\nof Ecuador, on her election to serve as President of the \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session. With our eyes \r\non history, Liberia takes special note of the fact she is \r\nthe fourth woman to serve as President of the General \r\nAssembly, and we welcome her election.\r\nI should also like to express my appreciation to \r\nSecretary-General António Guterres, whose dynamism \r\nand far-sighted leadership continues to strengthen the \r\nUnited Nations in the face of perennial global challenges.\r\nJust two weeks ago, we joined millions in Ghana \r\nand around the world in bidding final farewell to \r\nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who devoted \r\nhis life to peacemaking and conflict resolution — a \r\ncalling in which he was renowned and successful. With \r\nhis passing, Africa has lost one of its most illustrious \r\nsons and the world has lost one of the most outstanding \r\ndiplomats of our time. May his soul rest in perfect peace.\r\nLate last year, Liberians participated in presidential \r\nand legislative elections, the results of which represented \r\na major shift in the underlying fundamentals of \r\nLiberian political dynamics. In an orderly, lawful and \r\npeaceful manner, Liberians voted in overwhelming \r\nnumbers for change and hope. This was the first time \r\nin 73 years that Liberians enjoyed a peaceful transfer \r\nof power from one democratically elected Government \r\nto another. At the end of the long campaign, when the \r\nresults were announced after the run-off, it became \r\nclear that the pendulum had swung in the direction of \r\nyouthful leadership and the paradigm had shifted in \r\nfavour of change and transformation.\r\nThe United Nations and its various bodies, as well \r\nas regional organizations and many of our bilateral \r\npartners and friends, directly witnessed the maturity of \r\nthe Liberian electorate, our respect for law and order, \r\nand our successful democratic processes. The mantle \r\nand responsibility for leading that transformation was \r\nthereby placed on my shoulders, as the standard-bearer \r\nof the winning Coalition for Democratic Change, with \r\nmy inauguration, on 22 January, as the twenty-fourth \r\nPresident of Liberia. The challenges of leadership \r\nare enormous, but, in each and every one of those \r\nchallenges, I see opportunities to make things better \r\nand to bring permanent improvements to the lives of all \r\nLiberians, as we devise policies and programmes that \r\nwill have a lasting and positive impact on the lives of \r\nour citizens.\r\nThe umbrella programme under which we intend \r\nto pursue prosperity is the Pro-Poor Agenda for \r\nDevelopment and Prosperity, our national development \r\nplan for the next five years. The Agenda is not only for \r\nthe poor, it is for the benefit of all Liberians. But it is \r\npolicy framework that gives priority to the alleviation \r\nof poverty, and its core objective and focus are to reduce \r\nthe marginalization of the most vulnerable, while also \r\ncreating a conducive atmosphere for middle- and upper-\r\nincome Liberians to grow and prosper. We want to build \r\na harmonious society based on the goal of economic \r\nempowerment, especially for the underprivileged. Our \r\nPro-Poor Agenda is therefore designed to give power to \r\nthe people, promote economic diversification, protect \r\nsustainable peace and encourage good governance. We \r\nappeal to our friends, bilateral partners and private \r\ninvestors to support the Agenda.\r\nAs we focus on action plans to implement our \r\ndevelopment Agenda, we are acutely aware of the \r\nvulnerability of our youthful population, who are clearly \r\ndisadvantaged as a result of high unemployment and a \r\nlack of access to quality educational opportunities. Our \r\nplan is to reverse their unfortunate situation and help \r\nthem become productive citizens through the provision \r\nof adequate educational facilities at the high-school \r\nand college levels for those who remain interested in \r\npursuing academic programmes. For those youths \r\nleft behind due to the disastrous civil crisis and who \r\nhave outgrown their school years, my Government \r\nis investing in technical vocational education and \r\ntraining programmes to build their entrepreneurial and \r\nmarketable skillsets.\r\nConscious of the importance and impact of \r\ninfrastructure on social and economic development, my \r\nGovernment has identified investment in roads, energy \r\nand ports as our key priority, and is therefore soliciting \r\nfunding and other technical expertise to undertake \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 37/52\r\nthose projects in pursuit of our goal to connect our \r\ncities and towns and power our economy.\r\nAgriculture, Liberia’s comparative advantage, \r\nhas also been identified as one of our major poverty-\r\nalleviation instruments, since it can lead us to self-\r\nsufficiency in food production and self-employment, \r\nas well as open doors to industrialization. With the \r\nimplementation of a new special economic zone, we \r\nintend to attract labour-intensive light manufacturing.\r\nDrawing on the experience of the 2014 Ebola \r\nepidemic, which took the lives of thousands of \r\nLiberians and health workers, we intend to efficiently \r\nand properly organize our health-care delivery system, \r\nto ensure that the health and well-being of our people \r\nis improved.\r\nFinally, we are placing emphasis on national \r\nsecurity in order to enable our people to move and \r\nlive freely without fear. With the recent withdrawal of \r\nthe United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), we \r\nare now in charge of our own security. We thank the \r\ninternational community for the sacrifices made in \r\nsecuring and maintaining the peace in Liberia after our \r\nprotracted civil conflict. In that regard, I would like \r\nto express my personal appreciation to Mr. Farid Zarif \r\nof Afghanistan, who, as the Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General for Liberia and the last Head of \r\nUNMIL, from 2015 to 2018, supervised the orderly \r\nwithdrawal of troops, while simultaneously securing \r\nthe peaceful environment that allowed a very robust \r\npolitical campaign to take place without incident.\r\nMy country has finally turned the corner, having \r\nnow experienced more years of peace than the preceding \r\nyears of war, guided by our Peace Agreement, signed \r\nin Accra 15 years ago. We thank the members and the \r\nSecurity Council for the UNMIL peacekeeping mission, \r\nwhich brought stability and helped us rebuild our \r\ninstitutions and communities. We are a peacekeeping \r\nsuccess story, and we are grateful for the support we \r\nwere given.\r\nBut a nation that has experienced civil war must \r\nnever take peace for granted or forget the long shadow \r\nthat years of conflict still cast over people’s lives. \r\nWe must realize and appreciate that ours is still a \r\nfragile peace.\r\nOur people across the country still bear the scars \r\nof conflict. We therefore intend to initiate a series of \r\nnational peace dialogues throughout Liberia. We must \r\nrelaunch those difficult conversations at the local \r\nlevel and include our youth, so that they, and we, do \r\nnot repeat the costly mistakes of the past. It is clear to \r\nme that such frank exchanges are an essential step in \r\nbringing lasting healing, reconciliation and unity to our \r\npeople. Our agenda is not one of division, but rather one \r\nthat intends to provide an enabling environment for a \r\nunited and reconciled people to be able to benefit and \r\nprosper from the economic dividends of peace.\r\nI recall with humility that I was once selected to \r\nserve as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, a mission that \r\nI undertook with passion, conviction and commitment \r\nto support and inform the world about principles for \r\nwhich this Organization stands. I was also privileged \r\nto be appointed as Messenger of Peace for Liberia, a \r\nmandate to apply these principles: preserving and \r\nmaintaining peace, which the peacekeeping mission \r\nhad so successful restored. I deeply and personally \r\ncherish those principles.\r\nTherefore, today, in concluding, I wish to reaffirm \r\nthe support of my Government for the work of the \r\nUnited Nations in striving to achieve global peace, \r\ncounter terrorism and reform the United Nations, as \r\nwell as to achieve reform, security, good governance \r\nand the advancement of the principle of universal \r\nhuman rights. We further reiterate our commitment \r\nto the rule of law, the alleviation of poverty, gender \r\nequality, the elimination of gender-based violence and \r\nthe empowerment of women, girls and young people. I \r\nalso believe that the overwhelming mandate I received \r\nfrom the Liberian people is one to end corruption in \r\nthe public service, and I remain fully committed to \r\nthat task.\r\nWith the generous assistance and strong support of \r\nthe United Nations, as well as that of other international \r\ninstitutions and Member States, and with God’s \r\nblessing, we will fulfil our agenda to lift our people out \r\nof poverty to prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Liberia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. George Manneh Weah, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n38/52 18-29871\r\nAddress by Mr. Andrej Kiska, President of the \r\nSlovak Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Slovak Republic.\r\nMr. Andrej Kiska, President of the Slovak Republic, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Andrej Kiska, President \r\nof the Slovak Republic, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Kiska: It takes decades to build peace \r\nand trust, but it only takes seconds, one selfish or \r\nnarrow-minded decision, to break them. We gather here \r\nevery year to enhance what we have been building for \r\nover 70 years: an idea of a world based on rules and \r\nthe principles of humanity, responsibility, tolerance and \r\npeaceful coexistence, where wars and armed conflicts \r\nhave no place, where disputes are solved in dialogue and \r\nwhere challenges are addressed through cooperation.\r\nWe are continuously becoming wealthier and more \r\nadvanced. With all the resources we can generate \r\ntogether, we might have the means necessary to \r\nreach even the poorest of the poor. Yet we are more \r\noften driven by selfishness and short-term interests. \r\nInstead of enlarging freedom, cooperation and healthy \r\ncompetition, we introduce restrictions and trade \r\nwars. While globalization has created unprecedented \r\nwealth, inequalities still divide our planet. Economic \r\nfigures are positive but, in many parts of our world, \r\nhave hardly translated into improved well-being and \r\ndignity for every human being. At an amazing pace, \r\nwe continue to develop technologies allowing us to \r\nconnect, communicate and be closer globally. But the \r\ndistance between people and the gap in understanding \r\nand empathy towards other cultures remains huge. Yet, \r\nthanks to innovation, the world has never been smaller. \r\nWhat happens thousands of kilometres away can turn \r\ninto a global problem in a matter of minutes, and global \r\nproblems have a direct impacts on our citizens. Against \r\nthat backdrop, the United Nations plays an irreplaceable \r\nrole. It has enormous potential to overcome those \r\nparadoxes. Its strong principles, responsible action and \r\nability to drive cooperation are what make it so unique. \r\nLet me touch upon those aspects in more detail.\r\nRules and principles and their enforcement must \r\nremain the backbone of the Organization because today \r\nit seems that playing by the rules has become old-\r\nfashioned, as if ignoring them were a sign of strength \r\nand respect a sign of weakness.\r\nThe number of armed conflicts has increased in \r\nrecent years. In only 2016 and 2017, the number of \r\nconflicts equalled the peak of the Cold War era. The \r\nnumber of civilian casualties rise. We are talking about \r\nhundreds of thousands of innocent people directly \r\naffected by conflicts and war.\r\nSovereignty and territorial integrity are the DNA \r\nof global and regional stability and security. But the \r\noccupation of Georgia and Ukraine and destabilization \r\nin the region are just one of many examples of respect \r\nfor rules being replaced by ruthless power politics.\r\nThe threat of nuclear weapons resonates much more \r\noften than we could have imagined in the recent years. \r\nWe hope that the developments under way in North \r\nKorea will bring about tangible results. We must make \r\nsure that agreements will be kept. And if not, we need \r\nto act with resolve.\r\nToo often we see thousands of civilians massacred \r\nby their very regimes, or in endless conflicts, as if we \r\nhad become unmoved by the breaching of the very \r\nnorms of humanity and stopped counting the innocent \r\nlives lost in Syria, Yemen, Palestine, Myanmar, South \r\nSudan and elsewhere.\r\nTogether we have agreed that the use of weapons \r\nof mass destruction is unacceptable, without exception. \r\nAny use of chemical weapons must be a red line and not \r\ntolerated — an automatic trigger for resolute action. It \r\nis therefore shameful to see the tyrannical regime in \r\nSyria repeatedly use chemical weapons against its own \r\ncitizens for the sake of survival. As for us, Europeans, \r\nit is shocking to witness the attacks in Salisbury, Great \r\nBritain, with the perpetrators avoiding responsibility \r\nand shamelessly denying the facts.\r\nIt is our responsibility to make sure that no \r\nperpetrator escapes unpunished. We must firmly \r\nshow that we will not allow our principles to be bent \r\nto aggressive politics, that we will not undermine the \r\nauthority of this Organization by inaction.\r\nWe all have a great responsibility towards our \r\ncitizens, the international community and the planet to \r\nlead, to stand firmly behind our values and to defend \r\nthem. We must listen to our people not only to address \r\ntheir problems, but also to see far enough to inspire \r\nthem, in particular vis-à-vis extremism, populism, \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 39/52\r\nradicalism, xenophobia, racism, propaganda, lies, the \r\ntwisting of the truth, and terrorism. Their goals are \r\nsimple and yet effective: to spread fear, hatred and doubt, \r\nerode our beliefs and values and undermine our unity. \r\nThey provide seemingly quick and simple solutions, \r\nprovoking confrontation and drawing dividing lines. \r\nIt is no surprise they find fertile soil everywhere we \r\nfail to deliver. People living in poverty, aff licted by \r\nhunger or disease, with no access to education or health \r\ncare are among their natural targets. And we will not \r\nwin this fight if we do not offer those people and their \r\nchildren hope for a better life of dignity, free of fear of \r\nhunger or death. That is why our unity in implementing \r\nthe development goals, in fighting climate change and \r\naddressing migration is so important. We need to turn \r\nour plans and our promises into a global reality. Failing \r\nto do so only sends a signal of our weakness, leaving \r\nthose people and this planet as easy prey.\r\nThe unprecedented progress and innovation of new \r\ntechnology brings with it new challenges. I am very \r\nconcerned about malicious activities in cyberspace. \r\nGrowing manipulation through social media is \r\nundermining democracy worldwide and indoctrinating \r\nour populations. Cyberspace knows no borders. It is \r\nanonymous and provides unlimited room to strike \r\nat us. The choice of means is endless: to manipulate \r\nelections, to influence decisions, to spy on us or sneak \r\ninto our computers, networks and everyday lives. It \r\nis as dangerous as any conventional threat. As such \r\nit requires our utmost attention. But, to date, we have \r\ndone nothing or little about it. Global companies prefer \r\ntheir profits over their responsibilities. It is therefore up \r\nto us, States, to set new standards and, where needed, \r\nregulations — because today we do not lead, we only \r\nfollow. And the price of inaction may soon be very high.\r\nMr. Messahel (Algeria), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nToo often, we hear political leaders issue calls to \r\nfight extremism and propaganda with the same tools \r\nand rhetoric. They could not be more wrong. The only \r\nhonest answer is to support tolerance, freedom of \r\nspeech and critical thinking in our societies. The only \r\npotent defence is to strengthen our values and to bring \r\ncandid solutions to people’s problems. Only when we \r\ndeliver may our democratic ideology become immune \r\nto extremist ideas and propaganda. In that effort, we \r\nneed to remember that free media are our allies, not \r\nour enemies. They are guardians of our principles. \r\nThey are often the first to spot when things go in \r\nthe wrong direction. They hold those who break the \r\nrules accountable.\r\nWe should therefore be worried indeed about \r\nincreased attacks on journalists, attempts to eliminate \r\nthe freedom of the press, and growing restrictions on \r\ncivil societies. Sadly, last year dozens of journalists \r\nwere killed, hundreds imprisoned and thousands \r\noppressed. The climate of hate continues to spread, \r\nportraying them as enemies of the State, enemies of \r\nnations or even of faiths. But they play a key role in \r\nour mission for a better world, and as such they must \r\nbe protected.\r\nNone of our countries, even the most powerful, is \r\nbig enough to face present challenges on its own, be \r\nthey migration, terrorism, climate change or sustaining \r\nsolid economic growth. While our most important duty \r\nas politicians is to serve our people, that will be possible \r\nonly if we truly understand the value of cooperation \r\nand that, if we truly want to change the world for the \r\nbetter, we need to think of others — individuals, nations \r\nand countries — and patiently explain this principle to \r\nour people.\r\nAs Kofi Annan said,\r\n“More than ever before in human history, we share \r\na common destiny. We can master it only if we face \r\nit together. And that, my friends, is why we have \r\nthe United Nations”.\r\nI admit that multilateralism is not always easy, but it \r\nis the only sustainable way. The United Nations will \r\nserve its purpose as long as we, the Member States, \r\nhold true to our commitments and stand ready to \r\ndefend rules and principles. The noble ideals and strong \r\nprinciples of this Organization — the steadfast values \r\nof tolerance, empathy, compassion and solidarity — are \r\nour best tools for facing any challenge. If we protect \r\nthose values, the moral compass of humankind, \r\nthen the evil of aggressive power politics, selfish \r\nnationalism, extremism and racism will not prevail. We \r\nmay not know what comes tomorrow, but we know how \r\nto respond if we let the moral compass guide us. The \r\nbest assurance we can have in times of uncertainty is to \r\nprotect our values.\r\nI wish to conclude by congratulating the President \r\nof the General Assembly on assuming her duties. The \r\nchallenges I spoke about are not easy to tackle, but I \r\nhave full confidence that the United Nations and her \r\nOffice will guide the Assembly through these times \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n40/52 18-29871\r\nwith the utmost dedication to fulfilling our common \r\ngoals. I therefore also wish proudly to thank and \r\ncongratulate her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, for \r\nthe professionalism with which he served the United \r\nNations and its peoples.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Slovak Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Andrej Kiska, President of the Slovak Republic, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Moon Jae-in, President of the \r\nRepublic of Korea\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Moon Jae-in, President of the Republic of Korea, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Moon Jae-in, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Korea, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Moon Jae-in (spoke in Korean; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I would like \r\nto express my deepest condolences on the passing away \r\nof Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations. The world will forever remember his \r\nname, which has been etched in the road to peace.\r\nI would like to congratulate Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés on assuming the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session. I hope \r\nthe United Nations will be able to reach out to every \r\ncorner of the globe through this session. I also hope \r\nthat the United Nations will make further progress \r\nin contributing to the international community \r\nunder the excellent leadership of Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres.\r\nAs I did last year (see A/72/PV.11), I stand here once \r\nagain with a sense of urgency and excitement. Something \r\nmiraculous has taken place on the Korean peninsula \r\nover the past year. For the first time in history, the leader \r\nof North Korea crossed the Military Demarcation Line \r\nto visit Panmunjeom. A historic summit between the \r\nUnited States and North Korea was held on the island \r\nof Sentosa in Singapore. Chairman Kim Jong Un and \r\nI removed the shadow of war and resolved to usher in \r\nan era of peace and prosperity. At the United States-\r\nNorth Korea summit, the two sides agreed to work \r\ntowards achieving the complete denuclearization on \r\nthe Korean peninsula, thereby ending hostile relations \r\nand establishing a permanent peace regime. President \r\nTrump and Chairman Kim took action and gave hope \r\nto those who desire peace an around the world. North \r\nKorea dismantled its nuclear test site in Punggye-ri, \r\nunder the observation of the international community. \r\nThe United States and the Republic of Korea suspended \r\nlarge-scale joint military exercises and built trust. I \r\nwould like to thank and salute President Trump and \r\nChairman Kim’s courage and resolve as they usher in a \r\nnew era on the Korean peninsula, as well as in United \r\nStates-North Korea relations.\r\nLast week in Pyongyang, I met Chairman Kim for \r\nthe third time and reached an agreement once again to \r\nturn the Korean peninsula into a land of peace, free \r\nfrom nuclear weapons and threats. Chairman Kim \r\nexpressed his hope of completing denuclearization as \r\nsoon as possible to focus on economic development. \r\nMoreover, Chairman Kim expressed his commitment to \r\npermanently dismantling the missile-engine test site and \r\nlaunch platform in Dongchang-ri, under the observation \r\nof the international community as a first step in order \r\nto expedite progress in denuclearization. Furthermore, \r\nhe expressed his firm willingness to continue to take \r\nadditional denuclearization measures, including the \r\npermanent dismantlement of nuclear facilities in \r\nYongbyon, as the United States takes corresponding \r\nmeasures in the spirit of the Sentosa agreement.\r\nThe Korean peninsula has remained under the \r\nArmistice for the past 65 years. Ending the Korean War \r\nis an urgent task. It is a process we must go through in \r\norder to move towards a peace regime. I look forward to \r\nseeing bold measures for denuclearization implemented \r\namong the countries concerned, thereby leading to a \r\ndeclaration to end the war. Regardless of the challenges \r\nthat lie ahead, the leaders of the south, the north and \r\nthe United States will move step by step towards peace \r\nbased on mutual trust. Such a dramatic change has been \r\npossible thanks to the support and encouragement of \r\npeople around the world who desire peace. The United \r\nNations in particular gave North Korea the courage to \r\nembark upon the road to peace. I would like to express \r\nmy gratitude to the United Nations for its role. However, \r\nthat is just the beginning. I would like to ask for \r\ncontinued support and cooperation from the Member \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 41/52\r\nStates on our journey towards complete denuclearization \r\nand permanent peace. The Republic of Korea will spare \r\nno effort to encourage North Korea’s participation in \r\nthe international community, while adhering to the \r\nresolutions adopted by the United Nations.\r\nA prelude to peace on the Korean peninsula unfolded \r\nin Pyeongcheng, Gangwon province last winter. It \r\nwas the moment when the Olympic Truce resolution \r\nadopted at the General Assembly in November 2017 \r\ncame to precious fruition. Secretary-General Guterres \r\nand many Heads of State extended their congratulations \r\non the participation of North Korean athletes and \r\nofficials in the Pyeongcheng Olympic Winter Games. \r\nThey expressed their wishes for unity and peace on the \r\nKorean peninsula. The world was awakened to the sense \r\nof a new history of peace being written. I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, for \r\nhis leadership and contribution in opening the way for \r\nNorth Korea to participate in the Pyeongcheng Olympic \r\nWinter Games. Just over a month after the close of the \r\nPyeongcheng Paralympic Winter Games, Chairman \r\nKim and I met for the first time in Panmunjeom. The \r\nUnited Nations welcomed and actively supported the \r\nadoption of the Panmunjeom Declaration. By doing \r\nso, it provided tremendous strength to the meetings \r\nthat have followed, including the second inter-Korean \r\nsummit, the United States-North Korea summit and the \r\nrecent inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang.\r\nAt the seventy-second session of the General \r\nAssembly, I expressed the hope that North Korea would \r\nchoose peace of its own accord in order to establish \r\nsound and sustainable peace. That hope was shared \r\nby the United Nations and the entire international \r\ncommunity. North Korea responded positively to our \r\nhopes and calls. Chairman Kim changed the direction of \r\nthe political situation on the Korean peninsula through \r\nhis New Year’s address on the first day of this year. The \r\nparticipation of North Korea’s athletes and delegation \r\nin the Pyeongcheng Winter Olympics provided the \r\ndecisive momentum to break the impasse in building \r\npeace. On 20 April, North Korea officially ended its \r\npolicy of nuclear development and has since devoted all \r\nof its efforts to economic development. On 9 September, \r\nduring the ceremony marking the seventieth anniversary \r\nof its founding, North Korea expressed its commitment \r\nto peace and prosperity instead of boasting about its \r\nnuclear capabilities. North Korea moved out of long-\r\nstanding isolation on its own initiative and stands before \r\nthe international community once again. Now it is the \r\ninternational community’s turn to respond positively to \r\nNorth Korea’s new choices and efforts. We must assure \r\nChairman Kim that he has made the right decision in \r\ncommitting to denuclearization. We must encourage \r\nNorth Korea to stay on the path that leads to permanent \r\nand solid peace.\r\nThe role of the United Nations is crucial. The \r\nSecretariat has continued its efforts for dialogue and \r\nengagement, including the invitation of North Korean \r\nofficials to international conferences. The United \r\nNations has announced its commitment to leave no one \r\nbehind. My sincere hope is that the vision of the United \r\nNations of sustainable development will be realized \r\non the Korean peninsula. I have no doubt that, if the \r\ninternational community paves the way, North Korea \r\nwill not stall in making strides towards peace and \r\nprosperity. The Republic of Korea will spare no effort \r\nin guiding North Korea towards that path. I would like \r\nto call on the United Nations to share its experience \r\nand wisdom.\r\nThe process of working towards denuclearization \r\nand establishing peace on the Korean peninsula is \r\none that also leads to building peace and cooperation \r\nin North-East Asia, which is home to one fifth of the \r\nworld’s population and accounts for a quarter of the \r\nglobal economy. However, regional conflicts stand in \r\nthe way of pursuing broader cooperation. We will begin \r\nthe work of resolving conflicts in North-East Asia \r\nstarting with the Korean peninsula.\r\nOn 15 August, I proposed the creation of an East \r\nAsian railroad community, which would involve six \r\nNorth-East Asian countries and the United States. \r\nThe European Coal and Steel Community, which gave \r\nbirth to the creation of the European Union, is a living \r\nexample of what that kind of initiative could achieve. \r\nI believe that the East Asian railroad community will \r\nbe able to serve as a starting point for the creation \r\nof an energy and economic community in East Asia, \r\nand, going a step further, lead to a multilateral peace \r\nand security architecture in North-East Asia. The two \r\nKoreas are working to reconnect disconnected railroads \r\nand roads. Going forward, the Republic of Korea will \r\nengage in close consultations with countries in the \r\nregion on concrete steps towards the East Asian railroad \r\ncommunity. As we work to realize the United Nations \r\nspirit of multilateralism and pave the way for a future \r\nof shared prosperity, I would like to ask for the support \r\nand cooperation of the international community.\r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n42/52 18-29871\r\nThe Republic of Korea, together with the United \r\nNations, has weathered the storms of modern history. \r\nThe United Nations and the Republic of Korea share \r\ncommon values and philosophies. This month, the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Korea announced its \r\nvision of an inclusive nation based on a people-centred \r\ngoverning philosophy. We are moving towards a \r\nfair and just nation, as well as a society in which no \r\none is discriminated against and everyone lives in \r\nharmony. Inclusiveness is also a philosophy embedded \r\nin international development cooperation. The \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Korea will steadily \r\nexpand its contribution to development cooperation to \r\ncreate a global community that leaves no one behind.\r\nThe Republic of Korea is also increasing its \r\nassistance to people who are suffering from human \r\nrights violations and discrimination, in particular the \r\nmost vulnerable groups, including children, youth, \r\nwomen and those with disabilities. We have increased \r\nour financial aid for refugees five times in the past five \r\nyears. Starting from this year, Korea is providing 50,000 \r\ntons of rice every year to developing countries that are \r\nsuffering from severe food crises. I believe that there \r\nneeds to be a holistic approach that encompasses peace, \r\ndevelopment and human rights so as to fundamentally \r\nresolve humanitarian crises. The Government of the \r\nRepublic of Korea will engage in discussions and \r\nprovide support to make the United Nations relevant to \r\nall people.\r\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. Anyone who has confronted the abuse of power \r\nto advance human rights carries in his or her heart the \r\nfirst clause of the Declaration — “All human beings \r\nare born free and equal”. In particular, I am working \r\nto realize gender equality in tangible ways, as an \r\nimportant part of our administrative agenda. All forms \r\nof discrimination and violence against women are being \r\ndealt with even more sternly. Korea has suffered directly \r\nfrom the Japanese military’s mobilization of comfort \r\nwomen. We will actively participate in discussions \r\nwithin the international community with regard to the \r\nissue of women and peace and security. We will also \r\nwork together with the international community in \r\nefforts to eradicate sexual violence in conflict.\r\nResponding to climate change and transitioning to \r\na low-carbon economy are challenges and tasks facing \r\nour generation. The Government of the Republic of \r\nKorea will raise its share of renewable energy in the \r\nnation’s total power generation to 20 per cent by 2030. \r\nWe will faithfully implement the goal of reducing \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2030, in compliance with \r\nthe Paris Agreement, and assist developing countries in \r\ntheir pursuit of sustainable development by supporting \r\nthem with climate-change responses.\r\nFor the two Koreas, the significance of the United \r\nNations goes beyond any international organization. \r\nOn 17 September 1991, at the forty-sixth session of \r\nthe General Assembly, the then 159 States Members \r\nof the United Nations unanimously adopted resolution \r\n46/1 for the joint accession by South Korea and North \r\nKorea to the United Nations. Coincidentally, that day \r\nwas the International Day of Peace. In their respective \r\nspeeches, the representatives of South Korea and North \r\nKorea pledged that, although South Korea and North \r\nKorea had started as separate members, they would \r\neventually become one some day through reconciliation, \r\ncooperation and peace (see A/46/PV.1). Now, 27 years \r\nlater, South Korea and North Korea are realizing the \r\npledge made on that day. We have crossed the barriers \r\nof division and are tearing down the walls in our hearts. \r\nWe are proving to the international community that, \r\nwhen we come together, we have sufficient means to \r\nestablish peace.\r\nWe all desire peace. Peace represents the relatives \r\nand neighbours we love and the home towns we long \r\nfor. Peace means sharing what we have together. A \r\npeace we have all achieved together is a peace for all. \r\nI am confident that all members will be with us always \r\non the path to permanent peace and denuclearization \r\non the Korean peninsula, as well as on the journey to a \r\npeaceful world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Korea for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Moon Jae-in, President of the Republic of Korea, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, President \r\nof Romania\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President \r\nof Romania.\r\n Mr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, President of Romania, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 43/52\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Klaus Werner \r\nIohannis, President of Romania, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Iohannis: I am particularly honoured \r\nto address this year’s session, as 2018 is a symbolic \r\nyear for Romania. One hundred years ago, Romanians \r\naccomplished their great dream, that of living together \r\nin one united country. The centenary of a united and \r\nmodern Romania is not only about my country’s past \r\nbut, even more, about the future. My strong conviction \r\nis that a safer and prosperous future for the Romanian \r\npeople can be accomplished only alongside peaceful \r\nand sustainable societies all over the world.\r\nThe United Nations, too, has reasons to celebrate \r\nthis year. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nis turning 70 years old, and so is the International \r\nLaw Commission, the main United Nations body \r\nresponsible for shaping international law in order for \r\nthe international community to become a better place \r\nwhere international rule of law governs us all.\r\nSuch anniversaries are a reminder of our political \r\ndetermination to stand up for our fundamental rights \r\nand the law, although the road has neither been short \r\nnor easy. Our action as political leaders is driven by a \r\nresponsibility towards our people. We serve our people \r\nwhen working with the United Nations, and each and \r\nevery citizen needs to see a concrete impact on his or \r\nher daily life and a positive change. I therefore welcome \r\nthe invitation of the President of the General Assembly \r\nto comment on the continuing relevance of the United \r\nNations for the lives and well-being of all peoples. We \r\nhave to explain the current challenges to peace, equity \r\nand sustainability of our societies and speak more about \r\nthe role of the United Nations in addressing them. We \r\nmust explain that we face serious threats to security, that \r\nterrorism needs a globally coordinated response and \r\nthat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\nand their means of delivery remain existential threats to \r\nglobal security. Pointing them out is necessary, but not \r\nenough. We need to address them by coming up with \r\nclear solutions. Romania is working in that respect in \r\nits region. Unfortunately, there are unresolved conflicts \r\nin the wider Black Sea area that pose serious threats to \r\nthe region itself and to international security.\r\nThree years ago, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development — a unique universal agenda \r\nfor progress — and set 17 ambitious goals that have a \r\nsignificant impact on the most pressing challenges in \r\nthe everyday lives of our people. Romania, like many \r\nother countries, is in a learning process. One very useful \r\nexercise was the presentation of our national voluntary \r\nreview at the High-level Political Forum in July. At \r\nthe same time, we have a lot to share from our own \r\nexperience. Therefore, in April 2019, in partnership \r\nwith the United Nations Economic Commission for \r\nEurope, Romania will host a regional conference on the \r\ntheme “The 2030 Agenda: Partnerships for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment”. The countries of our region will have a \r\nchance to share good practices and lessons learned in \r\nthe process of implementing the 2030 Agenda and in \r\nidentifying strategic opportunities for addressing key \r\nsocial drivers in our region, as well as looking at areas \r\nof sustainability and common interest.\r\nFrom another perspective, we are satisfied with our \r\njoint efforts to prepare for the adoption of some very \r\nimportant international cooperative frameworks by \r\nthe end of 2018. The global compacts on refugees and \r\nregular migration will generate a common approach \r\non migration and displaced persons at the global \r\nlevel. In addition, negotiations on a global pact for the \r\nenvironment are about to start. The development of the \r\nconvention on the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nmarine biological diversity of areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction is in progress. Another Ocean Conference \r\nwill take place soon. It will be aimed at continuing \r\nengagement for safe, secure, clean and sustainably \r\nmanaged oceans at the global level. In addition, the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \r\nand the Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism \r\nremain paramount.\r\nThe list of achievements with a direct impact on \r\nour lives does not stop there, as we do not stop making \r\nprogress in our work together at the United Nations. \r\nAnd I believe that we can do more. We still have to work \r\non making the whole United Nations system, including \r\nthe Security Council, truly coordinated, efficient, \r\neffective, transparent, accountable and fit for the \r\nrealities of the international community of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. The next few months will be decisive \r\nfor United Nations reform. The implementation of the \r\nframework put in place as a result of the tireless work of \r\nthe Secretary-General, with the support of the Member \r\nStates, will ref lect the level of political determination \r\nof each country. Romania will continue to support \r\nthat effort.\r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n44/52 18-29871\r\nAs the next President of the Council of the European \r\nUnion, in the first half of 2019, Romania is determined \r\nto strengthen the European Union-United Nations \r\npartnership. And when I speak about engagement I do \r\nnot just mean politicians and diplomats. We must reach \r\nout to our young people, representatives of civil society, \r\njournalists and business people. We need them all for \r\nthe cause of multilateralism and global leadership.\r\nAs the Assembly knows, Romania is running for \r\na non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the \r\nterm 2020-2021. Through that candidature, we take \r\nour share of responsibility in the attempt to increase \r\nthe effectiveness of the Council. We hope that our \r\ntrack record within the United Nations will convince \r\nthe Assembly once again that Romania is committed \r\nto supporting the United Nations work for peace and \r\ndevelopment for all its Members. Peace, development \r\nand justice are foundational pillars in our multilateral \r\nstrategy. We respect our partners and rely on dialogue. \r\nWe count on members’ most valuable support for our \r\ncandidature. Romania will be a responsible partner in \r\npromoting a common United Nations agenda.\r\nWe have recognized the primary responsibility \r\nof the Security Council for international peace and \r\nsecurity, in accordance with the Charter of the United \r\nNations. As many crises today are multidimensional \r\nin nature, the Security Council could play a more \r\nprominent role in addressing more aspects that impact \r\npeace and security. For example, climate change \r\nhas become one of the toughest global challenges. \r\nIts consequences — be they water shortages, food \r\ninsecurity, the displacement of people or rising sea \r\nlevels — threaten lives all around the world. In addition \r\nto the efforts of other United Nations platforms to tackle \r\nclimate-related risks, the Security Council could create \r\na framework to address them in an integrated manner.\r\nWe welcomed the organization of a debate in \r\nthe Security Council in July on aspects of peace and \r\nsecurity related to climate change (see S/PV.8307), \r\nand we are ready to follow up on the topic if elected \r\nas a non-permanent member. Ahead of the preparation \r\nof the Secretary-General’s climate summit next year, \r\nduring its presidency of the Council of the European \r\nUnion Romania will host an international conference \r\non the theme “Building resilience to natural disasters”, \r\nas a platform to exchange views on how to assess and \r\nmore effectively address climate-related security risks \r\nand enhance the basis for a resilient future.\r\nI thank the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor the theme she chose for this year’s debate and \r\ncongratulate her on the important responsibilities she \r\nhas assumed. Let me extend our best wishes of success \r\nand assure her of the full cooperation of Romania.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Romania for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, President of Romania, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mrs. Theresa May, Prime Minister \r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland.\r\nMrs. Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Mrs. Theresa \r\nMay, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, and inviting her to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMrs. May (United Kingdom): On behalf of the \r\nUnited Kingdom, let me begin by paying tribute to an \r\noutstanding leader of the United Nations, who, sadly, \r\npassed away this summer. Kofi Annan was one of the \r\ngreat Secretaries-General, a tireless campaigner for \r\npeace and progress and a champion of human rights \r\nand human dignity, whose influence will continue to \r\nbe felt around the world for years to come. Over the \r\ncourse of his lifetime he witnessed the extraordinary \r\nprogress that we as a community of nations have made \r\nsince the Organization was founded: progress in which \r\nwe have more than halved the number of people living \r\nin extreme poverty in this century alone; progress in \r\nwhich the number of people killed in conflicts has \r\nfallen by three quarters in just over three decades; and \r\nprogress in which millions of our citizens lead healthier \r\nand longer lives and where, thanks to advances in \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 45/52\r\nhuman knowledge, medicine, science and technology, \r\nwe are presented with huge opportunities in the years \r\nahead. Yet today many are concerned about whether or \r\nnot that progress will continue and fearful about what \r\nthe future holds.\r\nFor the end of the Cold War did not, as many once \r\nbelieved, lead to the inevitable supremacy of open \r\neconomies and liberal democracies cooperating on the \r\nglobal stage for the common good. Today, instead, we \r\nface a loss of confidence in those very systems that \r\nhave delivered so much. The belief in free markets has \r\nbeen challenged by the financial crisis of 2008, the \r\nconcerns of those feeling left behind by globalization, \r\nthe anxieties about the pace and scale of technological \r\nchange and what that will mean for jobs and the \r\nunprecedented mass movements of people across \r\nborders, with all the pressures that can bring. And \r\nafter the military interventionism at the beginning of \r\nthe century, people question the rationale, and indeed \r\nlegitimacy, of the use of force and involving ourselves \r\nin crises and conflicts that are not ours, while at the \r\nsame time being repelled by the slaughter in Syria and \r\nour failure to end it.\r\nSuch doubts are entirely understandable; so too is \r\nthe demand for leadership. Those of us who believe in \r\ninclusive societies and open economies have a duty to \r\nrespond, learn the lessons of the past, meet people’s \r\nconcerns with practical actions, not beguiling illusions, \r\nand renew our confidence in the ideas and values that \r\nhave done so much to benefit so many for so long. For \r\nbe in no doubt, if we lack the confidence to step up, \r\nothers will.\r\nIn the last century, whether in the rise of fascism \r\nor the spread of communism, we have seen those on the \r\nextreme right and extreme left exploit people’s fears, \r\nstoke intolerance and racism, close down economies and \r\nsocieties and destroy the peace of nations. And today, \r\nonce more, we see worrying trends in the rise of such \r\nmovements in Europe and beyond. We have seen what \r\nhappens when countries slide into authoritarianism, \r\nslowly crushing the basic freedoms and rights of their \r\ncitizens. We have seen what happens when corrupt \r\noligarchies rob their nations of the wealth, resources \r\nand human capital that are so vital to unlocking a \r\nbrighter future for their citizens.\r\nWe have seen what happens when the natural \r\npatriotism that is a cornerstone of a healthy society is \r\nwarped into aggressive nationalism, exploiting fear and \r\nuncertainty to promote identity politics at home and \r\nbelligerent confrontation abroad, while breaking rules \r\nand undermining institutions. We see what happens \r\nwhen States like Russia f lagrantly breach international \r\nnorms — from the seizing of sovereign territory to \r\nthe reckless use of chemical weapons on the streets of \r\nBritain by agents of the Russian GRU. We have to show \r\nthere is a better way to meet the concerns of our people. \r\nThat way lies in global cooperation between strong \r\nand accountable States based on open economies and \r\ninclusive societies. It is a way that ensures that strong \r\nnation States provide the bonds that bring citizens \r\ntogether and that power remains accountable to those \r\nit is there to serve; that celebrates free markets and has \r\nthe confidence to reform them when they need to work \r\nbetter; and that demonstrates that delivering for one’s \r\ncitizens at home does not have to be at the expense of \r\nglobal cooperation and the values, rules and ideals that \r\nunderpin that.\r\nIndeed, cooperation and competition are not \r\nmutually exclusive. Only global cooperation based on \r\na set of agreed rules can ensure competition is fair and \r\ndoes not succumb to protectionism, with its certain path \r\nto lost jobs and international confrontation. It is only \r\nglobal cooperation that can harness legitimate self-\r\ninterest towards common goals, producing agreements \r\non global challenges, such as climate change and \r\nproliferation, and increasing inclusive economic \r\ngrowth. We see that cooperation here today at the \r\nUnited Nations, as we also saw it at the Commonwealth \r\nHeads of Government meeting earlier this year. And \r\nhere today, as Chair-in-Office of the Commonwealth, \r\nI deliver a clear statement on behalf of the Heads of \r\nGovernment of its 53 equal and independent member \r\nStates. We reaffirm our shared commitment to working \r\ntogether within a rules-based international system to \r\naddress shared global challenges and foster a fairer, \r\nmore secure, more sustainable and more prosperous \r\nfuture. That commitment takes account of the special \r\nrequirements of the least developed countries and of \r\nsmall and otherwise vulnerable economies and benefits \r\nall our citizens and the wider world.\r\nBut it is not enough for us merely to make the case \r\nfor cooperation. We need action, at home and in the \r\ncommunity of nations, to show how our ideas and values \r\ncan deliver practical benefits for all our people in all \r\nparts of the world. We must recognize the legitimacy \r\nof people’s concerns and act to build a global economy \r\nthat works for everyone. We must invest in the patient \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n46/52 18-29871\r\nwork of building open societies in which everyone has \r\na stake in the future. And we must act to uphold the \r\ninternational rules-based system and stand up for our \r\nvalues by protecting those who may suffer when it is \r\nviolated. Let me take each in turn.\r\nFirst, we must respond to those who feel that the \r\nglobal economy is not working for them; the pace of \r\nglobalization that has left too many people behind; the \r\nfear that our children and grandchildren may lack the \r\neducation and skills to secure the jobs of tomorrow; \r\nand the risk that technological change could become \r\na source of inequality and division rather than the \r\ngreatest opportunity in history. In the United Kingdom \r\nwe are driving investment in industries of the future \r\nto create new jobs, from low-carbon technologies to \r\nartificial intelligence. We are investing in education and \r\nskills so that workers are ready to make the most of the \r\nopportunities that lie ahead. And we are making sure \r\npeople play by the rules so that business and innovation \r\nis celebrated for creating jobs, not demonized because \r\nof grievances over tax not paid or rights not respected.\r\nWhile we strive to make our own economies work \r\nfor all our people, we should do the same at a global level. \r\nIn an increasingly global economy, it is not enough to \r\nensure people play by the rules at home. We need global \r\ncooperation to set and enforce fair rules on trade, tax \r\nand the sharing of data. And those rules need to keep \r\npace with the changing nature of trade and technology. \r\nWe need to give the World Trade Organization a broad, \r\nambitious and urgent mandate to reform. It must address \r\nthe areas where it is not functioning effectively, deal \r\nwith issues that are not currently covered and maintain \r\ntrust in a system that is critical to preventing a return to \r\nthe failed protectionism of the past.\r\nFair and respected rules are essential for business to \r\nf lourish and drive growth. But recent history shows that \r\nthat cannot be sustained without deeper partnerships \r\namong Governments, business, international financial \r\ninstitutions and civil society to ensure that growth \r\ndelivers for everyone. That is why I recently visited \r\nAfrica, along with British businesses, to promote trade \r\nand investment and encourage a new partnership based \r\non shared prosperity and shared security. It is why at \r\nthis General Assembly session I co-hosted an event \r\nwith Prime Minister Trudeau, President Kagame and \r\nPresident Akufo-Addo, calling for more support for \r\ninvestment and job creation for young people on the \r\ncontinent. It is why the United Kingdom will maintain \r\nits commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income on official development assistance \r\nand put our development budget at the heart of our \r\ninternational agenda. We will do more to create jobs, \r\nimprove skills and increase investment in emerging \r\neconomies — in both our interests and theirs, for the \r\nbest way of resisting protectionism is to ensure that this \r\ncentury is defined by open markets that really deliver \r\nfor all our people.\r\nSecondly, we must build countries, not only \r\neconomies, that work for everyone: inclusive societies \r\nwhere every citizen has a stake in the future. Those are \r\nthe firm foundations on which strong and accountable \r\nnations are built. History has consistently taught us that \r\ngiving people a stake in society is the best way to ensure \r\nstability, security and economic growth. There is no one \r\nright way to do this. Every country must choose its own \r\npath, but the basic tenets are common across the world. \r\nThey include a Government that is transparent and \r\naccountable, an independent judiciary to enforce the \r\nrule of law, free and fair elections and a free and open \r\nmedia. They also include freedom of expression, a right \r\nto redress, property rights that are reliably enforced, \r\nequality, freedom of thought, opinion, religion and \r\nconscience — all found in the United Nations Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, signed 70 years ago.\r\nThose of us who believe in those tenets must set \r\nan example in defending and strengthening them at \r\nhome and abroad. That is why we must call out hate \r\nspeech, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and all forms \r\nof prejudice and discrimination against minorities \r\nwherever we find it. Like many leaders, I suspect, \r\nI do not always enjoy reading what the media in my \r\ncountry writes about me. But I will defend their right to \r\nsay it, for the independence of our media is one of my \r\ncountry’s greatest achievements and it is the bedrock of \r\nour democracy.\r\nSo, too, will I defend objectivity and impartiality \r\nin the face of those who treat truth as just another \r\nopinion to be manipulated. This challenge has only \r\nbecome more complex with the rise in social media and \r\nonline information. That is why we agreed at the Group \r\nof Seven (G-7) Summit in June to step up our efforts \r\nto respond to disinformation and why, together with \r\nour partners and with technology companies, we are \r\nleading efforts to reclaim the Internet from terrorists \r\nand others who would do us harm.\r\nJust as we must stand up for the values that we \r\nadhere to, so we must support countries and leaders who \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 47/52\r\nchoose to take the often difficult steps towards a more \r\ninclusive society. The United Kingdom will use all the \r\nlevers at its disposal to do so. Through our aid budget \r\nand commitment to the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, we will not only protect the most vulnerable, but \r\nalso bolster States under threat and help others sustain \r\ntheir progress. Through global campaigns, we will \r\nhelp countries to end scourges such as modern slavery \r\nand sexual violence in conflict, and we will mobilize \r\nwider support through our alliances and membership \r\nof multilateral organizations — not only the United \r\nNations, but also international financial institutions, \r\nthe G-7, the Group of 20 and NATO.\r\nJust as there is no single recipe for an inclusive \r\nsociety, so there is no single model for balancing the \r\ndemocratic demands of our public with the imperative \r\nto cooperate internationally. The vote by the British \r\npeople to leave the European Union (EU) was not a \r\nrejection of multilateralism or international cooperation; \r\nit was a clear demand for decisions and accountability \r\nto lie closer to home. I believe the role of leadership \r\nin these circumstances is clear: it is delivering on the \r\ndemocratic wishes of our people and international \r\ncooperation, working with allies and partners in pursuit \r\nof our shared values.\r\nThirdly, we must have the will and confidence to \r\nact when the fundamental rules that we live by are \r\nbroken. This is not about repeating the mistakes of the \r\npast by trying to impose democracy on other countries \r\nthrough regime change, but we should not allow those \r\nmistakes to prevent us from protecting people in the \r\nface of the worst violations of human rights and human \r\ndignity. We should not allow those mistakes to paralyse \r\nthe international community when its long-established \r\nnorms are violated. We should not let our inability to \r\nprevent some of the worst conflicts today stop us from \r\nmaking every effort to ensure they do not happen again \r\nin future. If we stand back, we allow the world to become \r\ndivided into spheres of influence in which the powerful \r\ndominate the weak and in which legitimate grievances \r\ngo unaddressed. This is not just a moral imperative — it \r\nis also a matter of self-interest, for when barbarous acts \r\nand aggression go unchecked, dictators and terrorists \r\nare emboldened.\r\nWe must therefore have the confidence to act. When \r\nthe Syrian regime used chemical weapons on its people \r\nagain in April, it was Britain — together with France \r\nand America — that took military action to degrade \r\nthe Syrian regime’s chemical-weapons capability and \r\ndeter their use. Earlier this year, when Russia used a \r\ntoxic nerve agent in a sickening attack on the streets \r\nof Salisbury, the United Kingdom, with our NATO, \r\nEU and other allies, took action, expelling over 150 \r\nRussian intelligence officers in the largest collective \r\nexpulsion ever.\r\nIn Burma, following the damning report of the \r\nIndependent International Fact-Finding Mission on \r\nMyanmar, we should sow the same confidence to \r\nhold accountable those responsible for the appalling \r\natrocities repeatedly inflicted by the Burmese military \r\non the Rohingya, Shan and Kachin peoples since 2011. \r\nSimilarly, we should gather evidence of Da’esh’s crimes \r\nworldwide, show ensuring justice for their victims and \r\ndeterring those who might conduct such crimes in the \r\nfuture. But accountability alone is not enough. We must \r\ndo more collectively to prevent such atrocities in the \r\nfirst place and address the causes of instability that can \r\ngive rise to them.\r\nThe United Nations has a critical role to play, \r\nand it has a wide range of levers to do so, from \r\nsanctions — which show the leaders of Iran and North \r\nKorea that they cannot act without consequence — to \r\npeacekeeping missions, such as that in South Sudan, \r\nwhich is helping to prevent suffering and the collapse of \r\nlaw and order. To be able to effectively use those levers, \r\nthe Security Council must find the political will to \r\nact in our collective interest. United Nations agencies \r\nmust deliver the reforms that the Secretary-General \r\nhas started to become more agile, more transparent \r\nand better coordinated on the ground. To support those \r\nreforms, we must also ensure proper funding is targeted \r\nspecifically at those parts of the United Nations that \r\ndeliver results.\r\nSeventy years ago, the General Assembly agreed \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Today \r\nwe must renew the ideals and values on which that \r\nDeclaration was founded. In doing so, we must learn \r\nthe lessons of the past and show through our actions \r\nhow cooperation between strong and accountable \r\nStates with open economies and inclusive societies can \r\nbest deliver security and prosperity for all our people. \r\nAs Kofi Annan said at the start of his second term as \r\nSecretary-General,\r\n“I have sought to turn an unflinching eye to the \r\nfailures of our recent past, in order to assess more \r\nclearly what it will take for us to succeed in the \r\nfuture.” (A/55/PV.105, p.3)\r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n48/52 18-29871\r\nIn that spirit, let us show unflinching resolve to renew \r\nthe promise of freedom, opportunity and fairness, a \r\npromise that has delivered for more people, in more \r\nplaces, than at any other period in our history. Let us \r\nensure that promise can be fulfilled for our children \r\nand grandchildren and for every generation to come.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland for the statement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdullah Abdullah, \r\nChief Executive of the Islamic Republic of \r\nAfghanistan\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Chief \r\nExecutive of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chief Executive of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Abdullah \r\nAbdullah, Chief Executive of the Islamic Republic of \r\nAfghanistan, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Abdullah (Afghanistan): Allow me to start by \r\nextending my congratulations to Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés and wishing much success to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session. Let me also assure her that, by working \r\nwith Member States and the United Nations family, we \r\nlook forward to advancing the seven priorities set out \r\nin the agenda of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nthird session.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to provide the \r\nGeneral Assembly with the latest regarding the situation \r\nin Afghanistan and the gains, opportunities and \r\nchallenges that my nation faces at this critical juncture, \r\nin addition to our views on other key global challenges.\r\nThe record of accomplishments by this institution \r\nover the past 73 years demonstrates that, wherever \r\nit might be and whoever it might impact, we cannot \r\nescape the ripple effect of, or de-link ourselves from, \r\nthe global, national, communal and human connections \r\nthat bind us, whether in relation to the environment, \r\nthe climate, international finance or even the cyber and \r\ntechnology arenas. It is therefore critically important \r\nto go beyond just words, the duplication of effort or \r\nineffective models that intermingle and, at times, spur \r\ncountervailing or lopsided interests.\r\nAs Albert Einstein once said, “We cannot solve our \r\nproblems with the same level of thinking that created \r\nthem”. Whether we are addressing hunger, acute \r\npoverty, climate change, overpopulation, terrorism, \r\nconflict, displacement, inequality or organized crime, \r\nwe all share and own bits and pieces of the problem \r\nin the same way that we collectively benefit or learn \r\nfrom the solutions. As a result, we need to explore \r\nnew means and identify new tools for reaching a wider \r\nconsensus through more thoughtful dialogue and \r\nresults-oriented actions.\r\nTo this day we do not have a globally and officially \r\nacceptable definition for terrorism, a nefarious \r\nphenomenon used by a rogue or politically connected \r\ncriminal, State or non-State actor using religious, \r\nideological, economic or psychological cover to disrupt \r\nthe status quo, upend the global and nation State order \r\nand reach a particular set of radical goals through the \r\nsheer use of indiscriminate violence that no religion in \r\nits undistorted form condones.\r\nWhile we are determined to fight with vigour \r\nagainst newer versions of terror presenting themselves as \r\nremnants of Da’esh in a few pockets inside Afghanistan, \r\nwe are still struggling to fully comprehend the role that \r\nterror breeding grounds, sanctuaries and funding pools, \r\nin many cases tied to criminal and illicit drug networks, \r\nplay in the use and spread of terrorism. We are still \r\ntrying to figure out how to render terrorism impotent as \r\na policy tool used by some to further specific agendas.\r\nFor example, for almost a quarter of a century, \r\nAfghanistan experienced the loss of tens of thousands \r\nof innocent lives and major infrastructural damage. It is \r\npartly due to geography and partly due to shortsighted \r\nstrategies and regional agendas that have generated an \r\numbilical reliance on non-State actors, used to keep \r\nothers unstable through violence and the promotion \r\nof extremism. It has resulted in complacency and \r\nimpunity; therefore, we need to do more and go \r\nbeyond ineffective norms to bring about change and \r\naccountability. We have asked our neighbouring States, \r\nespecially Pakistan, to help targeted societies, including \r\ntheir own, to deal with this menace. We are looking \r\nforward to the timely and effective implementation of \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 49/52\r\nthe recently agreed Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan \r\nfor Peace and Solidarity.\r\nAll stakeholders need to agree to treat all shades of \r\nterrorism as one, shut down the breeding grounds and \r\nsanctuaries and prosecute or repatriate the violators. \r\nThe response thus far has been sparse and insufficient. \r\nWe are working with all countries, near and far, to bring \r\nabout better results. On that basis, Afghanistan stands \r\nfor the balanced implementation of all four pillars of \r\nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, \r\nand non-compliance must be seriously addressed as \r\nwell. My country has also begun a process of structured \r\ncooperation with the United Nations Office of Counter-\r\nTerrorism, and we are supportive of regional initiatives \r\nthrough forums that focus on such priority concerns. \r\nWe will continue to engage in work with regional \r\nstakeholders in that regard.\r\nSince we last met, Afghanistan turned a page and \r\nmade unprecedented overtures to the Taliban to be \r\npart of a credible, Afghan-owned, Afghan-led peace \r\nprocess that could lead to a just and comprehensive \r\npolitical settlement through talks and reconciliation. \r\nOn several occasions, we have pledged our commitment \r\nto unconditional intra-Afghan dialogue and the \r\nrestoration of all rights and privileges for those who \r\nagree to end the cycle of violence. We even announced \r\na unilateral ceasefire earlier this year, which was \r\nagreed to by the Taliban for a three-day period and gave \r\nAfghans a glimpse of what peace can look and feel like. \r\nUnfortunately, extraneous agendas prevented us from \r\nreplicating a second ceasefire more recently, but we \r\nwill not rest. We will have to pursue both what is right \r\nand attainable.\r\nI want to express my sincere thanks to all nations, \r\nespecially the United States, other concerned nations \r\nand parties — including the Governments of the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and of Indonesia, both of \r\nwhich recently hosted United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) gatherings — the \r\nUnited Nations and others for encouraging all sides \r\nto set the stage for a process that would lead to talks \r\nand a just and comprehensive negotiated settlement. \r\nLooking at the 25-year record, a prerequisite for talks is \r\nto learn from the history of peace engagement. We see \r\nthat a dual approach is necessary to make sure that we \r\nwin peace, but also protect and preserve our people’s \r\ngains and hard-earned achievements, which include \r\nconstitutional order, freedom of expression, human and \r\ngender rights and creating economic opportunities.\r\nI want to pause here and pay tribute to Afghans who \r\ncontinue to suffer as a result of violence, as well as to \r\nour valiant National Security Forces for their steadfast \r\ndefence of our nation and for standing tall and strong on \r\nthe front line against terrorism.\r\nThere are two important popular tests on the \r\nhorizon for Afghanistan: parliamentary elections \r\nare slated for next month and presidential elections \r\nfor next year. Drawing on past experiences, both \r\nPresident Ashraf Ghani and I agree that political \r\nlegitimacy is derived from the will of the people. While \r\nwe pursue peace efforts and deal with security and \r\ngovernance challenges, we are reminded that, given our \r\ncircumstances, eventually we must make sure that the \r\nelectoral process is trustworthy and that the electorate \r\ncan agree to a fairly credible and legitimate outcome.\r\nRegardless of who wins or loses, Afghanistan’s future \r\nrests on nurturing a national consensus that provides \r\nunity of purpose aimed at peace and political stability \r\nthat derives legitimacy from foundations that are \r\npluralistic, inclusive and democratic.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nIn that regard, I wish to thank the United \r\nNations — UNAMA in particular — the European \r\nUnion and all other contributors and donors for helping \r\nus move the process forward. Furthermore, we look \r\nforward to the upcoming Geneva ministerial conference \r\non Afghanistan in November. It will be an excellent \r\noccasion to evaluate our work and the path ahead since \r\nwe last met with donors.\r\nOn the humanitarian front, Afghanistan also faces \r\ndaunting tasks associated with an impending drought, \r\nrefugee resettlement and internal displacement caused \r\nby climatic and national abnormalities, food insecurity \r\nand security threats. Those are estimated to impact two \r\nthirds of the country and the livelihoods of more than \r\n4 million people, with the potential to force 1 million \r\nmore into migration. We sorely need to attend to their \r\nhumanitarian needs. I want to thank the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, other United \r\nNations agencies, non-governmental organizations and \r\ndonors for their contributions and hard work on the \r\ngroun; however, we urge the international community \r\nto fully fund the 2018-2021 Afghanistan humanitarian \r\nresponse plan.\r\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes and the \r\nprotection of oppressed people are core principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, benefiting the promotion \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n50/52 18-29871\r\nand preservation of international peace and security. \r\nAs a war-ravaged country, we sympathize with and feel \r\nfor the people of Syria, Yemen and other victimized \r\ncommunities around the world. Likewise, we stand for \r\nthe basic right to protection for the Rohingya population \r\nin Myanmar. Afghanistan stands in full support of \r\nall United Nations and other international efforts \r\naimed at achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting \r\nsettlement to the question of Palestine, including the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s call for an international protection \r\nmechanism for civilians.\r\nMoreover, United Nations peacebuilding activities \r\nshould provide due focus on the principle of national \r\nownership, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the promotion of greater \r\ncoherence among the relevant United Nations entities \r\nand agencies working on development.\r\nWith regard to the reform agenda, we stand in full \r\nsupport of efforts aimed at strengthening the role of the \r\nUnited Nations in the context of the Secretary-General’s \r\ninitiatives. The establishment of the Department of \r\nPolitical and Peacebuilding Affairs is a welcome \r\nmove, as is the setting up of the Office of Counter-\r\nTerrorism. We look forward to the implementation \r\nof the resolution adopted on the repositioning of the \r\nUnited Nations development system and believe it will \r\nenhance our achievements in the establishment of One \r\nUN for Afghanistan.\r\nAfghanistan’s active role within the United Nations \r\nsystem is currently more pronounced than ever. Our \r\nchairmanship of the Third Committee during the seventy-\r\nthird session comes at a crucial time, as we have aimed \r\nto initiate and adopt several draft resolutions on shared \r\nthemes, including victims of terrorism and the threat \r\nof improvised explosive devices, in addition to refugee \r\nand migrant issues, the rights of children, women’s \r\nempowerment, human rights, social development and \r\nother relevant Committee agenda items.\r\nFurthermore, Afghanistan’s election to the Human \r\nRights Council for the first time in 2017 marked our \r\ncommitment and showcased our achievements in that \r\nregard. We remain party to major international protocols \r\nand conventions on human rights. I am pleased to \r\ninform the Assembly that Afghanistan recently passed \r\na set of national laws on prohibiting cruel and degrading \r\ntreatment, endorsed the law on prohibiting torture and \r\ncombating human and migrant trafficking and adopted \r\na code prohibiting child recruitment into our security \r\nforces. With regard to the latter, we are working closely \r\nwith the Office of the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict.\r\nI want to leave this rostrum by presenting a bold \r\nconcept, also recently mentioned by President Ghani, \r\nthat can form a new, visionary paradigm for my country \r\nand our region as we strive to end four decades of conflict \r\nand enter a new phase free of violence and the forced \r\nimplementation of stagnant ideas and spoiler habits. \r\nIt is a concept that dwells on Afghanistan becoming \r\na platform of cordiality for regional and hemispheric \r\ncooperation over the next few years, in sharp contrast \r\nto being pushed and pulled towards becoming an area \r\nof instability and confrontation.\r\nOur people, who pose no danger to anyone, are \r\ndemanding a fundamental change in which they can play \r\na constructive and collaborative role across boundaries \r\nand help turn their country into a roundabout of people, \r\ngoods, services, communications, cooperation and \r\nideas across the wider region. I believe that, with the \r\nhelp of the international community, we can turn this \r\nconcept into a reality. I hope to further engage our \r\nregional partners in helping us bring this vision to \r\nfruition. I hope that the Assembly and all concerned \r\nMember States will play a supportive and positive role \r\nto put an end to years of agony and open up a new path \r\nleading to durable peace, stability and prosperity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the the Chief Executive of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chief Executive of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Giuseppe Conte, President of the \r\nCouncil of Ministers of the Italian Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Council of Ministers of \r\nthe Italian Republic.\r\nMr. Giuseppe Conte, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Italian Republic, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Giuseppe Conte, President of \r\nthe Council of Ministers of the Italian Republic, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.8\r\n18-29871 51/52\r\nMr. Conte (Italy) (spoke in Italian; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I am honoured \r\nto take the f loor today before the General Assembly, \r\nas the spokesperson for the will of the Government \r\nand the people, to confirm our commitment alongside, \r\nand in favour of, the United Nations. The international \r\ncommunity needs a truly effective multilateralism and \r\na United Nations that is strengthened in its role as a \r\npillar of an international system based on peace, justice \r\nand equity. We therefore continue to support the reform \r\nplan of the Secretary-General, now more so than ever \r\nin the delicate implementation process that awaits him. \r\nWe want a United Nations that is closer to the people, \r\nthat is able to respond to their security and well-being \r\nneeds and that is ready to protect them from the pitfalls \r\nof globalization, which offers many opportunities but \r\ncan also produce errant effects.\r\nThe Italian Government has made those same \r\npriorities the basis of its action. Government action \r\nthat does not give due consideration to ensuring that all \r\nof its citizens have equitable and fully dignified living \r\nconditions is not action that I can consider morally, \r\nmuch less politically, acceptable. When some accuse us \r\nof souverainism or populism, I always enjoy pointing \r\nout that article 1 of the Italian Constitution cites \r\nsovereignty and the people. It is precisely through that \r\nprovision that I interpret the concept of sovereignty and \r\nthe exercise of sovereignty by the people. That approach \r\ndoes not modify the traditional position of Italy within \r\nthe international community and, consequently, \r\ntowards the United Nations. Security, the defence of \r\npeace and the values that best preserve it, as well as the \r\npromotion of development and human rights, are goals \r\nthat we share and shall continue to pursue with courage \r\nand conviction at the national and international levels.\r\nOn the seventieth anniversary of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, Italy expresses that \r\nwill through its candidature to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. Respect for the inviolable rights of humankind \r\nis one of the pillars on which the Italian Republic is \r\nfounded — our beacon, especially today, when we are \r\ncalled upon to address the immense challenges of the \r\ngrave and prolonged crises in the Euro-Mediterranean \r\narea, including migratory f lows. For years, Italy has \r\nbeen engaged in search-and-rescue missions in the \r\nMediterranean Sea and has saved tens of thousands \r\nof people from death, often single-handedly, as has \r\nfrequently been acknowledged by those who say that \r\nItaly has saved the honour of Europe.\r\nThe migratory phenomena we are facing require \r\nshort-, medium-, and long-term responses from the \r\nentire international community that are structured \r\nand multi-level. It is on that basis that we support the \r\nglobal compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. \r\nThis is a challenge that can, and must, be met through \r\nan approach of shared responsibility, in a logic of \r\npartnership between the countries of origin, transit and \r\ndestination of the f lows, while taking into account the \r\npriority need to guarantee the dignity of the individual, \r\nbut also the firm determination to fight those who \r\ntrample on that dignity and on life itself through \r\nhuman trafficking.\r\nItaly pursues the goals of international peace and \r\nsecurity including during times of budgetary constraints. \r\nWe are solidly in eighth position as a contributor \r\nto the regular budget of the United Nations, and we \r\nsupplement that commitment through development \r\ninitiatives, both at the bilateral level and through \r\nUnited Nations agencies. Those initiatives are inspired \r\nby the Sustainable Development Goals inscribed in the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Poverty, \r\ninequality, unemployment and the devastating effects \r\nof climate change are ills that concern every country, \r\nindependently of their level of development.\r\nThe logic of assistance must give way to a \r\nframework of mutual responsibility and partnership, \r\nas promoted by Italy — for example, on the African \r\ncontinent — so that each stakeholder can do their part \r\nto the best of their possibilities and abilities.\r\nItaly is proud to be one of the main contributors \r\nto peacekeeping operations, a commitment we have \r\nmaintained for many years and for which we have \r\nreceived the appreciation, essential to us, that comes \r\nfirst and foremost from the local communities in which \r\nwe are operating.\r\nItaly is a country whose very DNA contains the \r\npromotion of dialogue and inclusiveness in crisis \r\nsituations. Those principles are essential when \r\naddressing the grave and widespread situations of \r\ninstability that today characterize an area that is vital \r\nto the security and prosperity of Italy and Europe as a \r\nwhole, namely, the greater Mediterranean.\r\nIn the upcoming weeks Italy will host a conference \r\non Libya, the main goal of which will be to support \r\na shared political path and contribute to the country’s \r\npolitical stabilization. That path will foster the broadest \r\npossible involvement of Libyan stakeholders, who \r\nA/73/PV.8 26/09/2018\r\n52/52 18-29871\r\nremain the masters of their destiny. The United Nations \r\nwill play a central role through the action plan, on \r\nwhich all the contributions of the main international \r\nand regional stakeholders will converge.\r\nThe long conflict that has roiled Syria for seven \r\nyears demonstrates all the limits of military solutions. \r\nWe have the duty to support the action of the United \r\nNations and of Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Staffan De Mistura.\r\nShared responsibility — in the framework of building \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies — is a call \r\nthat we share and accept as an invitation to change. \r\nThe same spirit of change characterizes the action of \r\nthe Government that I lead. But we must also assume \r\nthat responsibility towards the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, in which Italy will continue to pursue its deep \r\ncommitment, in dialogue with all Member States, to \r\nachieve the goal of a shared reform.\r\nWe should all aspire to the path to effective \r\nmultilateralism. Nevertheless, that path cannot \r\ndisregard the need for every member of the human \r\nfamily to recognize in the United Nations true global \r\nleadership, to which they look with renewed faith.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Council \r\nof Ministers of the Italian Republic for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Giuseppe Conte, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Italian Republic, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3 p.m.\r\n"
