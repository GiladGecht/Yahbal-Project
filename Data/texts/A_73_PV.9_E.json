"United Nations A/73/PV.9\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-third session\r\n9th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 26 September 2018, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Ms. Espinosa Garcés. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Ecuador)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jorge Carlos De Almeida Fonseca, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cabo Verde\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Cabo Verde.\r\nMr. Jorge Carlos De Almeida Fonseca, President \r\nof the Republic of Cabo Verde, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jorge Carlos De Almeida Fonseca, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cabo Verde, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Fonseca (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I would like to \r\ncongratulate you, Madam President, on your election, \r\nand wish you great success as you embark on your noble \r\nand challenging mission. I also wish to congratulate \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák, of the Republic of Slovakia, the \r\noutgoing President of the General Assembly, for his \r\nexcellent work during his term.\r\nNext, I would like to express my utmost appreciation \r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, for his \r\nsmart and competent stewardship of our common house, \r\nand to reaffirm our full trust and profound respect for his \r\nleadership, particularly amid the many difficulties that \r\nthe world currently faces. I am referring, for example, \r\nto terrorism, which is spreading in many countries; the \r\nmigration crisis, particularly on the African continent, \r\nfrom where we get news, virtually every day, of young \r\npeople, children and women who have abandoned their \r\nhomes out of desperation and ventured into the world in \r\nsearch of a better life only to face subhuman conditions; \r\nthe impact of climate change on human security; \r\nconflicts and other threats to peace coming to us from \r\nall quarters of the world; and the glaring situation of \r\npoverty, which continues to be a reality that puts our \r\nglobal capacity to leave no one behind to the test.\r\nIn order to mitigate those and other problems that \r\nall of us present here in this Assembly face, the United \r\nNations has worked tirelessly under the leadership of \r\nour Secretary-General, to whom I would like to express, \r\nonce again, our profound gratitude. To address those \r\nproblems, the President of the General Assembly could \r\nnot have proposed a more appropriate theme for her \r\npresidency than “Making the United Nations relevant \r\nto all people”, while also promoting multilateralism, \r\nwhich I define here as combining efforts and taking a \r\npath to global leadership and shared responsibilities in \r\norder to build the peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties that we all desire.\r\nWe will celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December. \r\nHowever, hate, discrimination and violence are still \r\nalive and present. As the Director-General of UNESCO \r\nhas stated:\r\n“Hundreds of millions of women and men are \r\ndestitute, deprived of basic livelihoods and \r\nopportunities. Forced population movements are \r\nviolating rights on an unprecedented scale.

The fact that universal standards and \r\nprinciples of human rights are integral to the legal \r\norder of many countries is a major advancement for \r\nhumankind. However, that does not mean that such \r\nstandards and principles are fully and effectively \r\naccepted. In fact, human rights achievements translate \r\ninto a framework of rights that combine with cultural or \r\nhistorical conditions to weave a non-linear history that \r\nis at times contradictory but always open and never-\r\nending.\r\nRespect for the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights therefore constitutes an unquestionably noble \r\ngoal and, at the same time, remains one of the greatest \r\nchallenges of our time. Although the struggle for its \r\neffectiveness is intensifying, violations have virtually \r\nbeen institutionalized in many parts of the world. Such \r\nviolations have also been observed in situations of war, \r\nwhich unfortunately aff licts many parts of the world, \r\nespecially Africa, taking on unacceptable dimensions \r\nthrough increasingly common practices such as human \r\ntrafficking, including the trafficking of children, \r\norganized transnational crime and acts of genocide \r\nand other war crimes. Despite those unfavourable \r\nconditions, we raise the banner of hope and fight to \r\ndefend and promote fundamental human rights, driven, \r\nabove all, by our faith in the capacity of humankind \r\nto creatively mould reality to our will, notwithstanding \r\ncausalities and constraints.\r\nOur country’s choice to pursue a policy of peace, \r\ndialogue and understanding to prevent and resolve \r\nconflicts acknowledges and reflects those values. \r\nFurthermore, it emanates from the very nature of the \r\nCabo Verdean people — from the culture of tolerance \r\nthat has allowed our policies to be shaped by such values \r\nand principles over four decades of history as a sovereign \r\nnation. In our day-to-day lives, we have demonstrated \r\nthat tolerance is possible and that the sharing of values \r\nis a reality, even in the face of adversity.\r\nWe profoundly regret to see that the death penalty \r\nstill exists in many countries around the world. The \r\nexistence of the death penalty in the twenty-first \r\ncentury demands profound, careful and responsible \r\nreflection from all of us. It is a fact that the search \r\nfor a new universal conscience will lead us to rethink \r\nour understanding of the purposes and motivations \r\nbehind human coexistence, but they should always be \r\nbased on respect for life and the immanent dignity of \r\nhuman beings.\r\nThe Constitution and justice system of Cabo Verde \r\ndo not provide for life sentences or the death penalty. \r\nIn fact, the death penalty has not been applied in our \r\ncountry since before the last quarter of the nineteenth \r\ncentury. Our unique historical and social condition \r\nhas instilled in us cultural principles and values that \r\npromote the right to life under all circumstances. In \r\nthat regard, we wish to reiterate our absolute support \r\nfor the recent appeal by Pope Francis to the conscience \r\nof State authorities around the world to seek an \r\ninternational consensus on the abolition of the death \r\npenalty. In addition to calling for the unequivocal, firm \r\nand exemplary repudiation of capital punishment, Pope \r\nFrancis also spoke against the so-called extrajudicial \r\nexecutions, or illegal killings that are being committed.\r\nIn the name of clemency and prudence, we firmly \r\nbelieve that capital punishment is not an appropriate and \r\nfair instrument, nor is it efficient in achieving justice, \r\nin the light of its insurmountable conditionalities and \r\nweaknesses. As a superior value, life cannot be left at \r\nthe mercy of presumably fallible judges, who, unaware \r\nof the laws of clemency, imprudently insist on donning \r\nthe soiled robe of the executioner, succumbing to the \r\ndim light cast by a law that, in terms of relative values, \r\nis certainly not above the value of life and the ethics \r\nthat it embodies.\r\nMoreover, we also believe that, based on an \r\nunwavering and optimistic anthropology, human beings \r\ncan be rehabilitated and that, in the modern world, there \r\nexist institutional conditions and less grievous forms \r\nof punishment that are still suitable and effective and \r\nwhich avoid the shameful radical solution of ending the \r\nlife of a fellow human being. Viewing criminal justice \r\nin the context of the rule of law, capital punishment is \r\ntherefore unjustifiable. It is along those lines that we \r\nfully subscribe to the plea by the Holy Father Pope \r\nFrancis for a universal moratorium on executions.\r\nThrough the 43 years of its independence, Cabo \r\nVerde, a small island State with major shortages of \r\nresources, is proud to be a democratic country built on \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 3/62\r\nthe rule of law through the sacrifice and determination \r\nof Cabo Verdeans residing in the country and abroad. \r\nI believe that my country can contribute, even if \r\nmodestly, to the quest for solutions to major problems \r\nthat currently aff lict our troubled world. More than a \r\nmodel of the political stability that characterizes our \r\ncountry or of the democratic regime that we have built \r\nand consolidated, the nation of Cabo Verde, which \r\npredates the creation of the Cabo Verdean State, may \r\nbe considered an example of peaceful coexistence \r\namong people from different countries and with \r\ndifferent beliefs who have been blended into a unique \r\nand diverse culture that is open to the world and to the \r\nsharing of values.\r\nWithout any pretence or false modesty, I am also \r\nproud of our country’s journey from independence \r\nto the present day. In fact, I can say that, according \r\nto the human, economic and financial indices, our \r\ncountry’s achievements have been favourably received \r\nby major international institutions, particularly \r\nthose in the financial arena. However, with our \r\ncountry’s service-based economy, its very small \r\nmarket and an agricultural sector that is struggling \r\nagainst desertification and scarce rainfall, we cannot \r\nignore our significant vulnerabilities, and we note \r\nthat we must not rest because we have graduated to \r\nmiddle-income-country status. Indeed, we believe that \r\nwe must not lose sight of the fact that our economy \r\ncontinues to be very dependent and that it cannot \r\nabsorb a large number of our workers, with all the social \r\neffects that that entails, which is why we continue to \r\nrely on international solidarity. Naturally, we must also \r\nincrease our reliance on domestic resources, develop \r\nthrough public-private partnerships and become more \r\neffective in fighting extreme poverty, social exclusion \r\nand unemployment, particularly among young people, \r\nthereby promoting growth and development in \r\nCabo Verde.\r\nOur constraints with respect to energy, water, health \r\nand sanitation, to name just a few areas, will require \r\nour continued attention, and we will need to build the \r\nnecessary infrastructure to create the conditions for \r\nensuring our economy’s sustainable growth. Similarly, \r\nas we look to our future, we must also consider the \r\nincreasingly disastrous impacts that climate change \r\nand other natural disasters are having on the world, \r\nparticularly on small island developing States.\r\nCabo Verde graduated to a middle-income country \r\nin 2008, when the world was gripped by a major \r\ninternational financial crisis, which contributed to \r\nour missing the window of opportunity created by our \r\ngraduation. Since then, the structural vulnerabilities \r\naff licting our country have become not only aggravated \r\nbut also more complex. We see this situation in our \r\ngrowing regional asymmetries, which are exacerbated \r\nby the lack of territorial continuity that goes with \r\nbeing an island nation, the nefarious effects of drought, \r\ndesertification and other climate changes, as well as \r\nweak production capacity, unemployment of young \r\npeople, social and gender inequalities, the excessive \r\nburden of external debt on the budget, and the \r\ndifficulties in internally connecting our country by air \r\nand sea, which hampers the creation of a competitive \r\nand coherent market, which is essential for developing \r\ntourism. Such facts convince us of the relevance of \r\nand need for support measures that are distinct and \r\nadjusted to the realities of our country in the areas of \r\ndevelopment, trade and foreign debt.\r\nFinally, we call for more substantial inclusion of \r\nand a greater voice for developing countries within the \r\nUnited Nations system, the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development and other institutions in \r\nline with the work that is already being pursued. To \r\nthat end, in December 2018, the Government of Cabo \r\nVerde will convene a round table in Paris to make an \r\nappeal for the mobilization of innovative partnerships \r\nthat are consistent with our reality as a small island \r\ndeveloping State. Cabo Verde will want to hear what \r\nour development partners think of the relevance of \r\nour proposals and options, and to discuss forms of \r\ncooperation with them, in close coordination with our \r\nagreed national efforts, including the alignment of \r\nour national development plan with the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. We therefore count on the support \r\nof the members of the Assembly on Cabo Verde’s \r\njourney towards the sustainable development for which \r\nwe all strive.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Cabo Verde for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Jorge Carlos De Almeida Fonseca, President \r\nof the Republic of Cabo Verde, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n4/62 18-29877\r\nAddress by King Mswati III, Head of State of the \r\nKingdom of Eswatini\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Head of State of the Kingdom of Eswatini.\r\nKing Mswati III, Head of State of the Kingdom \r\nof Eswatini, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nMajesty King Mswati III, Head of State of the Kingdom \r\nof Eswatini, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nKing Mswati III: It is a great honour for me to \r\naddress the General Assembly at its seventy-third \r\nsession, where we have come to renew our commitment \r\nto creating an enabling environment for all humankind.\r\nThe theme of this session, “Making the United \r\nNations relevant to all people: global leadership \r\nand shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies”, has great resonance with \r\nresolution 72/279, adopted on 31 May, which aims at the \r\nrepositioning of the United Nations development system \r\nto better support countries in their achievement of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under strong \r\nnational leadership and with international cooperation.\r\nWhen the United Nations was established in 1945, \r\nits main purpose was to reduce tensions and avert \r\nanother conflict following the Second World War. Since \r\nthen, we have converged as a family at the General \r\nAssembly to renew this commitment and analyse how \r\nwe address challenges affecting the world. It is a time \r\nto assess whether we are still living up to the ethos of \r\nthe founders, who sought to ensure that the world would \r\nnever again endure another world war, but rather find \r\npeaceful solutions to resolving possible conflicts.\r\nWe are all aware of the pockets of tension existing \r\nin different regions of the world, which require that \r\nStates Members of the United Nations speak with one \r\nvoice when offering possible peaceful solutions. Since \r\na fragmented approach would render peaceful solutions \r\nelusive for affected countries, it is imperative that \r\nwe engage and resolve issues together as the United \r\nNations family in order to ensure that we end up with \r\nlasting solutions.\r\nWe appeal to the countries experiencing conflict \r\nsituations to come up with home-grown solutions to \r\naddress their differences. We urge these nations to \r\navoid the use of force in an attempt to impose change. \r\nWhere they do not see eye to eye, they need to adopt \r\ndialogue as the best way to find lasting solutions. \r\nWhere there is no loss of blood, unity prevails, whereas \r\nviolence begets instability.\r\nThose who have lost lives and property in conflicts \r\ndo not forget, and their bitterness makes nation-building \r\nefforts much harder to achieve. States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations are strongly urged to avoid fuelling \r\ntensions in troubled countries with a divided approach \r\nto intervention, as that defeats the purpose of the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations. Our approach \r\nshould always be, for the greater good of humankind, to \r\nsearch for and find an amicable way forward to address \r\nall the challenges we face.\r\nAnother great concern is the imbalance between \r\nrich and poor, which continues to deepen by the day \r\ndespite our efforts to implement the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, which were designed to bridge \r\nthat divide. As the United Nations family, we need \r\nto pay serious attention to those imbalances, as they \r\ncontribute to terrorism and social strife in the world.\r\nThe African Union has also set out to improve lives \r\nwith the goal of realizing a well-developed Africa for \r\nall by 2063. It is important to support such programmes, \r\nwhich are similar to initiatives undertaken in other \r\nregions of the world, some of which have shown great \r\nprogress in that regard. We urge successful blocs \r\nto meaningfully support developing countries that \r\nhave adopted good programmes to transform their \r\neconomies but lack the means to do so. The slow process \r\nof development in such countries adds to the burden \r\nresulting from their failure to provide for the needs \r\nof our people and our society. We need to find ways \r\nand solutions to speed up the process of developing \r\nsustainable economies by removing the stumbling \r\nblocks to development, in line with the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nIt is perhaps time that we engage researchers to find \r\nout what developing countries need in order to fast-track \r\neconomic growth and identify high-turnover capital \r\nprojects that would be best suited to catalyse such an \r\nendeavour. No country deserves to go for a whole year \r\nwithout any investment. There are numerous successful \r\ncountries that can share their experiences of success. \r\nTheir insights could assist developing countries in \r\nensuring that no country is left behind as we strive to \r\nachieve our development objectives.\r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 5/62\r\nThe African continent remains challenged by \r\nvarious diseases, including Ebola, HIV/AIDS, malaria, \r\ntuberculosis and many others, each of which requires \r\nlarge amounts of funding if they are to be overcome. \r\nAfrica has resolved to eliminate those diseases in a \r\nshort amount of time. However, without funding, that \r\nwill remain a challenge. Some of those health issues \r\nrequire further analysis given that, in some cases where \r\nwe have had success, we subsequently had to deal with \r\ntheir re-emergence in a more virulent form.\r\nIt would be remiss of us not to thank and commend \r\nthe support lent by members of the United Nations \r\nfamily to countries in need, especially for health issues \r\nin Africa. We need to ensure that every citizen has access \r\nto basic services, such as clean water, health care and \r\nfree primary education. We commend those countries \r\nthat have reached the level of being able to provide \r\nfree education. It is only by investing in education that \r\nnations may produce the highly qualified citizenry that \r\nenables them to realize their full development potential.\r\nReducing unemployment is a global challenge, so \r\ntoo is caring for the elderly, a group that has contributed \r\nimmensely to the development of each country. They \r\ndeserve to be cared for once they have done their part. \r\nAddressing those issues is becoming increasingly \r\nchallenging given the decline in donor funding, which \r\nmeans more hardship for our people. We should \r\ntherefore seek alternative means of fundraising so as \r\nto avoid the undesirable situation in which people have \r\nto resort to self-help in order to cope with the global \r\nchallenges. Such an approach threatens peace, as it \r\ncould lead to the diversion of resources from efforts \r\nin place to address already existing challenges, such \r\nas diseases.\r\nIt is unfortunate that the African continent \r\ncontinues to attract more United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions than any other region in the world, which \r\nqualifies Africa for proper representation in the \r\npeace and security arena and makes it a key player \r\nin discussions on issues of peace and security in all \r\nstructures of the United Nations. We therefore make the \r\nappeal for Africa not to be left behind. Its voice must be \r\nheard and featured prominently and permanently at the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAs negotiations of reform of the Security Council \r\nprogress, the Kingdom of Eswatini calls for the \r\nfavourable consideration of the African common \r\nposition, as well as the support of those countries that \r\nare not members of the Security Council. Africa calls \r\nfor the allocation of no less than two permanent seats \r\non the Security Council, with all of the prerogatives \r\nand privileges of permanent membership — including \r\nthe veto power — and five non-permanent seats.\r\nWe remain confident that the SDGs and Agenda \r\n2063 of the African Union will continue to give \r\nus the proper guidance and impetus needed to \r\neradicate poverty and create inclusive and sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all. The Kingdom of Eswatini has \r\nmade significant strides in adapting the SDGs at \r\nthe local level and integrating them into its national \r\nplanning processes. We have finalized a review of \r\nour 1997-2022 national development strategy and will \r\nsoon be launching a revised national strategy with the \r\ntheme “Development strategy for Eswatini: promoting \r\nsustainable development and inclusive growth”. The \r\nstrategy is expected to accelerate the implementation \r\nof the SDGs in the Kingdom.\r\nIn a bid to facilitate research and development, the \r\nKingdom of Eswatini is fully committed to working \r\ntowards a knowledge-based economy through the \r\ndevelopment of science, technology and innovation \r\ninfrastructure. The Royal Science and Technology \r\nPark continues to be a key entity aimed at advancing \r\nresearch in the scientific and related fields. We would \r\nlike to express our profound gratitude to the friends of \r\nthe Kingdom who are supporting us in our endeavour \r\nto develop those fundamental initiatives. However, as \r\ninnovation, research and development are constantly \r\nevolving, such efforts are a work in progress. The \r\nKingdom therefore continues to seek additional support \r\nso as to further strengthen initiatives that contribute to \r\nattaining our national Vision 2022 and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nOnly a few days ago, the people of the Kingdom of \r\nEswatini held a very peaceful national election that was \r\nfree and fair. We are glad that international observers \r\nwere in attendance to monitor the elections and that their \r\nconclusions were in line with our expectations. During \r\nthe elections, the people nominated candidates in their \r\nchiefdoms to compete at the constituency level, using a \r\nsystem we call Tinkhundla. The system ensures direct \r\nparticipation and promotes participatory democracy \r\namong our people. It is home grown, part of our customs \r\nand traditions, and enshrined in our Constitution.\r\nWe fully support the participation of women in \r\npolitical decision-making positions and have recently \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n6/62 18-29877\r\nenacted the Election of Women Members to the House \r\nof Assembly Act in order to ensure their representation \r\nin Parliament. We have also successfully enacted the \r\nSexual Offences and Domestic Violence Act, a legal \r\nframework to protect women from domestic violence \r\nand sexual assault. That legislation will give effect to \r\nthe relevant international legal instruments, including, \r\ninter alia, the Convention on the Elimination of All \r\nForms of Discrimination against Women.\r\nWe are pleased to inform the General Assembly \r\nthat, earlier this year, our Kingdom celebrated 50 years \r\nof independence. We are grateful that the country has \r\nbeen able to champion its development agenda as a free \r\nnation for 50 years. During the celebration, the nation \r\ndecided to revert to its original name, Eswatini. Since \r\ntime immemorial, the name of the Kingdom has always \r\nbeen Eswatini.\r\nI would like to emphasize that the call of the United \r\nNations to leave no one behind requires identifying \r\nthem, knowing where they are and understanding \r\nhow they live, as well as determining how they can be \r\nassisted and brought to par with the rest of the world. \r\nAnswering those questions will go a long way towards \r\nmaking the United Nations more relevant to all peoples \r\nof the world.\r\nWe would like to draw the attention of the Assembly \r\nto the negative impact that being categorized as a \r\nmiddle-income country has had on our access to external \r\nresources. Our designation as a middle-income country \r\nhas come at a time when we need even more resources \r\nto be able to inject innovation into the development \r\nprogrammes that we have undertaken pursuant to the \r\nSDGs. We sincerely hope that the commendable reform \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General will help to support \r\nand strengthen our efforts aimed at gaining access to \r\nexternal resources and securing sustainable funding \r\nmechanisms so as to enable us to move towards fully \r\nrealizing the SDGs by 2030.\r\nMr. Barry (Burkina Faso), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe Kingdom of Eswatini reiterates its unwavering \r\nstance as it calls on the United Nations to afford \r\nthe people of the Republic of China, Taiwan, the \r\nopportunity to contribute to and partake in the United \r\nNations development system. Taiwan’s experience in \r\nfields that are vital to various dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment would go a long way towards contributing \r\nto the work and well-being of the membership of the \r\nUnited Nations. We wish to make a strong appeal for \r\nthe people of Taiwan not to be left behind, with a view \r\nto keeping the United Nations relevant to all people, in \r\nline with the spirit of universality.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to extend my \r\ncongratulations to the President of the General \r\nAssembly on her election to preside at the seventy-third \r\nsession of the Assembly. We commend the General \r\nAssembly for having such confidence in her as to \r\nchoose her to serve as only the fourth woman President \r\nof the General Assembly in its 73 years of existence. I \r\nwould like to assure her of my Kingdom’s full support \r\nas she executes her duties and responsibilities during \r\nher term of office. We further appreciate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and all his staff for their continued support \r\nand hard work to improve the working mechanisms \r\nand relevance of the United Nations system for all \r\nMember States. We hope to come out of this session \r\nwith meaningful goals that will chart a better future for \r\nour respective countries.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Head of \r\nState of the Kingdom of Eswatini for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nKing Mswati III, Head of State of the Kingdom \r\nof Eswatini, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Petro Poroshenko, President \r\nof Ukraine\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Ukraine.\r\nMr. Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Petro \r\nPoroshenko, President of Ukraine, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Poroshenko: On behalf of Ukraine, I \r\ncongratulate the President on her election to preside \r\nover the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. \r\nWe support the outlined priorities and are ready to do \r\nour part in translating them into reality.\r\nOur deliberations are taking place at a defining \r\nmoment for the United Nations. Despite the universal \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 7/62\r\nappeal for peace and a declared commitment to \r\nupholding it, wars and armed conflicts remain our reality. \r\nConflicts are the main reason for the increase in number \r\nof refugees and displaced persons worldwide — to the \r\nunprecedented figure of 65.5 million. Since no peace \r\nmeans no development, hundreds of millions are \r\ndoomed to misery.\r\nThe international security environment seemed \r\nrock solid less than two decades ago. It has now \r\ndescended into a volatile and increasingly disturbing \r\nstate of affairs, where both traditional and hybrid threats \r\nchallenge the stability of our societies. Too often, lofty \r\nrhetoric on peace, respect for international law and \r\ncommitment to human rights remains precisely that: \r\nrhetoric — nice sounding words and politically correct \r\nmessages that are not backed by concrete action.\r\nWe may be tempted to talk about achievements or \r\ngrand plans for the future, yet, from our perspective, \r\nit is much more important to address the fundamental \r\nproblems faced by the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community as a whole. We will never \r\nforget that the raison d’être of the Organization is to \r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\r\nUnfortunately, my fellow citizens have become \r\npart of that one fifth of the world population that \r\nis experiencing the horrors of war. As I deliver my \r\naddress, reports have brought the sad news of another \r\nhuman life lost on the front lines of a war that has been \r\ninflicted on my country by a permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council. Yesterday and the day before, several \r\nfamilies were again struck by grief as their loved ones \r\nperished as a result of Russia’s hostile attacks. Moscow \r\nturns Ukrainians into orphans, it tortures our patriots \r\nin its prisons, and more than 1.5 million people have \r\nbecome internally displaced persons who still cannot \r\nreturn to their homes.\r\nRussia continues to multiply the human tragedy, \r\nwhich recently took on a new dimension: ecological. It \r\nis poisoning Ukrainian soil and causing environmental \r\ndisasters, not only in occupied Crimea but also in \r\nthe Donbas region. That has been a daily reality for \r\nUkrainians for four years now: thousands of deaths, \r\ndestruction, displacement and human suffering. For \r\nmy fellow citizens, those years have been a tremendous \r\nchallenge and a test of their determination, solidarity, \r\nresilience and faith.\r\nLet us not forget what this war is about. Ukraine \r\nmade a sovereign decision to live on its own terms and \r\npromote a freer world based on democratic values and \r\nrules. Russia is punishing Ukraine for that decision. \r\nIt kills, destroys homes, and tells lies on a massive \r\nscale. It claims that Ukraine and Georgia have attacked \r\nthemselves. Do we know which one of Russia’s \r\nneighbours will be the next to attack itself, or will \r\ncountries around the world be comfortably numb in the \r\nhope that they will not be next?\r\nAs we defend Ukraine’s land and our freedom of \r\nchoice, and as we counter the resurgent neo-imperialist \r\nPower that is willing to divide the world anew, we are \r\nalso defending the free world. The United Nations \r\nshould not remain silent while the values and principles \r\nrooted in its Charter, as well as the entire body of \r\ninternational law, are being violated by a country with \r\nthe veto power. This is not just a challenge, but a chance \r\nto make the United Nations relevant and the motto of \r\nthis session of the General Assembly work.\r\nHow did such a deterioration in world affairs \r\ncome about? Many assume that respect for peace and \r\ninternational law is a constant given. Developments \r\non the international stage over the past decade have \r\nseriously undermined such confidence. Appeasement \r\nand quick fixes to difficult problems have proved \r\nto be false options. It has been proved that staying \r\ncomfortably silent when international norms are \r\nbreached does nothing but encourage the offender to \r\ncontinue its destructive policies. The world’s silence is \r\nexactly what the Kremlin weaponizes against Ukraine \r\nand, ultimately, against all of us.\r\nIt is naive to believe that safe shores will always be \r\nfound. There will be no safe shores if we allow someone \r\nto feel that he or she will not be bound by any norms \r\nor restrictions, that he or she has a right to reshape the \r\ninternational system to his or her liking, or that his \r\nor her interests are more legitimate than ours. In the \r\nabsence of a strong and united reaction, an extremely \r\nirresponsible and selfish actor resorts to the tactic of \r\nfurther escalation, which creates new crises, raises the \r\nstakes, and blackmails other countries and even entire \r\ninternational organizations — all in an effort to get \r\naway with murder. We shall not allow this to happen. \r\nWe will put the world back on track.\r\nWhat is the cure? In a word, it is responsibility. \r\nThe ability of the international community to ensure \r\nsystemic and unerring responsibility for each and every \r\nviolation of international law — including, first and \r\nforemost, the norms and principles of the Charter of \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n8/62 18-29877\r\nthe United Nations — is the benchmark measuring how \r\nsuccessful we as a family of nations can be in achieving \r\nour shared goals. Ensuring responsibility is never an \r\neasy feat. Let me be absolutely clear on the following \r\npoint: nothing will stop Moscow from continuing its \r\naggressive, expansionist policies if it does not face \r\na united stand by the international community and \r\npunishment for its actions does not become inevitable. \r\nIt is due to the lack of relevant punishment that after \r\nGeorgia came Ukraine, after Litvinenko came the \r\nSkripals and after Aleppo came Idlib.\r\nThe Kremlin has no intention of stopping. Following \r\nthe occupation of Crimea, it now aims to occupy the \r\nSea of Azov, situated between Ukraine and Russia, \r\nand, having illegally constructed a bridge across the \r\nKerch Strait, Russia launched its systematic disruption \r\nof Ukrainian and foreign ships and the freedom of \r\ninternational navigation through the Strait. Such brutal \r\nactions must be rejected as illegal, including under \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. \r\nThey require a strong response, including an enhanced \r\nsanctions policy and other targeted measures.\r\nThe efficiency of international actions often falls \r\nshort of expectations, and the relevance of the United \r\nNations itself is called into question. We must admit \r\nthat the responsibility for resolving the current state \r\nof affairs rests on all of us, both collectively and \r\nindividually. If we are committed to building peaceful, \r\nequitable and sustainable societies, we must protect the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, uphold its norms and \r\nprinciples and take resolute action to restore justice.\r\nLet me put it more precisely: the beautiful language \r\nof the Charter is worth nothing if it is not enforced. \r\nNo more words are needed; it is the time for deeds. \r\nThe United Nations must gain momentum, as there are \r\ncontinued attempts to ruin the rules-based international \r\norder and forcefully revise internationally recognized \r\nState borders. That dangerous slide towards a world \r\nwith no civilized rules must be stopped. In that regard, \r\nthere is a need to revitalize and strengthen the role of \r\nthe General Assembly in the area of international peace \r\nand security.\r\nWith conflicts spreading, we must ensure the \r\nmaximum flexibility and comprehensiveness when it \r\ncomes to the agenda of the General Assembly, which \r\nis the only inclusive and the chief policymaking forum. \r\nThat is why Ukraine introduced to the agenda of the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly the item entitled \r\n“The situation in the temporarily occupied territories \r\nof Ukraine”. Member States should be provided with \r\nevery possibility for in-depth considerations of all \r\nurgent situations that require the attention of the \r\ninternational community. As outlined by the President \r\nof the General Assembly, we have to facilitate quick \r\nand effective responses to emergency situations by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. As one of the Vice-Presidents of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session, Ukraine \r\nstands ready to contribute to that.\r\nAs Member States, we conferred on the Security \r\nCouncil the primary responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. What should we \r\ndo if a veto-holding member of the Security Council \r\nuses that right to veto in order to help itself escape \r\nfrom responsibility, rather than to help international \r\npeace and stability? It is time to say that the abuse of \r\nthe right to veto is a constraint that often prevents our \r\nOrganization from acting. We believe that progress on \r\nthe reform of the Security Council will be an important \r\ncontribution to the ongoing broader change at the \r\nUnited Nations. We support launching text-based talks \r\nwithin intergovernmental negotiations and are ready to \r\nengage constructively in that process.\r\nWe also expect that the ongoing reform of the \r\npeace and security pillar, which was envisaged by the \r\nSecretary-General with the support of the General \r\nAssembly, will contribute to the speed and ability \r\nof the Organization to react to the emerging threats \r\nto international peace and security. Ukraine fully \r\nshares the approach of the Secretary-General to the \r\npeacekeeping activity of the Organization under \r\nhis Action for Peacekeeping concept. It is a timely \r\nopportunity for Member States and the United Nations \r\nleadership to consider measures leading to effective \r\nand real changes to United Nations peacekeeping. \r\nThat is the same peacekeeping that Ukraine has been \r\nasking the United Nations to deploy to its territory \r\nsince April 2015, when I addressed my request, with the \r\nsupport of the Parliament of Ukraine, to the President \r\nof the Security Council, the President of the General \r\nAssembly and the Secretary-General.\r\nAfter the failure of the United Nations in \r\npreventing aggression against Ukraine, we still hoped \r\nthat the Organization would help to settle the conflict \r\nby deploying a United Nations-mandated multinational \r\npeacekeeping force to the occupied Donbas region. We \r\nhoped for a mission with a strong mandate and broad \r\nresponsibilities to help bring peace back to Ukrainian \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 9/62\r\nsoil, rather than freeze the conflict or cement the \r\npresence of the aggressor and its proxies in Donbas. We \r\nfirmly count on further progress on that important issue. \r\nAfter all — and perfectly in line with the theme for this \r\ngeneral debate, “Making the United Nations relevant to \r\nall people” — it is through Security Council-mandated \r\npeacekeeping operations that the United Nations can \r\nsave countless lives and prevent further suffering.\r\nWe remain as determined as ever to continue to \r\ndefend every inch of our territory against aggression. At \r\nthe same time, we will continue to explore all available \r\nmeans to end the conflict peacefully and restore the \r\nterritorial integrity of my country. Let me stress that \r\nUkraine has always put first legal and diplomatic \r\nmeans of conflict resolution. We have prioritized \r\nmultilateralism by turning to support from the United \r\nNations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe and the Council of Europe, as well as other \r\ninternational organizations, forums and mechanisms. \r\nWe will continue along that path. Moscow will feel the \r\nstrength of the rule of international law.\r\nWe have initiated several legal cases against the \r\nRussian side in international courts. We have already \r\nachieved important results in some of those cases. In \r\nparticular, at the beginning of 2017, the International \r\nCourt of Justice ordered Russia to lift the ban on the \r\nactivities of the Mejlis — the representative body of \r\nCrimean Tatars in occupied Crimea. However, Russia \r\ncontinues to ignore that ruling, demonstrating its \r\ndisregard not only for its international obligations but \r\nalso for the Court.\r\nAnother important element of our case before \r\nthe International Court of Justice is the downing of \r\nMalaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, in the year 2014, and \r\nthe role of the Russian Federation in that tragedy. It is \r\nimportant that Australia and the Netherlands recently \r\njoined Ukraine in its efforts to bring Russia to account. \r\nThe international community has repeatedly called on \r\nRussia to acknowledge its responsibility and change \r\nits destructive behaviour in Ukraine and elsewhere. \r\nWe know that following the legal pathway is a lengthy \r\nprocess, but we are confident that it will allow us to \r\nachieve justice in the end.\r\nIt has been almost four years since Russia’s \r\nattempted annexation and illegal occupation of Crimea \r\nand Sevastopol. Under Russian occupation, Crimea \r\nhas become a military stronghold, threatening the \r\nsecurity and stability of the entire Black Sea region. \r\nWe believe that the increasing militarization of Crimea \r\ndeserves the General Assembly’s close attention and \r\nprompt reaction. Russia’s aggressive policies and \r\narrogance in using lethal weapons multiply that threat. \r\nIn that regard, Ukraine is counting on the active support \r\nof the General Assembly to implement the relevant \r\nresolutions during this session.\r\nSince the first day of the illegal occupation of \r\nCrimea, Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians have \r\nfaced repression and discrimination. There are many \r\ncases of murder, torture, harassment and arrest on \r\nfabricated charges. The list of hostages and victims \r\nowing to the Russian occupation regime in Crimea \r\nis growing longer by the day. Being of Ukrainian or \r\nCrimean identity seems to be a criminal offence in \r\ntoday’s reality on the occupied peninsula.\r\nA Crimean farmer, Volodymyr Balukh, was \r\narrested and sentenced to five years in prison for \r\nraising a Ukrainian f lag over his private residence. \r\nCrimean film director Oleg Sentsov remains behind \r\nbars in a remote penal colony in northern Russia, \r\nserving a 20-year prison term on fabricated charges. \r\nBoth Oleg and Volodymyr are hanging in the balance \r\nbetween life and death as they remain on hunger strike. \r\nI highly appreciate the extraordinary manifestation \r\nof support and unity throughout the world in seeking \r\nthe freedom of those brave people. Unfortunately, \r\nthe Kremlin remains blind and deaf to those appeals \r\nfrom the international community and from many of \r\nRussia’s intellectuals. I call on States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to strengthen their efforts in demanding \r\nrespect for human rights in the temporarily occupied \r\nCrimea by adopting the relevant General Assembly \r\ndraft resolutions.\r\nThere are also dozens of Ukrainians being held \r\nby the occupiers in the Donbas region since the start \r\nof the Russian aggression in 2014. Ukrainian soldier \r\nSerhii Glondar has never seen his youngest daughter, \r\nas he has been held captive for three-and-a-half years. \r\nAll Ukrainian proposals to exchange Russian citizens \r\nconvicted of crimes against our sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity for the Ukrainian citizens being \r\nheld as political prisoners by the Kremlin remain \r\nunanswered.\r\nThat is just another side of Russia’s \r\nrecklessness — first sending and inciting its own \r\ncitizens into this war and then simply abandoning them \r\nafterwards. That is the thing about today’s Russia: \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n10/62 18-29877\r\nit absolutely does not care. It does not care about \r\nsuffering. It does not care about truth. It does not care \r\nabout the law. It thinks that its military might and status \r\nat the United Nations gives it that right. It is up to us to \r\nprove it wrong. It is up to us to make it care. Otherwise, \r\nwhat is the point of us being here? What would be the \r\ndifference between the era before the United Nations \r\nand that with the United Nations?\r\nIn a broader context, Ukraine has always \r\nconsidered the protection of human rights as one of the \r\ncornerstones of United Nations activities. Sustainable \r\npeace and security cannot be achieved in isolation \r\nfrom human rights. We therefore support the efforts to \r\nbring back human rights issues to the Security Council \r\nand promote close cooperation among all the relevant \r\nUnited Nations bodies in that area.\r\nMy country is delivering on its commitments under \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. Ukraine’s economy \r\ngrew in the second quarter of 2018 at an annual rate of \r\n3.8 per cent. That marks the tenth consecutive quarter \r\nof growth, which is clearly a sustainable trend. The \r\nincrease in gross domestic product (GDP) was helped by \r\nmacroeconomic stabilization, an improved investment \r\nclimate and a clean-up of the banking sector. Ukraine is \r\ndemonstrating the best dynamics of growth among the \r\nemerging markets. Despite heavy security and defence \r\nexpenses, totalling more than 6 per cent of its GDP, \r\nUkraine is undergoing fundamental transformations on \r\nsocial, economic and political tracks.\r\nWe have consistently implemented progressive \r\nreforms, ranging in areas from the judiciary, education, \r\nhealth care and public administration to carrying out \r\ndecentralization and fighting corruption. During the \r\nperiod 2019-2021, Ukraine will take on an important \r\nresponsibility as a member of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. Based on its extensive recent experience, \r\nmy country looks forward to using its membership to \r\nstrengthen the role of the Economic and Social Council \r\nin following up and reviewing the 2030 Agenda and the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, with particular regard \r\nto conflict and post-conflict settings.\r\nAmong the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nUkraine particularly welcomes the United Nations \r\ninitiatives aimed at reducing global hunger. Today, \r\nwith more than 850 million people starving around \r\nthe world, my country cannot stand idle and is ready \r\nto offer its help to the world in addressing the issue of \r\nfood security. Ukraine knows the cost of that tragedy \r\nlike no one else. In November, we will mark the eighty-\r\nfifth anniversary of one of the deadliest crimes of the \r\ntwentieth century — that of the Holodomor, which \r\nsaw mass starvation in Ukraine, artificially created \r\nby the Stalinist regime. It took the lives of several \r\nmillion Ukrainians. In that regard, I would like to \r\nrenew my appeal to the Assembly to mark one of the \r\ngreatest tragedies in human history by adopting a \r\ndedicated declaration.\r\nOur Organization is only as strong as we want \r\nand allow it to be. Therefore, our full support and \r\nstrong political will are required to ensure that the \r\nUnited Nations remains relevant in today’s uncertain \r\nand turbulent times, and relevant, as is rightly stated \r\nin the theme of this general debate, to all people. It \r\nis our mission and shared responsibility to empower \r\nthe United Nations to do what is expected of the \r\nOrganization and to do it through our global leadership \r\nbased on the shared values of freedom, the rule of law \r\nand tolerance.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof Ukraine for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Honduras.\r\nMr. Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, President \r\nof the Republic of Honduras, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Juan Orlando \r\nHernández Alvarado, President of the Republic of \r\nHonduras, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Hernández Alvarado (spoke in \r\nSpanish): In delivering my statement to the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session, I would like \r\nto express my gratitude for the support of the United \r\nNations to the national political dialogue under way \r\nin Honduras, undertaken at the initiative of several \r\nopposition leaders as well as my Government. Various \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 11/62\r\npolitical forces and civil society organizations are \r\ntaking part in the national dialogue, which remains open \r\nto anyone wishing to participate. One of the main goals \r\nof the dialogue is to propose electoral reforms with a \r\nview to building a new model. Only yesterday, by 110 \r\nout of 128 votes, the National Congress of Honduras \r\nappointed a committee for modernizing and updating \r\nthe national identification system from which the voter \r\nregistry is established. As well, the idea is to set up \r\na new, modern and transparent technical system for \r\nauthentic identification, all with a view to development.\r\nAs we meet at this great world forum and express our \r\nmost sincere desire to work together as a team in order \r\nto build peace and find solutions, I also cannot avoid \r\nexpressing my frustration at the lack of will and courage \r\nto make possible many of the ideas voiced here, despite \r\nthe enormous size and amount of resources managed \r\nby the United Nations. Since the creation of the United \r\nNations, it has been well established that respect for the \r\nsovereignty and self-determination of every State must \r\nbe a priority for world peace. The principle of sovereign \r\nequality is crucial for the stability of the world. If we \r\nwant to live in a harmonious system, we must comply \r\nwith the pillars of the Organization, as reflected in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nWe see international forces and actors constantly \r\nlooking out for their own interests and interfering in our \r\ninternal affairs, among other things, thereby affecting \r\nour democracy, which is a fundamental element for the \r\ndevelopment of nations that we are willing to defend. I \r\nsay this today and I will say it tomorrow and always: it \r\nis necessary to protect the rule of law in our homeland. \r\nWe live in new times with new realities and new \r\nchallenges. The world demands great transformations \r\nand profound reforms. It is up to our current generation \r\nof leaders to live up to the demands of our peoples. That \r\nis an unavoidable responsibility.\r\nI should now like to speak about the reality in my \r\ncountry, Honduras. We have been one of the countries \r\nmost impacted by extreme weather events over the \r\npast 20 years, ranking first in the Germanwatch \r\nGlobal Climate Risk Index. Despite being one of the \r\nworld’s most vulnerable countries, Honduran society \r\nas a whole has been working to combat the effects of \r\nclimate change. Excessive bureaucracy has prevented \r\naccess to financing from the vaunted green funds; \r\nwere we to have access, it would allow us to undertake \r\naction and contribute to reforestation, conservation and \r\nmitigation. I am convinced that it is the obligation of \r\nthe United Nations and of each and every one of us to \r\nreview and resolve as soon as possible the way those \r\nfunds are used, rather than keeping them locked up in \r\nthe vaults of the banks of the world. Every minute that \r\nthose funds remain in bank vaults, the banking system \r\ngets richer and causes suffering to humankind.\r\nMigration is a human right. Human beings have \r\nbeen on the move and migrating for centuries, thereby \r\ncontributing to the social and economic development of \r\nthe countries that welcomed them as they sought better \r\nopportunities. Honduras and the Central American \r\nregion are no exception. Unfortunately, in recent times \r\nthe entire world has witnessed the cruelty with which \r\nmigrants, including my compatriots, have been treated. \r\nWe have all seen the subhuman conditions in which \r\nthey are held in detention centres, which trample on the \r\ndignity inherent to the human person. That undignified \r\ntreatment is in addition to the daily abuse that thousands \r\nof migrants receive along the route of terror from South \r\nAmerica through Central America to the United States, \r\nwhere they are victims of all kinds of violations by \r\ncriminal networks, whether they be called coyotes, \r\nhuman traffickers, drug traffickers, maras or gangs.\r\nI reaffirm that the principle of the dignity of the \r\nhuman person is a fundamental part of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. We must act against the circumstances \r\nin which the most sacred institution of humankind, the \r\nfamily, is trampled upon and destroyed. With much \r\npain, to date we continue to await the reunification of \r\n120 separated children, who are being deprived of a \r\nright so basic and, at the same time, so fundamental for \r\ntheir development as is the family unit. The members \r\nof the Assembly can never forget the commitment \r\nto universal and effective respect for fundamental \r\nhuman rights and freedoms, in which the overriding \r\ninterests of children must prevail. That is where we \r\nneed diligence from senior United Nations officials and \r\nevery Government of the world.\r\nMr. Vitrenko (Ukraine), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nEconomic integration in Central America has \r\nbeen a major dream that we have longed for since \r\n1951. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador took the \r\ninitiative today to take a step towards fulfilling that goal \r\nby creating the first customs union in the Americas. \r\nOur region enjoys a privileged location, with maritime \r\nborders on both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, \r\nthereby acting as a link connecting the rest of the world \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n12/62 18-29877\r\nto the Americas. Our objective is the establishment of \r\na Central American common market, which entails the \r\ncreation of a free trade zone and a common external \r\ntariff that establish the foundation for setting up a \r\nCentral American customs union. That is one of those \r\ninstances where the United Nations must become more \r\naggressively involved.\r\nWe are working on integrating into that system the \r\nother countries of Central America, thereby enhancing \r\na zone that holds great potential and enormous resources \r\nto be developed. Once fully established in Central \r\nAmerica, that effort will make us the seventh-largest \r\neconomy in Latin America. This model represents an \r\nopportunity to promote an American customs union \r\nthat ensures the economic integration of the entire \r\ncontinent. Today, from this rostrum, I invite delegations, \r\non the basis of paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 1 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, and with the support of \r\nthe Organization of American States, to turn the region \r\ninto an area of peace, prosperity and free trade, like the \r\none Morazán and Bolívar imagined.\r\nA customs union seeks to facilitate trade, but trade \r\nin which justice and fairness prevail. Today, the item \r\nat the top of the agenda of the United Nations is the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which in \r\nessence constitute a frontal attack on poverty. In the \r\ncontext of the commitments it has undertaken under \r\nthe SDGs, my Government has already approved \r\nthe establishment of a national commission for the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Still, the SDGs have sadly been \r\ninterpreted as setting forth double standards, as \r\nmillions of coffee producers — mainly the smallest \r\nones, who are today receiving a price below their \r\ncosts, which undoubtedly leads them in to extreme \r\npoverty — have witnessed. That is the case with \r\napproximately 90,000 coffee-producing families in my \r\ncountry, Honduras — and when I speak of my country, \r\nHonduras, in terms of coffee production, I am not \r\ntalking about just any country, because we are the fifth-\r\nlargest coffee producer in the world, the third-largest in \r\nAmerica and the largest in Central America.\r\nI would like to ask members of delegations a \r\nquestion. How many of them have a cup of coffee in \r\nthe morning or during the day? We know that there is \r\na very high possibility that, without knowing it, they \r\nhave participated in an enormous injustice. Since we are \r\nall promoters of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nwe must not turn a deaf ear to the fact that generates \r\nextreme poverty. A cup of coffee in New York City \r\ncan cost $5, or 500 cents. Do members of delegations \r\nknow how much the small coffee producers in my \r\ncountry receive after working hard under the sun and \r\nrain, harvesting every single grain of coffee by hand? \r\nI want to tell them — these producers do not get even \r\ntwo cents for every cup of coffee, and it costs $5, or 500 \r\ncents, yielding barely two cents for the producer. Is this \r\nor is this not an injustice?\r\nI know that those who applaud recognize that it is \r\nan injustice. That cannot be. We cannot close our eyes, \r\nstop listening or cease allowing something to stir in our \r\nconscience and wake us up. That is why we are here.\r\nWe have been talking about the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals for a long time. However, I must \r\nask, does it make sense to ignore the crisis that millions \r\nof small coffee producers are living through? In my \r\ncountry, there are only approximately 90,000, but in the \r\nAmericas all together there are more than 14 million \r\nproducers and in the world 25 million producer \r\nfamilies, and millions more indirectly dependent on \r\ncoffee production. We must act now — today.\r\nWhile the United Nations is taking action on this \r\nissue — I say this because I am convinced that it is \r\ngoing to take action on the issue — I call on all the \r\nPresidents of the coffee-producing countries and the \r\ncoffee producers of the world to organize themselves, \r\nbecause it is clear that no one is in fact looking out for \r\nthe interests of the world’s poor small coffee producers.\r\nThe first time I had the honour of addressing the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I said that the greatest tragedy that \r\nHonduras has suffered in the history of the Republic \r\nhas been the wave of violence resulting from drug \r\ntrafficking (see A/69/PV.7). Our country is a transit \r\nzone for drugs produced in the southern part of the \r\ncontinent and consumed in the north. In addition to the \r\nscourge of drug trafficking, gangs, youth gangs and \r\ncriminal groups have in the past literally supplanted \r\nStates themselves in several regions, countries and \r\ncircumstances. In my country, there are armed \r\nnon-State groups that, when affirmatively confronted \r\nby good Hondurans who desire to live in peace, and \r\nare the object of the Government’s efforts to restore \r\npeace and security, go so far as to threaten electoral \r\nprocesses, democracy and the rule of law. It is my firm \r\nconviction that in Honduras these non-State actors are \r\nviolating fundamental rights — the human rights — of \r\nthousands of their compatriots. More alarming is the \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 13/62\r\nfact that I have repeatedly made this denunciation in \r\nother United Nations bodies and in the Organization of \r\nAmerican States, and until today we have not received \r\nany answers.\r\nThat is why I wanted to clearly draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the issue. This situation should trigger \r\nalarms for States and specifically for the United Nations \r\nin the defence of the rule of law and representative \r\ndemocracy. I emphasize that it is a question of such \r\nfundamental rights as the right to life, freedom and \r\nthe enjoyment of participatory democracy. Therefore, \r\nI take this opportunity to ask that delegations draft a \r\nresolution that recognizes that gangs, youth gangs and \r\nother criminal groups should be considered non-State \r\nentities that violate human rights and threaten the \r\nstability of States.\r\nAt a high cost and at great risk, we in Honduras \r\ndecided to face this monstrous multiheaded challenge, \r\nand like very few countries in the region we have made \r\nprogress, increasingly entrenching a climate of greater \r\nsecurity and peace each day. But I can acknowledge \r\nthat not enough has been done yet. That is why there \r\ncan be no State Member of the United Nations that \r\nconsiders itself a supporter of democracy, pacifist or \r\nfull of respect for life and does not heed our call, which \r\nis also the call of other peoples who have suffered under \r\nthe same circumstances.\r\nWe must honour that generation that had the vision \r\nto create the General Assembly and ensure respect for \r\nthe sovereignty of nations and the self-determination \r\nof peoples. I represent a country that, like every country, \r\nhas problems and faces great challenges. I represent a \r\ncountry that is small in the size of its territory but great \r\nin dignity. I emphatically wish to say that I could not \r\nforgive myself coming to the General Assembly and not \r\nmaking an appeal to the conscience of world leaders to \r\nadopt a transcendent attitude, demanding that we pass \r\nfrom words to concrete actions that change the lives of \r\nthe peoples of the world for the better.\r\nI call for the protection of our democracies and \r\nhuman rights from attacks by armed non-State actors, \r\ngangs, youth gangs and criminal groups. I call for \r\nrespect for the principle of the best interests of the child \r\nand the family as the holiest institution of humankind. \r\nI call for leading by example when it comes to the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nprotecting the world’s small coffee producers so that \r\nthey receive what they deserve through a truly fair \r\ntrade, since this fair trade implies not only obligations \r\nfor producers but also that their rights are respected, \r\nwhich is what access to a fair profit would be.\r\nIn Honduras, we are ready to move from words and \r\npromises on paper to action. In Honduras, we are ready \r\nto act through actions that bring results.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Honduras for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, President \r\nof the Republic of Honduras, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President and \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President and Commander-in-Chief \r\nof the Defence Forces of the Republic of Kenya.\r\nMr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President and \r\nCommander in -Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President \r\nand Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces of \r\nthe Republic of Kenya, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Kenyatta: Let me take this very early \r\nopportunity to congratulate Ms. María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa Garcés on her election to preside over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session. I have \r\nno doubt that the experience she draws from her \r\ndistinguished career in the service of the Republic of \r\nEcuador will be invaluable to her as she executes her \r\nnew responsibility. I also note with appreciation that \r\nher strategic priorities for the seventy-third session, \r\nnamely, strengthening multilateralism, catalysing the \r\nwell-being of all persons and working to bring about a \r\nsustainable planet, as well as building a stronger, more \r\nefficient multilateral system, converge with Kenya’s \r\naspirations. It is therefore my pleasure to reaffirm my \r\nGovernment’s complete commitment to our shared \r\nvision and to supporting the President during her tenure.\r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n14/62 18-29877\r\nThe seventy-third session of the General Assembly \r\nis the second session to be held during the tenure of \r\nSecretary-General Guterres, who has already spoken \r\npublicly about the financial situation of the United \r\nNations and has even spelled out reforms that need to be \r\nexecuted to ensure optimal utilization of our finances. \r\nI applaud the Secretary-General for his efforts and \r\ncourage to cut costs and for his commitment to ensuring \r\nthat the Organization’s resources are better managed. \r\nIndeed, I am convinced that part of those objectives \r\nwill be achieved with the adoption of the proposals \r\nmade in the context of the adoption of the global service \r\ndelivery model. In that regard, it is my hope that Kenya \r\nwill have the privilege to host one of the proposed three \r\nservice centres. I also applaud the commitment of the \r\nUnited Nations staff, who are engaged daily in tackling \r\na myriad of challenges that are greater than any one \r\ncountry or region can resolve on its own.\r\nKenya strongly supports the General Assembly’s \r\nembrace of better alignment in the mandates of \r\nurbanization, human settlement and environmental \r\ngovernance. Its approach will enable the United Nations \r\nHuman Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) and \r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) \r\nto fully deliver on their role as global focal points for \r\nhuman settlements and environmental matters for the \r\nentire United Nations system.\r\nEven as we speak of important reforms at the \r\nUnited Nations, we must also recognize that the need \r\nfor reforms is much broader and of greater significance \r\nthan previously acknowledged. In almost every part \r\nof the world, a growing lack of trust is opening a \r\ndangerous gap between citizens and their governing \r\ninstitutions. That situation is partly the result of the \r\nimpact of a number of significant factors, key among \r\nwhich is the growing demand by all our citizenry for \r\naccountability, occasioned by the attendant awareness \r\nof the gap between available resources and the \r\nprovision of services to populations. Such demands are \r\nalso fuelled by a growing awareness of the scourge of \r\ncorruption and wastage of public resources and their \r\nnegative effects on the lives and hopes of people.\r\nDue to the benefits of accessible information, never \r\nbefore in human history have so many people known \r\nhow public trust is undermined by acts of commission \r\nor omission by a few individuals or networks, both in the \r\nprivate and public sectors. Weak systems of governance \r\nare manipulated and exploited for the gain of predatory \r\ninterests at the expense of the common person. Free \r\nmedia and social media are rife with news of outright \r\nfraud, cynical conflicts of interest and financial \r\narrangements that privatize gains during prosperous \r\ntimes and socialize losses during economic catastrophe.\r\nIn addition to individual corruption, major \r\ncorporations misrepresent their earnings to deny \r\nGovernments revenue needed for investment in the \r\npublic good. The extraction of mineral and other \r\nresources continues to be subject to corrupt dealings that \r\nnot only deny communities and countries any benefit \r\nbut almost routinely lead to violence and instability. \r\nSuch dealings have over several decades been clothed \r\nwith the garments of legality, institutionalizing the \r\nexploitation by cartels and oligopolies that are pillaging \r\nAfrica and other underdeveloped regions of their natural \r\nwealth. That is the source of the popular theorizing on \r\nAfrica’s resource curse.\r\nIt has become clearer to citizens all over the world \r\nthat what is enabling the illegal and illicit conduct \r\nof corrupt individuals and companies is a globalized \r\nfinancial and legal system. Its impact is worldwide but \r\nit is probably the leading cause of most of the suffering \r\non the African continent.\r\nThere is increasing evidence that Africa is a net \r\nexporter of much-needed capital to the world through \r\nillicit outf lows. Conservative estimates indicate that \r\nbetween 1980 and 2009 illicit money outf lows from \r\nAfrica ranged from $1.2 trillion to $1.4 trillion, roughly \r\nequal to Africa’s current gross domestic product and \r\nsurpassing by far the money it received from outside \r\nover the same period. Every illicit dollar that leaves \r\nAfrica goes somewhere — most often to where the \r\nrest of the money from tax evaders and criminals is \r\nhidden. Africans suffer as a result, but the irony is that \r\nwhat is done to Africa is eventually done to the rest of \r\nthe world.\r\nThe present system of transferring and laundering \r\nillicit capital is enabling corrupt networks all over the \r\nworld to illegally acquire in one country, while being \r\nwelcomed with open arms as investors in another. \r\nThe same system is used by drug cartels and even \r\nterrorist networks. Collectively, drug addiction, violent \r\nextremism, international crime and terrorist actions \r\nresult in misery and hurt to millions of victims all over \r\nthe world.\r\nThe most tragic manifestation of the destructive \r\nimpact of the misery as a result of the crimes mentioned \r\nheretofore is the loss of trust in governing institutions \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 15/62\r\nat the national, regional and global levels. As people \r\nobserve the impunity, they increasingly feel that the \r\neconomic systems are rigged against their hopes. \r\nTherefore, the trust deficit grows.\r\nFrequently, institutions of Government have \r\nbecome desirable vehicles to capture ethnic or racial \r\ninterests articulated by populists and extremists who \r\nthrive in chronic instability and drive it forward \r\nwith their incitement. When networks and cartels in \r\nGovernment capture the State for their own selfish gain \r\nand represent themselves as champions of an ethnic or \r\nreligious group, the result is all too often civil strife and \r\ncivil war. In such an atmosphere, the result of a political \r\ncompetition can begin to seem like an existential threat \r\nto groups and their members.\r\nThe fragility of our world is also manifest in \r\ninstability and conflicts, as in the case of both Somalia \r\nand South Sudan. In Somalia, the African Union Mission \r\nin Somalia (AMISOM) is a unique regional effort that \r\nhas deeply degraded one of Al-Qaida’s most ambitious \r\naffiliates. Kenya has been part of that journey from \r\nthe start. It was in Nairobi where a transitional federal \r\nState was negotiated into existence, with the material \r\nand moral support of the Kenyan people. We have \r\nnever wavered. Kenyans have lost lives and property \r\nin pursuit of peace and stability in Somalia, and we \r\nappreciate our regional and international colleagues and \r\npartners. In Somalia, a historic chapter on Africa’s will \r\nto peace and security is being written. We appreciate \r\nthe partners standing with the region.\r\nBut the job is not yet done. We must ensure \r\nmilitary success over Al-Shabaab if other political \r\nand economic solutions are to take firm root. So far, \r\nthe troop-contributing countries continue to bear a \r\ndisproportionate burden. We have consistently sought \r\nthe kind of international support that is commensurate \r\nwith the threat scenario, including in the form of \r\nenablers and force multipliers. These have not been \r\nforthcoming. What the international community is \r\ndoing with regard to Somalia is not good enough. We \r\nunderstand that these are difficult times economically, \r\nbut global terrorism must be faced boldly. If we have \r\nlearned any real lessons in the past 20 years, we should \r\nappreciate that AMISOM needs support, and it is up to \r\nall of us to make that happen.\r\nIn building peace there are no silver bullets. The \r\nprocess of bringing stability and peace to South Sudan \r\nrequires commitment. It requires us to walk closely \r\nwith the South Sudanese parties, particularly now after \r\nthe signing of the revitalized peace agreement. Kenya \r\nis proud of having walked with the Sudan and South \r\nSudan in their pursuit of peace and stability. We have \r\nalways known and firmly believe that the constancy of \r\nour efforts would yield the fruit of a prosperous and \r\nfree South Sudan.\r\nToday, we call on all Member States to join us \r\nin that endeavour for peace and stability in South \r\nSudan. I appeal to all Members, development partners, \r\ninternational agencies and friends of South Sudan \r\nto redouble their efforts and support this cause to \r\nend the suffering of the children, women and men of \r\nSouth Sudan.\r\nAllow me to turn to the global sphere, which has also \r\nnot been spared the challenges of today. Multilateralism \r\nis under severe strain, as evidenced by our global \r\ntrading and economic management system. Rarely has \r\nthe system of trade and security that was established \r\nfollowing the Second World War, under the auspices \r\nof the United Nations, been under greater strain. The \r\npopulism and extremism unleashed at the national level \r\nhas brought forward powerful constituencies that want \r\na dismantling of the global order.\r\nI believe that the most urgent political task in the \r\nworld today is to close the trust gap between people \r\nand governing institutions. Governments are not owed \r\ntrust by citizens; that trust must be won and protected. \r\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that the future of global \r\nstability and the continuity of many States turn on this \r\nissue.\r\nThere are bold solutions that we must embrace \r\nin order to succeed. We have to fight impunity, \r\nseriously and without fear or favour. In Kenya, we are \r\nundertaking an aggressive campaign against fraud \r\nand abuse of public trust. We have reached out to \r\nour partners in Switzerland and the United Kingdom \r\nto take action against transfers of illegal proceeds of \r\ncorruption to their banking and financial systems. \r\nWe will pursue more such bilateral arrangements. \r\nThey must be accompanied by determined reforms \r\nthat are subject to clear timelines and standards, and \r\nwhich combat systemic corruption in the multilateral \r\nsystem, money-laundering and the offshoring of illicit \r\noutf lows. The single overarching aim must be to make \r\nit exceedingly difficult to transfer and launder illegally \r\nacquired wealth in any part of the world.\r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n16/62 18-29877\r\nIndeed, all United Nations bodies should be given \r\nthe task of detecting corruption in their different \r\nfocus areas and promoting the skills and systems to \r\ncombat it, in the understanding that honest, transparent \r\nand responsive Government is fundamental to the \r\nachievement of their aims. We must create a stronger \r\nunderstanding of the presence and impact of such deals \r\nin their different focus areas.\r\nThe gap in trust that we are talking about at the \r\nnational level can also be found at the global level and \r\nis aimed squarely at the leadership and processes of \r\nthe multilateral system, as reflected in the Security \r\nCouncil, the Bretton Woods institutions and other \r\nparts of the system. In the years following the Second \r\nWorld War, the present status quo was functional and \r\nunderstandable. That is no longer the case 75 years \r\nlater. The global governance system must also undergo \r\nreform if it is to be relevant and effective.\r\nThe clearest sign that change is real will be in \r\nreforms to the membership of the Security Council. \r\nKenya joins the demand for two permanent seats for \r\nAfrica — with the rights and prerogatives of current \r\nmembers, including the right of veto, as well as \r\nadditional non-permanent seats. As we all know, Africa \r\nis underrepresented in the non-permanent category of the \r\nSecurity Council, and we are not represented at all in the \r\npermanent category. That historical injustice is a clear \r\nindication of the skewed system that has perpetuated \r\nan exclusive model of governance that fuels the trust \r\ngap between nations. The governance, leadership and \r\nemployment in United Nations funds, programmes and \r\nagencies must also become more noticeably inclusive of \r\nthe global South, especially Africa.\r\nKenya is a proud host to the only United Nations \r\nglobal headquarters in the global South, namely, the \r\nheadquarters of both UNEP and UN-Habitat, whose \r\nmandates and effectiveness we are strongly committed to \r\nsupporting. We strongly believe that the multilateralism \r\nthat would headquarter major organizations in Africa \r\nand the global South is what the world needs. Global \r\ndecision-making needs more of Africa if the world is to \r\nrespond wisely to the demographic and economic shifts \r\nthat are under way.\r\nWithout Governments and the international system \r\naddressing the broadening deficits in fairness and \r\ninclusiveness, corruption, populism, radicalization, \r\ncivil strife and political instability will continue \r\nto destabilize and destroy. Today’s problems, risks \r\nand threats are complex and call for more — not \r\nless — cooperation, more —not less — observance of \r\nthe rule of law, more — not less — negotiation. We need \r\na rules-based multilateral system. We are at a decisive \r\nmoment, and Kenya will play its part to be a champion \r\nfor change. I welcome all delegations in a campaign for \r\nour collective benefit.\r\nIn conclusion, the sea is increasingly being seen \r\nas a sustainable source of food, jobs and prosperity for \r\nthe growing populations of the world. It is with that in \r\nmind that Kenya and Canada will co-host the first-ever \r\nglobal conference on the sustainable blue economy from \r\n26 to 28 November this year, in Nairobi. I therefore \r\ntake this opportunity to welcome all delegations to this \r\nconference and its deliberations on how we can access \r\nand harness financing, technology and skills as well as \r\ninnovations and capacity-building to allow us to turn \r\nthe blue economy into a driver of millions of jobs, a \r\nsource of food and sustainable shared prosperity. We \r\nwill be greatly honoured to host you, Mr. President, \r\nin Nairobi.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I wish to thank the President and \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President and \r\nCommander in -Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Taneti Maamau, President, Head of \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nImmigration of the Republic of Kiribati\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration of \r\nthe Republic of Kiribati.\r\nMr. Taneti Maamau, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration \r\nof the Republic of Kiribati, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Taneti Maamau, President, \r\nHead of Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Immigration of the Republic of Kiribati, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 17/62\r\nPresident Maamau: I begin by sharing peace and \r\nblessings among us all and conveying warm Pacific \r\ngreetings from the Government and the people of \r\nKiribati. In the name of Almighty God, Kam na bane ni \r\nMauri — May all be blessed.\r\nI join other leaders in congratulating the President \r\nof the General Assembly, and the Government of \r\nEcuador, on her election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session. I wish her every \r\nsuccess as she discharges her functions by making the \r\nUnited Nations family relevant to all Members. By \r\nthe same token, I would also like to acknowledge the \r\noutgoing President, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, and the Slovak \r\nRepublic for the very engaging and outcome-oriented \r\nleadership of the seventy-second session. I also thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his excellent leadership, in \r\nparticular with regard to the current reform to make the \r\nUnited Nations fit for purpose and more adaptable for \r\nthe present and future.\r\nWe commend the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor the theme that she has chosen for the seventy-third \r\nsession, “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. \r\nThat is a strong call on and reminder to all leaders and \r\nthe United Nations machinery that the effectiveness \r\nof our efforts is measured not by how much we have \r\nachieved, but by how much we have changed the lives \r\nof those whom we serve for the better. Clearly, it was \r\nthe primary intent of the founders that this should be \r\nthe United Nations as they envisioned it. It is about \r\nservant leadership, whereby leadership is not only \r\nabout serving but, more important, about protecting the \r\nlives of the powerless — those without a voice, those \r\ntaken advantage of by the more powerful in society, and \r\nthose who cannot help themselves politically.\r\nWe are reminded time and again that those people’s \r\nlives are precious in the sight of God. In her captivating \r\nand simple words, Mother Theresa reflected powerfully \r\non the life of a servant leader when she said, “A life not \r\nlived for others is not a life”. As leaders, it is our shared \r\nresponsibility to ensure that we see to that. The theme \r\nalso provides a timely call for a renewal of friendship, \r\nsolidarity, cooperation and partnership between and \r\namong the peoples and nations of the world, thereby \r\nallowing greater commitment on all our part to make a \r\ndifference for the well-being of all.\r\nKiribati has long recognized the prime importance \r\nof peaceful living, characterized by our own traditional, \r\nhumble way of living in harmony with one another and \r\nour environment. Those are sustained through regular \r\ncommunity meetings in traditional local meeting \r\nhouses, called maneaba, to discuss important issues \r\nconcerning the village and to address issues under \r\nthe wise and experienced guidance of our elders. \r\nDecisions are made to promote mutual understanding, \r\nrespect and cooperation among members of the entire \r\nsociety. Maneaba means “to embrace all” — a holistic \r\nsystem in which leadership and shared responsibility \r\nare undertaken for the benefit of the whole society. \r\nAccordingly, the maneaba system maintains its \r\nfundamentality as central and relevant to the people.\r\nIn the Pacific context, other relevant instruments \r\nhave been adopted to address social, economic and \r\npolitical risks and security. Some have worked, \r\nwhile others have not, but that does not stop us from \r\nmaintaining our resolve, through our own Pacific way, \r\nto undertake meaningful dialogue in which agreement \r\nthrough consensus serves as a prevalent norm. \r\nMoreover, the Pacific accounts for 20 per cent of the \r\nworld’s oceans in terms of our exclusive economic zone, \r\nand therefore the completion of maritime boundaries is \r\nvery critical to providing certainty about the ownership \r\nof our ocean space in the face of climate change.\r\nA united world free from the threats of wars and \r\nviolence, rooted in our greed to dominate others, is the \r\nkind of world that we want for all of us and for our \r\nchildren’s generation. Our ultimate aim is to ensure \r\nthat everyone can lead a happy, prosperous and secure \r\nfuture. The adoption of the historic United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea in 1982 has also \r\nenabled us to own and sustainably manage a huge area \r\nof ocean, from which we can further improve our well-\r\nbeing and enjoy returns from our fisheries resources. \r\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has also \r\nassured us that the radiation-related illnesses suffered \r\nby our people during and after the 1960s nuclear testing \r\non Christmas Island and other parts of the world will \r\nnot recur in the future. There are many other examples \r\nof how international resolutions and instruments \r\nhave contributed immensely to our national efforts to \r\nimprove our island way of life. We have no doubt that \r\nother peoples and nations see the United Nations in the \r\nsame light.\r\nAs an organization, the United Nations is bound to \r\nbe constantly pulled and pushed between two opposing \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n18/62 18-29877\r\nbut interconnected interests: the personal interests of \r\nthose leading and driving it, on the one hand, and the \r\ninterests of the people for whom it exists, on the other. \r\nIt is therefore critical that the Assembly have the ability \r\nto ensure that a balance is maintained so that the United \r\nNations does not end up benefiting only those running \r\nand facilitating its operations.\r\nIn that regard, we look forward to the outcome \r\nof the reform of the United Nations development \r\nsystem, on which our views have been adequately \r\nexpressed through statements made on our behalf by \r\nthe groupings of the Pacific small island developing \r\nStates, the Alliance of Small Island States, the least \r\ndeveloped countries and the Group of 77 and China. In \r\nparticular, we look forward to the positioning of a new \r\nResident Coordinator to serve the northern and central \r\nPacific territories and countries. We also look forward \r\nto the outcome of other reforms and reviews pertaining \r\nto the Security Council, the Human Rights Council, the \r\neligibility and graduation criteria in relation to least \r\ndeveloped countries and, finally, the financing status \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nWe also fully appreciate the United Nations \r\nparticular focus on the plight of people in developing \r\ncountries, especially those facing special difficulties. In \r\nthat connection, we note with gratitude the Committee \r\nfor Development Policy’s recognition of Kiribati’s \r\nextreme vulnerability to the impacts of climate change \r\nand the need for special support. That gratitude extends \r\nto the President and members of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council for agreeing to our request to have our \r\ngraduation case considered in three years’ time.\r\nWe are concerned to learn from the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General (A/73/1) about the financial \r\ndifficulties facing the United Nations to the extent that \r\nit is affecting not only its services but also the well-\r\nbeing of its staff. We understand that the United Nations \r\nhas been relying more on voluntary contributions and \r\nprivate-sector funding than assessed membership \r\ncontributions, which is a significant risk. It is therefore \r\nhigh time for us to reassess the validity of certain \r\nactivities of the United Nations that have outlived their \r\ntime and the need to realign strategies that were quite \r\napplicable and effective during the post-war years, \r\nwhen States were the key drivers of United Nations \r\nservices. Those are no longer effective with United \r\nNations services becoming the exclusive domain of \r\nhuge multinational corporations that often put profit-\r\nmaking over moral and ethical considerations.\r\nOne example is the hundreds of millions of dollars \r\nspent annually on peacekeeping and humanitarian \r\nassistance. Those funds could have been better spent on \r\neliminating the root causes of conflicts, armed terrorism \r\nand humanitarian crises by investing United Nations \r\nresources in the establishment of good governance, \r\nwith good-quality, free education and health services. \r\nIn that way, the collective resources of the world can be \r\nspent to treat the causes and not merely the symptoms.\r\nKiribati presented, for the first time, its voluntary \r\nnational review report to the United Nations in July. As I \r\nstressed in the video introduction of our review, Kiribati \r\nhas now embarked on a bold and bright narrative that \r\ncarries our people’s voice and determination, boosted by \r\nvarious resilience-building programmes allowing us to \r\nforge ahead with a 20-year road map and transforming \r\nKiribati into a wealthy, healthy and peaceful nation \r\nby 2036. That is our Kiribati 20-year vision, known \r\nas KV20, which aspires to move the nation and people \r\nbeyond orthodoxy through the unleashing of the \r\nenormous potentials vested in our fisheries and tourism. \r\nI must, however, emphasize that underpinning the \r\ndrive and implementation of that ambitious aspiration \r\nis making Kiribati a corruption-free society, as part of \r\nour strong commitment to championing anti-corruption \r\nin the Pacific.\r\nWe will follow through on that with the regional \r\nleaders meeting on anti-corruption, to be held on our \r\nshores in 2019. Corruption undeniably poses a human \r\nrisk to all forms of development, and it is the weak and \r\nthe marginalized who suffer and bear the highest cost \r\nof such unethical practices. Kiribati has also, for the \r\nfirst time ever, launched a climate change policy. That \r\nfocuses on building and strengthening the resilience \r\nof our islands and people in adapting to the impacts \r\nof climate change. The policy highlights priority areas \r\nin water management, sanitation, coastal protection \r\nand renewable energy, and will serve as the country’s \r\nnational compass for the delivery of all climate-change \r\nprogrammes in Kiribati. We acknowledge our many \r\npartners that have worked and continue to work with \r\nKiribati. We welcome those who are also ready to work \r\nand journey together with us to build and strengthen the \r\nresilience of our people and islands.\r\nTo that end, I am pleased to reaffirm that we continue \r\nto maintain 11 per cent of our exclusive economic zone \r\nin the Phoenix Islands, comprising over 400,000 square \r\nkilometres of ocean as a marine protected area. That \r\nwell-known area — the Phoenix Islands Protected \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 19/62\r\nArea — is considered to be a powerful and effective \r\ntool for the rejuvenation of tuna fisheries and other \r\nmarine organisms and a source of resilient coral species, \r\nknown as super corals, many of which have a lifespan \r\nof over 100 years. From our understanding of the early \r\nfindings of science, the Phoenix Islands Protected Area \r\nis home to one of the richest, most diverse and most \r\nresilient marine ecosystems on the planet. It has the \r\npotential to become the most powerful source of marine \r\nlife enrichment and provide solutions to many of the \r\nproblems facing humankind, which the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development is trying to address.\r\nBy closing off the area to commercial fishing, \r\nwe have sacrificed a substantial amount of annual \r\nincome from fishing licences, which is estimated \r\nat approximately 10 per cent of our annual fishing \r\nrevenue, averaging almost $10 million annually. \r\nWhile that is forgone revenue, it is part of Kiribati’s \r\nstrong commitment to implementing the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). In addition, I am proud \r\nto announce that Kiribati has also declared its entire \r\nexclusive economic zone as a shark sanctuary, which has \r\nbeen incorporated into our national laws. In that regard, \r\nwe commend current efforts to create new legally \r\nbinding instruments on the use of marine biological \r\ndiversity in marine areas outside our exclusive economic \r\nzone, migration and the environment, all of which are \r\nvery important for small islands like Kiribati, including \r\nother nations and peoples.\r\nThe United Nations theme to be delivered in the next \r\n12 months is about all the people living on this planet. \r\nThat theme will be irrelevant if the United Nations \r\ncontinues to ignore the 20 million people who live and \r\ncontribute to our shared home and to exclude them from \r\nthe process. We are one family, and we therefore call for \r\nan inclusive approach enabling Taiwan to participate in \r\ninternational processes and to contribute to addressing \r\nareas of concern to this United Nations organ, including \r\nthe implementation of the SDGs.\r\nFor too long, we have been confined to our human \r\ndesire to dominate, while lacking consideration, \r\ncompassion and respect for others as they seek to \r\npursue sustainable development in their own right \r\nand space, but let us remind ourselves and the United \r\nNations family of the equally important responsibility \r\nof recognizing a space for a United Nations prayer day. \r\nThe objective in that regard is to seek divine guidance \r\nfor our work agenda. Quite often, we tend to overlook \r\nthe importance of divine guidance as a powerful tool \r\nthat can really unite our hearts in a shared aspiration to \r\nmake the United Nations a truly global institution for \r\nall people and to build the trust, respect and love that \r\nwe all need to make a genuine difference. May God’s \r\ngrace and compassion continue to bless our hearts as \r\nwe strive to strengthen the Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to share Kiribati’s traditional \r\nblessings of Te mauri, te raoi ao te tabomoa, which \r\nmeans “health, peace and prosperity to us all”.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President, Head of \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nImmigration of the Republic of Kiribati for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Taneti Maamau, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration \r\nof the Republic of Kiribati, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe.\r\nMr. Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, President \r\nof the Republic of Zimbabwe, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Emmerson Dambudzo \r\nMnangagwa, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mnangagwa: It is my honour and \r\npleasure to deliver my maiden statement in the General \r\nAssembly. Allow me to congratulate Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election to preside \r\nover the Assembly at its seventy-third session. As \r\nonly the fourth woman in the history of the United \r\nNations to hold that important position, her election is \r\nindeed most appropriate in terms of addressing gender \r\nequality within the Organization. The theme that she \r\nhas chosen, “Making the United Nations relevant to all \r\npeople: global leadership and shared responsibilities \r\nfor peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”, \r\nresonates well with the mantra of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, namely, to leave no one \r\nbehind. The theme is a timely reminder for us to keep \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n20/62 18-29877\r\nthe momentum going three years after the adoption of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\r\nAlso at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment is a promise to end all forms of poverty. \r\nThat shared vision and common destiny require us all \r\nto do our part in order to meet the ambitious targets and \r\ncreate a better world. For us in the developing world, \r\nthe eradication of poverty is at the top of our agenda \r\npriorities. Development must equally be placed at the \r\ncentre of the work of the United Nations, as it plays \r\nan important role in preventing hunger, deprivation, \r\nfood insecurity, disease and, ultimately, conflict. The \r\ninclusion of the interests and views of women, young \r\npeople, children and vulnerable members of our \r\nsocieties should be integral and essential components \r\nin all our programmes.\r\nI am pleased to report that Zimbabwe has made \r\nsubstantial progress in the implementation of some \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular \r\nwith regard to ensuring food security. Through our \r\npeople-centred policies and planned programmes, \r\ncomplemented by private-sector financing and \r\ninvestments, farmers receive inputs, equipment and \r\ntechnical support. In a bid to improve nutrition and \r\nbroaden income opportunities, we have also extended \r\nsupport to grow the livestock, fisheries and wildlife \r\nsectors. We are confident that those multipronged \r\nprogrammes will accelerate Zimbabwe’s re-entry into \r\nthe global economy and associated value chains. That is \r\none example of innovation, creativity and home-grown \r\nsolutions in addressing key development and economic \r\nchallenges despite the continued illegal sanctions \r\nimposed on our country. We call for their immediate and \r\nunconditional removal. Meanwhile, we look forward to \r\nthe first overall review of the implementation of the \r\nSDGs, to be held under the auspices of the General \r\nAssembly in 2019.\r\nPeace, security, stability, democracy and good \r\ngovernance are essential ingredients of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In view of the fact that elections are an \r\nintegral element of democracy, my country held its \r\nmuch-anticipated harmonized general elections on \r\n30 July. Following my deliberate and conscious decision \r\nto open up democratic space and my emphatic call for \r\npeace, unity and tolerance of divergent views among our \r\npeople, political contestations, election campaigning, \r\nvoting and counting processes were conducted freely, \r\npeacefully and transparently. In the spirit of transparency \r\nand openness, a broader spectrum of international \r\nobservers and global media houses were accredited \r\nto observe our elections. The exceptionally peaceful \r\npre- and post-electoral environments represented \r\nthe maturing and entrenchment of democracy in \r\nZimbabwe. We are grateful to the United Nations and \r\nother Member States for sending election observer \r\nmissions and for the technical assistance received by \r\nour election management body. The recommendations \r\nwill be taken into account as we deepen our democratic \r\nand electoral processes.\r\nWe will continue to entrench constitutionalism, \r\ndemocratic traditions, norms, peace, unity and harmony, \r\nfor it is indeed under such conditions that sustainable \r\ndevelopment, inclusive economic growth and prosperity \r\ncan occur. The isolated and unfortunate incident of \r\npost-election violence that occurred on 1 August, is \r\nregrettable and most unacceptable. A commission \r\nof inquiry comprised of eminent persons of national, \r\nregional and international repute has begun its work in \r\nearnest. Its ultimate report and recommendations will \r\nhelp us bring closure to the matter and assist in the \r\nimprovement of our institutional governance.\r\nNow that the elections are behind us, my country \r\nis focusing on economic development as we seek to \r\njumpstart the modernization and industrialization \r\nof our country. The land reform programme is \r\nirreversibly behind us. Emboldened by the dreams, \r\nhopes and aspirations of our people, and in tandem \r\nwith the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the African Union Agenda 2063, we have outlined \r\nour vision to become a middle-income economy with \r\na per capita income of approximately $3,500. That \r\nwill bring on board increased investment, decent \r\njobs, broad-based empowerment and a society free \r\nfrom poverty and corruption by 2030. Zimbabwe is \r\nopen for business, and we are presently undertaking \r\na raft of economic and political reforms to ensure an \r\nenvironment that facilitates inclusive and sustained \r\neconomic growth. We have put in place institutions \r\nand instruments that maximize land utilization and \r\nincrease agricultural productivity. Equally, strategies \r\nare in place in the various sectors of our economy to \r\nenable my country to enter the global value chain. The \r\ndevelopment and modernization of our roads, railways, \r\nairports, energy and information and communications \r\ntechnology infrastructure are being accelerated. in line \r\nwith our regional and continental quest for enhanced \r\nconnectivity and integrated infrastructure.\r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 21/62\r\nZimbabwe looks forward to playing a positive and \r\nconstructive role as a free, democratic, transparent, \r\nprosperous and responsible member of the family of \r\nnations. We are committed to strengthening dialogue, \r\ncooperation and partnerships, underpinned by mutual \r\nrespect, common values and shared principles. The \r\nprevention of conflict must be a front-line strategy. \r\nMy country remains committed to strengthening \r\nmultilateralism and the peaceful resolution of \r\ndifferences. In that regard, we should address the \r\nroot causes of conflict, which include poverty, \r\ninequality, deprivation and disputes over land and \r\nresources, as well as struggles for self-determination. \r\nPeacemaking and peacekeeping must be complemented \r\nby peacebuilding efforts to prevent the recurrence of \r\nand relapse into conflict. Zimbabwe continues to make \r\nits modest contributions through the deployment of its \r\npersonnel to various United Nations peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding missions.\r\nThe United Nations and its organs are in need \r\nof being democratized. We join the call for Africa \r\nto be represented in the permanent category and to \r\nhave increased representation in the non-permanent \r\ncategory. That position is indeed justified in view of the \r\nneed to correct the historical injustice that has left the \r\nAfrican continent on the periphery of all major global \r\ndecision-making processes. We emphatically call for \r\nthe review and reform of the Bretton Woods and other \r\ninternational financial institutions. Trade is an engine \r\nfor development if conducted fairly and in accordance \r\nwith agreed rules. We therefore call for negotiations, \r\nunder the auspices of the World Trade Organization, \r\nthat would foster inclusive and shared economic growth \r\nand further advance the global development agenda.\r\nIn the spirit of leaving no one behind, our efforts to \r\npromote a global partnership for peace and development \r\nwill never be complete unless we address the plight of \r\npeople living under occupation. It is most saddening \r\nthat some of us continue to turn a blind eye to the \r\nsuffering of the people of Palestine. It is high time \r\nthat the United Nations fulfil its obligations and duties \r\nunder the Charter by implementing all its relevant \r\nresolutions, including General Assembly resolution 181 \r\n(II) and Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 \r\n(1973) and 2334 (2016).\r\nOn the African continent, it is equally disheartening \r\nthat the people of Western Sahara have yet to exercise \r\ntheir inalienable right to self-determination. We call \r\non the Security Council to insist on the holding of an \r\nindependent referendum for the Sahrawi people without \r\ndelay, in compliance with the relevant decisions of the \r\nAfrican Union and the relevant resolutions of the United \r\nNations. Furthermore, it is imperative and urgent for the \r\nCouncil to work tirelessly to strengthen its cooperation \r\nwith the African Union Peace and Security Council in \r\nthe search for a just and fair solution to the issue of \r\nWestern Sahara.\r\nClimate change poses a threat to all of humankind, \r\nand its impact respects no borders. We therefore call \r\nfor collective action and responsibility concerning \r\nthe matter. As a developing country, Zimbabwe \r\nseeks support in the areas of adaptation, mitigation, \r\ntechnology, finance and capacity-building, as envisaged \r\nin the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Zimbabwe’s \r\ncommitment to the principles of the Charter and pledge \r\nto continue to work with other nations in promoting \r\nand strengthening multilateralism for the good of \r\nhumankind. Now more than ever, the United Nations \r\nmust exert its authority and work harder for peace in a \r\nworld where might is increasingly regarded as right. Let \r\nus work together in harmony to ensure that the United \r\nNations and all its organs truly serve the collective \r\ninterests of all Member States. As global leaders, we \r\nhave a shared and onerous obligation to transform our \r\nsocieties and create a more peaceful and inclusive world \r\nfor present and future generations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, President \r\nof the Republic of Zimbabwe, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Andrzej Duda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Poland.\r\nMr. Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic \r\nof Poland, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Andrzej Duda, President \r\nof the Republic of Poland, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n22/62 18-29877\r\nPresident Duda (spoke in Polish; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I congratulate \r\nMs. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-third session, on her \r\nelection to that honourable function. I wish to assure \r\nher of Poland’s full support for the measures she will \r\ntake. At the same time, I wish to express my gratitude \r\nto Mr. Miroslav Lajčák for his active leadership of the \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session.\r\nThis year, Poles celebrate the centenary of \r\nregaining their independence. In 1918, after 123 years \r\nof bondage, Poland returned to the map of Europe and \r\nthe world. The restoration of an independent, free and \r\nsovereign State became a reality mainly due to three \r\nfactors: the desire of the Polish nation to have its own \r\nState, the heroic sacrifice of soldiers in battle and the \r\ndetermination of courageous leaders who convinced \r\npoliticians across the world that, without a restored \r\nPoland, Europe would not be just and safe. Both then \r\nand today, the will of the nations and of the political \r\nleaders remains crucial. Both then and today, Europe \r\ncannot be just and safe without a sovereign Poland.\r\nEach September, the Heads of State and Government \r\nmeet here at United Nations Headquarters in New York \r\nto engage in an in-depth reflection on the most crucial \r\nissues affecting our globe. It is therefore we who have \r\na particular responsibility. It is we who are rightly \r\nexpected to be courageous, active, able to rise above \r\ndivisions and determined in our search for solutions to \r\nthe most pressing issues of the contemporary world.\r\nOur world is full of threats. We are witnessing a very \r\ndynamic development of the international situation. \r\nThere are reasons to be hopeful, such as a potential \r\nchange in the situation on the Korean peninsula and \r\nthe ongoing de-escalation of tensions there, but there \r\nare also problems that persist and remain unresolved. \r\nIn order to resolve them, we undoubtedly need the \r\ncooperation of as many countries as possible today. \r\nTwo conditions must be met if we are to be effective.\r\nFirst, we must all comply with international law, \r\nwhich was the main theme of the Polish presidency \r\nof the Security Council in May. I had the privilege of \r\nconvening a high-level open debate at that time (see \r\nS/PV.8262), which concluded that only cooperation \r\namong countries within the rules-based global order \r\ncan provide an opportunity to resolve frozen conflicts \r\nand prevent the emergence of new ones, that the \r\nrules-based global order requires strong institutions \r\nto enforce international law, and that no violation of \r\nthe law can be justified or distorted through twisted \r\nlanguage definitions.\r\nToday the map of the world is full of f lashpoints. \r\nAs part of the rules-based global order that we are \r\npromoting, I would like to draw attention to one \r\nfundamental principle that will be our priority \r\nthroughout the second year of Poland’s membership of \r\nthe Security Council. I am referring to the sovereign \r\nequality of States, as provided for in Article 2 of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. If we want to be \r\nadvocates of multilateralism — and the United Nations \r\nis, after all, its source — we must bear that principle \r\nin mind. In other words, not everyone who claims to \r\nbe a proponent of multilateralism thinks of it in terms \r\nof the equality of States. One can say that there is a \r\nnegative multilateralism, which boils down to the \r\nconcert of Powers, a division into spheres of influence \r\nand the conviction that the fate of others can be decided \r\nwithout their participation. Europe and Poland were \r\noften victims of that brand of multilateralism, starting \r\nin the eighteenth century, continuing throughout the \r\nnineteenth century, and lasting to the times of the \r\nCold War.\r\nMultilateralism and the rules-based global order \r\nare not just for the chosen ones. The same principles \r\nmust apply to all in equal measure. Everyone has \r\nequal rights and proportional obligations. That is \r\nhow I define the positive multilateralism that Poland \r\nstands for — the multilateralism of equal States and \r\nfree nations, not the multilateralism of usurpation and \r\nhierarchy. We are committed to relations in which every \r\nState enjoys equal rights. That, however, does not imply \r\na naive perception of a world devoid of differences \r\namong States. What it means is that States that have an \r\nadvantage in terms of potential and power should not \r\ndeprive others of their equal right to independence and \r\nsovereignty. Only when that equality is ensured can we \r\nfully use the potential of States for the common good \r\nand according to the rule of fair play. That applies both \r\nto political and economic relations, since only if the \r\nprinciple of the equality of States is respected can we \r\ntalk about shared interests and enter into real alliances.\r\nHowever, the concept of positive multilateralism \r\nto which Poland subscribes goes one step further. \r\nIt claims that, wherever possible, weaker countries \r\nshould be given additional opportunities to have an \r\nimpact in order to make the equal rights of States more \r\nrealistic. Such opportunities can encompass additional \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 23/62\r\nvoting power or additional territorial representation in \r\ndecision-making bodies. As President of the Republic \r\nof Poland, I am particularly attached to two areas of \r\napplication of that principle: first, the awaited reform \r\nof the Security Council, which we support and want \r\nto participate in, and which should include among its \r\nleading themes expanding the field of equal rights and \r\ncompetences of all Council members; and secondly, a \r\nreform of the European Union, which emerged from \r\nthe concept of positive multilateralism that today is \r\nbeing repeatedly violated, by returning it to its origins. \r\nNext year, Poland will organize a series of initiatives \r\ncentred around the idea of sovereign equality. The aim \r\nof that effort is to win over as many supporters of our \r\nvision as possible. I invite one and all to participate in \r\nthose debates.\r\nSecondly, it is important that multilateralism serve \r\na certain system of values instead of being just one \r\nelement of a political technology and a game of interests. \r\nSuch a system of values is reflected in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. Negative multilateralism, which \r\ncontravenes those values, may only exacerbate global \r\nproblems and aggravate the situation. On the other \r\nhand, the voluntary cooperation of States, equal in \r\nrights, can bring lasting peace to Europe and the world. \r\nEvery time an attempt to create a concert of Powers \r\nis born, global stability is undermined. Whoever \r\npromotes negative multilateralism contributes to the \r\ndisintegration of the global order. Multilateralism \r\nis meant to be a commitment to respecting values, \r\nespecially fundamental values such as respect for \r\nhuman dignity and life. It is about values that go beyond \r\nthe political order and are not politically defined, for \r\nthey are the foundation of the global order.\r\nInternational relations serve not only States but \r\nall humankind. Therefore, a State’s sovereignty should \r\nbe fundamentally linked to its responsibility for \r\nensuring respect for common norms for the good of all. \r\nViolations of those norms must have consequences. \r\nWhenever leaders violate fundamental human rights, \r\nengage in torture, persecute their political opponents \r\nor use weapons of mass destruction, the international \r\ncommunity, including the Security Council, should \r\nrespond swiftly, decisively and boldly.\r\nAs a nation with unique experience of a peaceful \r\ndemocratic transformation and a struggle for \r\nfundamental freedoms, Poland attaches particular \r\nimportance to the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights, as exemplified by my country’s bid \r\nfor membership of the Human Rights Council for the \r\n2020-2022 term. Our membership of that body, which \r\nis unique in the global human rights protection system, \r\nwould serve as a natural complement to our current \r\nmembership of the Security Council, in accordance \r\nwith the fundamental United Nations triad of peace and \r\nsecurity, human rights and development.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations endows the \r\nOrganization, especially the Security Council, with a \r\nspecial responsibility for addressing matters pertaining \r\nto international peace and security. As a non-permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council, we deem that task to \r\nbe of crucial importance. Poland actively supports all \r\nactions and initiatives aimed at preventing the use and \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their \r\nmeans of delivery, as well as bringing those who use \r\nsuch weapons to justice.\r\nPoland intends to return to active participation \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping missions. We have \r\nsubmitted a formal application to the Secretariat in \r\nthat regard and look forward to its positive evaluation. \r\nWe are convinced that our many years of experience \r\nin that field will contribute to the peaceful resolution \r\nof conflicts.\r\nPoland is involved in the process of stabilizing \r\nthe Korean peninsula and building lasting security \r\nthere — not only now, in its capacity as a non-permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council, but also as a member \r\nfor dozens of years of the Neutral Nations Supervisory \r\nCommission in Korea. I am convinced that our long-\r\nterm experience within the Commission could serve to \r\nestablish permanent foundations for peace and stability \r\non the peninsula.\r\nGiven the extensive experience it accumulated \r\nduring the period of political transformation, Poland \r\nstands ready to become actively engaged in the \r\ninternational peace rebuilding and consolidation \r\nprogrammes in the Middle East, wherever it is \r\nnecessary, post-conflict, to restore stability and provide \r\ndevelopment opportunities.\r\nAt the same time, Poland regards it as its duty to \r\ndraw the attention of the international community to \r\nthe sources of threats to world peace resulting from \r\nfrozen conflicts, occupation and the shifting of borders \r\nby force, which is happening in Eastern Europe. The \r\ninternational community must not allow a return to \r\nbusiness as usual, and the actions of the aggressors \r\nshould be met with an appropriate response.\r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n24/62 18-29877\r\nIn December, Poland will have the honour to host the \r\ntwenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange (COP 24) in the city of Katowice. The primary \r\ngoal of that meeting is to finalize work on the provisions \r\nimplementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \r\nA complete and effective implementation of the Paris \r\nAgreement is inextricably linked with the attainment of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, global \r\nclimate action should incorporate the economic, social \r\nand environmental dimensions, and be conducive to \r\nstopping global warming and eradicating the most \r\nserious problems of the modern world.\r\nThe implementation package to be adopted in \r\nKatowice provides an essential basis for action to \r\nbe taken by State entities and non-governmental \r\norganizations, including international financial \r\ninstitutions, the private sector, local authorities and \r\ncivil society organizations. Only provisions applicable \r\nin the long-term and accepted by all actors are able \r\nto guarantee transparency, legal security and the \r\nsustainability of rules, which are indispensable to the \r\nimplementation of the adopted obligations and for \r\nstrengthening global ambitions.\r\nCOP 24 will be launched at a summit of leaders, to \r\nbe held on 3 and 4 December, and offers an excellent \r\nopportunity to express our common and responsible \r\npolitical will. It will also send a clear message to the \r\nworld that our efforts are aimed at securing a safe \r\nfuture for all. Once again, I wish to invite all Member \r\nStates to attend the Katowice summit and ensure a high \r\nturnout for the event.\r\nThe centenary of Poland’s recovery of its \r\nindependence leads us to reflect on the fate of Europe \r\nand the world and on my country’s difficult road to \r\nfreedom and independence. It also provides a reason to \r\nlook to the future and an inspiration to sensibly shape \r\nour common international reality based on historical \r\nexperiences, values and aspirations. I encourage all \r\nMember States to collaborate even more closely on \r\ninitiatives aimed at achieving the objectives that guide \r\nthe Organization. Only decisions taken jointly by \r\npolitical leaders can effectively address the challenges \r\nfaced by a globalized world.\r\nPoland subscribes to the view that our common \r\nfuture requires a strong and effective international \r\ncommunity that will better accommodate the needs of \r\nhumankind. That, however, will depend mainly on us, \r\nsince the United Nations is not an abstract entity but \r\nour common achievement. It is up to us how effective \r\nwe will be in using it for the sake of building peace \r\nand ensuring justice and sustainable development — in \r\nother words, building a better world, worthy of the \r\ntwenty-first century, for us and, first and foremost, for \r\nfuture generations, our children and our grandchildren.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Poland for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic \r\nof Poland, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, President \r\nof the Portuguese Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Portuguese Republic.\r\nMr. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, President of the \r\nPortuguese Republic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, \r\nPresident of the Portuguese Republic, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rebelo de Sousa (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation): \r\nI convey very special congratulations to Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés on her election to preside \r\nover the General Assembly. I congratulate her on her \r\npersonality and career, on the priorities she has defined, \r\non the progress she represents in gender equality at \r\nthe United Nations and on the informal interactive \r\ndialogue, which is a sign of the increased transparency \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nPortugal welcomes and reaffirms its full support \r\nfor the priorities the Secretary-General has set and \r\nthe actions he has pursued during his lucid, dynamic \r\nand exceptional mandate. Multilateralism, based on \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nthe reform of the Organization, conflict prevention, \r\npeacekeeping and the maintenance of peace, concern \r\nfor migration and refugees, combating terrorism and \r\ninternational crime, the oceans and maritime security, \r\nclimate change, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, gender equality and support for our \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 25/62\r\nyoung people are all aimed at the permanent upholding \r\nof human rights.\r\nThe key is always strengthened multilateralism. \r\nThat is why we do not understand — and in fact \r\ndeplore — the use of unilateralism as a way to disinvest \r\nin international organizations. It represents political \r\nshort-sightedness that runs the risk of making us \r\nrepeat the mistakes that were made almost a century \r\nago. United Nations reform requires the commitment \r\nof all Member States. Maintaining the status quo is a \r\nway of gutting multilateralism and, in the absence of \r\nprevention, multiplying risks and conflicts, resulting in \r\nunderdevelopment and the violation of human rights. \r\nAnd if we fail to reform the Security Council through a \r\nbroad-based consensus we ignore the geopolitics of the \r\ntwenty-first century, which at the very least requires \r\nthe inclusion of representatives of the continent of \r\nAfrica, Brazil and India.\r\nPortugal is a participant in conflict-prevention, \r\npeacebuilding, peacekeeping and institutional capacity-\r\nbuilding operations in nine United Nations missions, \r\nsix of which are in Africa. I would particularly like \r\nto highlight our presence in the United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in \r\nthe Central African Republic and in the United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission \r\nin Mali.\r\nWith respect to migration and refugees, we \r\nneed to understand the causes of the growth in mass \r\nmovements of people, and we need dialogue among \r\nsocieties of origin, transit and destination. Portugal \r\nunreservedly supports the global compact for safe, \r\norderly and regular migration, the global compact on \r\nrefugees and the promotion of the right to education \r\nin emergency situations. We have welcomed and will \r\ncontinue to welcome migrants, refugees and other \r\ndisplaced persons. Under our former President Jorge \r\nSampaio, my country launched the Global Platform \r\nfor Syrian Students and calls for the broadest possible \r\nparticipation in the Rapid Response Mechanism for \r\nHigher Education in Emergencies.\r\nThe fight against terrorism has led to the creation \r\nof the Office of Counter-Terrorism, the first United \r\nNations High-level Conference of Heads of Counter-\r\nTerrorism Agencies of Member States and a sixth \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy \r\nReview (resolution 72/284). The guarantee of justice for \r\nvictims of serious international crimes is now one of the \r\ntasks of the International Criminal Court, which began \r\nto consider the crime of aggression in 2017, following a \r\ndecision in which Portugal played an active role. With \r\nthe support of more Member States, the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich created the Court, is expected to move towards \r\nuniversal adoption.\r\nWith regard to multilateralism and international \r\nlaw in the area of oceans and maritime security, \r\nPortugal is actively involved in preparations for the \r\nsecond United Nations Ocean Conference, in 2020, and \r\nstands ready to assume all responsibilities related to \r\nthat. Maritime security is needed in places such as the \r\ncoast of Somalia or the Gulf of Guinea, where Portugal \r\nis part of the European Union Naval Force Operation \r\nAtalanta within the framework of the European Union, \r\nand also in the Yaoundé process, together with the \r\nAfrican Union and the countries of the region. And \r\nwe are going further, creating a centre in the Azores \r\nas a platform for various international organizations \r\nworking to protect the oceans. Global governance of the \r\noceans, supported by the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, is a just cause. For \r\nus, those are structural issues that we do not change to \r\nsuit short-term trends and actors. We regard a healthy \r\nenvironment as a fundamental right; we support carbon \r\nneutrality by 2050 and, with Lebanon, we are jointly \r\nchairing the ad hoc open-ended working group with a \r\nview to drafting a global pact for the environment.\r\nThere are basically two different views of the \r\nworld. One is short-term. It is unilateral or minilateral, \r\nprotectionist and focused on populist domestic discourse. \r\nIt minimizes the importance of multilateralism in \r\nanything to do with sustainable development, is prone \r\nto climate change denial, opposes global compacts on \r\nmigration and refugees and is interested in conflict \r\nprevention and peacekeeping on the rare occasions \r\nwhen and where they suit it, and they are more likely \r\nto suit it when the emphasis is on economic rather than \r\npolitical power. The opposing view, which we share, \r\nis multilateral, open, favourable to the quest for global \r\ngovernance, committed to sustainable development and \r\nrespectful of international law, the Charter of the United \r\nNations and human rights as values and principles, not \r\nas means or conveniences. We are confident that, in \r\nthe medium to long term, that view will prevail, as it \r\nhas in the European Union, which has given Europe \r\nits longest period of peace in living memory and high \r\nlevels of welfare and social protection.\r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n26/62 18-29877\r\nAs we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the \r\nInternational Law Commission, it is an appropriate time \r\nto call for consensus on the adoption of the biennial \r\nresolution on the moratorium on the death penalty, \r\nwhich is to be submitted to the General Assembly.\r\nOur view of the global situation and the role of \r\nthe United Nations, which, as I said, is in complete \r\nagreement with the view of the Secretary-General, \r\nis based on our positions on those so-called regional \r\nquestions that are global in scope. Let me now comment \r\non some that are of particular relevance to Portugal.\r\nWe salute the strengthening of the Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP) — currently \r\nchaired by Cabo Verde, to be followed by Angola — whose \r\ncontributions to stability and development I want to \r\nhighlight. The CPLP enjoys an excellent cooperative \r\nrelationship with the United Nations and pursues the \r\ngoal of seeing the Portuguese language, one of the \r\nmost widely spoken in the world, adopted as an official \r\nlanguage of the United Nations.\r\nWe also commend the steps that have been taken \r\nin Guinea-Bissau in preparation for elections in \r\nNovember. We would like to highlight the increasing \r\nimportance of the African Union and its key uniting \r\nrole for peace and sustainable development, its growing \r\npartnership with the United Nations and the historic \r\nstep of the signing of the Joint Declaration of Peace and \r\nFriendship between Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is our hope \r\nthat the elections in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo will be held in a safe, free and fair manner and \r\nthat the results be respected by all.\r\nThe important developments on the Korean \r\npeninsula are opening up the prospects for its \r\ncomplete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization, \r\ndemonstrating the commitment and courage of the \r\nparties involved, the contributions of regional partners \r\nof the United Nations and, above all, the role of \r\ndiplomacy in bringing about world peace and security.\r\nWe note the signing of the maritime-boundary \r\ntreaty between Australia and Timor-Leste under the \r\nauspices of the Secretary-General, confirming the \r\neffectiveness of the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nthrough conciliation under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nUnfortunately, some parts of the Middle East and \r\nthe Maghreb continue to show signs of long-term \r\npolitical, social and economic instability. In Libya, the \r\ninternational community must come together to assist \r\nwith the humanitarian and security situation and in \r\nestablishing a robust State. Yemen remains the scene \r\nof one of the worst humanitarian crises today, where \r\nthe most vulnerable — women and children — are \r\nespecially badly affected. Only through a negotiated \r\npolitical solution mediated by the United Nations and \r\nwith respect for international humanitarian law can we \r\nreverse that increasingly tragic situation.\r\nMr. Bahr Aluloom (Iraq), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nEqually tragic is the humanitarian crisis in \r\nSyria, with one of the largest refugee f lows ever \r\nseen in the region or beyond. In that case, too, only a \r\nsubstantive, inclusive political solution mediated by the \r\nUnited Nations can ensure effective and broad-based \r\ninternational support for reconstruction. The fact is that \r\nstability and peace in the Middle East will be possible \r\nonly through the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict. Common sense demands the resumption of \r\na credible negotiation process that addresses all the \r\nfinal-status issues, including the question of Jerusalem, \r\nand can lead to a viable two-State solution based on the \r\ncoexistence of Israel and Palestine in peace and security.\r\nAs the Secretary-General suggested yesterday, true \r\npatriotism and cosmopolitanism are complementary. \r\nPortugal believes that multilateral action, political \r\ndialogue and diplomatic wisdom are the only possible \r\npath to harmonious coexistence among nations and \r\npeoples, and that very short-term perspectives, however \r\nappealing they may seem, are just a f lash in the pan that \r\nwill not last and will not solve the world’s true problems.\r\nAs Nelson Mandela said,\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“A fundamental concern for others in our \r\nindividual and community lives would go a long \r\nway in making the world the better place we so \r\npassionately dreamt of.”\r\nThat is the Organization’s noble mission; it is also \r\nthe reason for Portugal’s deep commitment to the \r\nUnited Nations. The United Nations represents neither \r\na luxury nor a short-sighted trend, but rather a long-\r\nlasting universal need.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 27/62\r\nof the Portuguese Republic for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, President of the \r\nPortuguese Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Salvador Sánchez Cerén, President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of El Salvador.\r\nMr. Salvador Sánchez Cerén, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Salvador \r\nSánchez Cerén, President of the Republic of El Salvador, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Sánchez Cerén (spoke in Spanish): I \r\ncongratulate Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés, \r\nour Latin American sister, on her election to preside \r\nover the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. \r\nI also want to pay tribute to Kofi Annan, whose \r\ncommendable work at the helm of the United Nations \r\nleft us a great legacy in the defence of peace and a \r\nfairer international economic order. And I would like \r\nto express the condolences of El Salvador on the recent \r\ndeath of the President of the Republic of Viet Nam, Tran \r\nDai Quang. We also want to express our solidarity with \r\nthe Government and the people of the United States \r\nfor the effects of Hurricane Florence and those in the \r\nPhilippines and China who have been affected by the \r\ndevastating climate events in their countries.\r\nThis year brings us together under the theme \r\n“Making the United Nations relevant to all people: \r\nglobal leadership and shared responsibilities for \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies”. It is our \r\nresponsibility to reach out to all, without discrimination \r\nof any kind, with intelligent and effective public policies \r\nand tools that meet the needs and aspirations of our \r\npeople. That has been a priority for El Salvador during \r\nmy Administration. The social protection programmes \r\nwe have promoted were decisive in lifting more than \r\n400,000 people out of poverty between 2015 and 2017. \r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has \r\nbecome a crucial reference point for the implementation \r\nof our national policies. We were among the earliest \r\ncountries to adapt the 2030 Agenda to its purpose of \r\nmitigating the consequences of decades of serious \r\nsocial inequality and repairing the State’s historical \r\nlack of interest in the needs and demands of the people.\r\nEl Salvador joins the call of Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres regarding the urgent need to close the \r\ngaps in the financing of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. To that end, we have allocated nearly 50 per \r\ncent of the national budget to social development, an \r\nunprecedented investment for my country. But even \r\nwith all of our efforts, our national financing will \r\nnot be sufficient. The international community must \r\nalso honour its commitments in this regard. Those \r\ncontributions must respond to a comprehensive, long-\r\nterm perspective in order to ensure inclusive economic \r\ngrowth and end poverty for the millions of people who \r\nare suffering the worst consequences of climate change \r\nand the unfair distribution of wealth. In the case of \r\nmiddle-income countries such as El Salvador, the key \r\nlies in supporting and supplementing our financing \r\ncapacities, particularly from public sources.\r\nOur country is dealing with multiple vulnerabilities. \r\nWe recently suffered one of the longest droughts \r\nin our history, a reality that climate change has \r\ninflicted on us. That obliges us to invest additional \r\nresources in order to guarantee families food security \r\nand keep food prices stable. If we are to tackle that \r\nsituation, it is crucial to ensure that the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change continues \r\nto be implemented and the current Green Climate Fund \r\ncrisis is resolved. As a country that hardly pollutes \r\nglobally but suffers the effects of climate change \r\ncaused by others, El Salvador urgently needs access to \r\nfinancing for climate-change mitigation and adaptation \r\naction that will improve its population’s security and \r\nresilience. Our adoption in Bonn of a global initiative \r\nat the twenty-third Conference of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change has enabled \r\nus to move forward with the large-scale restoration of \r\nour ecosystems and to become an example of a small \r\ncountry with limited financial resources capable of \r\nprotecting its environment. I am deeply grateful to \r\nMr. Erik Solheim, Executive Director of the United \r\nNations Environment Programme, for supporting our \r\nproposal to declare 2021-2030 a United Nations decade of \r\necosystem restoration. We invite the General Assembly \r\nto consider this initiative aimed at coordinating our \r\nefforts to counter the accelerated loss of forests and \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n28/62 18-29877\r\nthe degradation of soils and ecosystems, which have a \r\nnegative effect on the well-being of 3.2 billion people.\r\nAs one of the Heads of State who in 2015 adopted \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at a \r\nmemorable and historic General Assembly meeting \r\n(see A/70/PV.4), today I can affirm that we have made \r\ngreat progress in combating poverty and reducing \r\ninequalities. My Government has given priority to social \r\nprotection programmes through development strategies \r\nthat enabled us to reduce poverty by 10 per cent between \r\n2009 and 2017. Through our critical national literacy \r\nprogramme we have declared 100 municipalities free \r\nof illiteracy, including San Salvador, which became \r\nthe third Central American capital to record that \r\neducational achievement. That effort continues with \r\nour firm commitment to achieving a literate country, \r\na noble task in which we have the generous support \r\nof more than 50,000 young volunteers, advocates and \r\nother sectors of society. The support of the people and \r\nGovernment of our sister Republic of Cuba has been \r\nessential to that success. Its Yo Sí Puedo campaign is a \r\nmodel for the eradication of illiteracy to Latin America \r\nand the world.\r\nAs part of our defence of women’s rights, we \r\nhave developed a strategy for the prevention of the \r\nkilling of women and sexual violence that involves \r\nall Government institutions in empowering women \r\nand ensuring that they can live free of violence. The \r\nstrategy, which has been strengthened by the Spotlight \r\nInitiative with support from the European Union and \r\nthe United Nations, seeks to eradicate social and \r\ninstitutional practices that are damaging to women’s \r\ndignity. We have also strengthened the internationally \r\nrecognized Ciudad Mujer programme, which has been \r\nimplemented in several countries and has provided \r\ncare to more than 1.8 million women through health \r\nservices, defence of women’s rights, skills training and \r\nfinancing for economic projects. On the health front, \r\nthe implementation of our national strategic plan for the \r\nreduction of maternal mortality stands out, as well as \r\nour national health surveillance plan. Both have helped \r\nEl Salvador reduce its maternal mortality rate, which in \r\n2017 dropped to 31 per 100,000 live births.\r\nIn our pursuit of those urgent efforts we have \r\nthe spiritual guidance, the message of peace and the \r\npromotion of social justice of blessed Archbishop Óscar \r\nArnulfo Romero, who on 14 October will be canonized \r\nby Pope Francis, a historic event that our people are \r\ncelebrating with profound joy and hope.\r\nA topic of special relevance at the global and \r\nregional levels is migration. My country looks forward \r\nto welcoming the prompt adoption of the global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration and \r\nthe global compact on refugees as clear examples of \r\nthe leading role of the United Nations in the search for \r\na new global consensus. We must approach migration \r\nfrom a human rights perspective in order to realize \r\nits benefits and address the challenges it represents. \r\nThis year many migrant families, mainly from the \r\nnorthern-triangle countries of Central America, have \r\nbeen dealing with the difficult and painful situation of \r\nseparation, which has caused irreparable psychological \r\nand emotional damage to the children and adolescents \r\ninvolved. We believe that the best interests of children \r\nand their families should be respected, regardless \r\nof their immigration status. I reiterate El Salvador’s \r\nrequest to the United States authorities to speed up \r\nthe reunification process for minors entering their \r\ncountry at its southern border, whether or not they were \r\naccompanied by their families.\r\nIn recent years, El Salvador has worked to create \r\nbetter living conditions through the promotion of \r\ninvestment, the development of human capital, security, \r\nthe prevention of violence and the fight against \r\ncriminal trafficking networks and drug trafficking, \r\namong other initiatives, actions that have enabled us \r\nto reduce irregular migratory f lows of Salvadorans to \r\nthe United States by 60 per cent. El Salvador rejects \r\nthe criminalization of migrants, since experience \r\nhas shown that their industriousness contributes to \r\nthe economic, social and cultural development of \r\ndestination societies. Our compatriots protected by the \r\nTemporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action \r\nfor Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programmes, who for \r\nyears have contributed to progress in the United States, \r\nare a clear example of that. As a Government we are \r\nworking to make sure that the competent United States \r\nauthorities guarantee the legal instruments required \r\nto provide the population in the United States under \r\nTPS and DACA with greater migratory stability and \r\npermanent residence.\r\nAs a founding State of the United Nations and a \r\ncountry respectful of international law, El Salvador \r\nrecognizes the importance of multilateralism in \r\naddressing such global challenges as peace, a more \r\njust economic order, climate change, migration and \r\nsustainable development. In that context, we stress \r\nthe need for constructive dialogue, concerted action \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 29/62\r\nand cooperation and the strengthening of integration \r\nmechanisms and regional alliances. In the face of crises \r\nand conflicts affecting the world, it is important to give \r\npriority to dialogue and political solutions. That was our \r\napproach on 30 June in Santo Domingo, at the Meeting \r\nof Presidents of the Central American Integration \r\nSystem countries, where we stated our position on \r\nthe situation in our sister republic of Nicaragua. We \r\nreiterate the call for dialogue and consensus as the \r\nnecessary paths for the construction and maintenance \r\nof peace, with respect for the Constitution and the rule \r\nof law.\r\nIn order for the international community to make \r\nsteady progress towards development, we must put \r\nan end to unilateral measures such as the unjust and \r\nanachronistic economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba by the United States. \r\nThat coercive measure must end because it causes \r\nincalculable harm to the Cuban people. The same goes \r\nfor the economic siege against the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela, which affects its international payments \r\nand its ability to obtain goods and services, as well as its \r\npeople’s living conditions. We stand for respect for the \r\nself-determination and sovereignty of the Venezuelan \r\npeople and condemn any external interference or \r\nthreats of military intervention.\r\nI thank the United Nations system and Secretary-\r\nGeneral António Guterres for the valuable support they \r\nprovide to our development programmes for the well-\r\nbeing and tranquillity of Salvadoran families. We are \r\nalso grateful for their assistance in and support for a \r\nnational dialogue process towards the development \r\nof new national agreements, a continuation of the \r\npeace accords that we signed in January 1992. I \r\nreaffirm El Salvador’s commitment to helping make \r\nthe work of the United Nations relevant to all people \r\nand to global leadership, with a view to advancing \r\nhumankind’s aspiration to achieve peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies. My Government continues to \r\nwork tirelessly to that end. We are confident that with \r\nthe commitments we have undertaken to fulfil the 2030 \r\nAgenda, we are moving forward with the building of a \r\nunited, prosperous and peaceful El Salvador.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Salvador Sánchez Cerén, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of \r\nthe Republic of Nauru\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Nauru.\r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Baron \r\nDivavesi Waqa, President of the Republic of Nauru, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Waqa: It is an honour to be here for the \r\nopening of the General Assembly at its seventy-third \r\nsession. On behalf of the Republic of Nauru, I would \r\nlike to congratulate Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa \r\nGarcés on her recent assumption of the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly and to thank Mr. Miroslav Lajčák \r\nfor his exceptional work as our outgoing President.\r\nThe theme chosen for this year’s debate — “Making \r\nthe United Nations relevant to all people” — is deeply \r\nresonant for this representative of a small island \r\ndeveloping State (SIDS). It is so self-evident that it \r\nborders on cliché to state that some communities have \r\nnot benefited from the current global economic system. \r\nYet it bears repeating again and again lest those places \r\nbe forgotten entirely. The Republic of Nauru is one \r\nsuch place, and it is to the United Nations that we look \r\nfor assistance. However, to be responsive to the needs \r\nof my country and many others like it, we must address \r\na systemic bias within the United Nations and start \r\nthinking small.\r\nThe population of Nauru is a little over 10,000. \r\nLet me try to capture some of the challenges we \r\nencounter in accessing the support available from the \r\nUnited Nations by sharing a story from my days as the \r\ncountry’s Director of Education. Eager to participate \r\nin an education-data tracking programme offered by \r\nUNESCO, I logged onto its website and began to input \r\nthe required information for registering my country. \r\nThe first question was straightforward: number of \r\nprimary schools. I typed in the number 6 — not 600, \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n30/62 18-29877\r\nnot 6,000, but “6” — and the response read “error”. I \r\nmoved on to the second question: number of teachers. I \r\ntyped in 59 — “error” again. I was not able to register \r\nfor that promising education programme. But I did \r\nlearn an important lesson that day. It is not easy to gain \r\naccess to support from the United Nations system when \r\none is representing a small country.\r\nOur unique challenges as SIDS are widely \r\nrecognized. Some are inherent in the geophysical nature \r\nof the islands we inhabit, such as a small land mass, \r\nlimited natural resources, geographic isolation and \r\nvulnerability to natural disasters. No less important are \r\nthe challenges imposed on us by the global economic \r\nsystem, which was not designed with our countries \r\nin mind. Our small populations and production base \r\ndo not yield the economies of scale sought by private \r\ninvestors. Volatility in commodity markets has an \r\noutsize impact on our fiscal planning. The negative \r\nexternalities of consumption-based economic growth \r\nhave destroyed the health of our oceans and the safety \r\nof our climate.\r\nMeanwhile, corporate consolidation and a \r\nliberalized global financial system translate into \r\nfewer and fewer opportunities for small enterprises to \r\ndevelop domestically. That leaves us with extremely \r\nunderdeveloped economies, overly reliant on one or \r\ntwo key sectors that are often highly vulnerable to \r\nchanging global market trends or shifts in the political \r\npriorities of our development partners. SIDS typically \r\nscore extremely high on economic vulnerability indices \r\nfor that reason, and Nauru is no different. While today \r\nwe may be considered a middle-income country under \r\ncertain metrics, our economic situation could change \r\ndramatically for the worse overnight owing to forces \r\nthat are completely out of our hands.\r\nThose observations are not new. We have been \r\ngrappling with such challenges for decades. But in the \r\nface of climate change, developing effective strategies \r\nfor dealing with them has become much more urgent. I \r\nthink it is fair to say that the logic of the entire global \r\neconomic system is driven by a relentless pursuit of \r\nlarger and larger scale. In the name of efficiency, private \r\nenterprises expand operations in places with large pools \r\nof cheap labour or vast reserves of resources. They \r\nmerge with competitors to increase market share. They \r\nseek out the greatest profit centres and abandon those \r\nthat underperform. Talk to any newly minted graduate \r\nwith a master’s degree in business administration about \r\na new business idea, and the first question he or she \r\nwill ask is “Does it scale?” I dare say that that logic has \r\npermeated the United Nations system. Why design a \r\nprogramme to help a country of 10,000 people when one \r\ncan theoretically help 10 million? Why wade through all \r\nthe loan paperwork to replace a small diesel generator \r\nwhen the same number of documents can mobilize \r\nfunding to transform a much larger energy system? If \r\nmy country is too small to even warrant inclusion in a \r\nsimple online database, where does that leave us?\r\nFor the smallest countries, the micro-States, \r\nconventional pathways to development are not available \r\nto us. We simply cannot offer the profit potential that \r\nprivate investors seek. We must therefore look to public \r\ninstitutions — to the United Nations — to create an \r\nenvironment in which the rest of us can grow and \r\nprosper. The Republic of Nauru cannot be treated as an \r\n“error”. When viewed through the lens of conventional \r\neconomics, our lack of scale is our problem. If we are \r\nto address the challenges of small islands, therefore, we \r\nhave to abandon the conventional wisdom. We have to \r\nthink about scale differently. Once we take that leap, \r\nour small size can become our greatest advantage.\r\nEarlier this month, Nauru had the honour to host \r\nthe forty-ninth Pacific Islands Forum Leaders meeting. \r\nThe theme of the meeting — “Building a strong Pacific: \r\nour people, our islands, our will” — was chosen \r\nto highlight the uniqueness of our region and the \r\nimperative that we chart our own course to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Traditional and new partners alike joined \r\nus at the Pacific region’s first round table on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 17 to announce new initiatives in \r\nthe areas of energy, health care and protection of the \r\noceans. The event was successful because our partners \r\nrecognized the opportunities in our small islands. \r\nThe countries that demonstrated no respect for the \r\nsovereignty of the small and vulnerable or for the \r\nleaders of the Pacific and the regional process were \r\nrespectfully asked to yield the f loor to those that did.\r\nSmall can be nimble. Small means that modest \r\nresources can have a transformative impact. When \r\nour sustainability metrics are aggregated with those of \r\nthe rest of the world, we become nothing more than a \r\nrounding error. But when joined by partners that are \r\nprepared to understand our constraints, we can become \r\nliving proof that a better, more sustainable way of \r\nlife is possible. With regard to renewable energy, for \r\nexample, a few small islands have made enormous \r\nprogress in the past few years and are looking to \r\nachieve 100 per cent renewable-energy systems within \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 31/62\r\na decade, a tremendous achievement. That is a much \r\nmore difficult undertaking in large countries, which \r\nmust serve population centres spread across a much \r\nwider geographical area, navigate a minefield of \r\npolitically powerful incumbents and bear much higher \r\nfinancial costs.\r\nWe can see some of our Pacific island neighbours \r\nracing to the front, with the rest of us clamouring to \r\nfollow their lead. We are ready to seize the opportunity \r\npresented by cheap solar energy and free ourselves \r\nfrom the expensive burden of fossil fuels. Capacity \r\nand resource constraints are the only things holding \r\nus back. My Government’s own analysis puts the cost \r\nof moving Nauru to 100 per cent renewable energy at \r\n$63 million. For a modest investment, the world would \r\nhave visible evidence that the future we want — a clean, \r\nzero-carbon society — is well within our grasp. That \r\ntransformation would also dramatically improve our \r\nfiscal outlook, providing a much stronger foundation \r\nfor progress in other areas of sustainable development.\r\nJust because the task is smaller does not mean \r\nit is easy. But there are simple steps to be taken that \r\nwould dramatically improve our situation. Financial \r\nand capacity-building resources need to be made more \r\naccessible for our capacity-constrained countries. \r\nStreamlined and harmonized application and reporting \r\nprocedures would significantly alleviate one of our \r\nlargest hurdles. In addition, new funding approaches, \r\nsuch as direct-access modalities and direct budgetary \r\nsupport, seem to yield much better results in small \r\ncountries. Adequate financing must be available for \r\nbasic infrastructure, not just for the development fads \r\nof the moment. The Pacific region’s partnership with \r\nthe Government of Italy has been a resounding success \r\nbecause it has been structured with those issues in \r\nmind. The model works because it regards the Pacific \r\nislands as the primary drivers of their own development. \r\nWhen working with the Government of Italy we know \r\nthat the tremendous respect that they have shown us has \r\nnothing to do with the size of our countries.\r\nBuilding a more inclusive United Nations also \r\nrequires addressing the most urgent global challenges, \r\nwhich include the security implications of climate \r\nchange. In that regard, I would like to reiterate the \r\ncall I made in July in the Security Council for the \r\nappointment of a special representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on climate and security (see S/PV.8307). We \r\nare already seeing dangerous effects on our countries \r\nand communities, with the most vulnerable among us \r\nbearing the greatest burden. A special representative, \r\nsupported by a well-resourced staff, is needed to help \r\nus start managing climate risks more effectively. That \r\nis a critical gap in the United Nations system that must \r\nbe filled immediately.\r\nMaking the United Nations relevant to all people \r\nmust include the people of Taiwan. The treatment of \r\nthe people of Taiwan should be equal to that of other \r\nnations. The United Nations should resolve the serious \r\nissue of the exclusion of Taiwan’s 23 million people \r\nfrom the United Nations system. The Preamble to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations clearly states that the \r\nOrganization’s mission is\r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, \r\nin the dignity and worth of the human person, in \r\nthe equal rights of men and women and of nations \r\nlarge and small”.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank the Governments \r\nof Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, Japan, India, the \r\nRussian Federation, Italy, Israel and Cuba, as well as \r\nthe European Union for their assistance to Nauru. We \r\nvalue their friendship very much and look forward to \r\nour continued collaboration.\r\nWe applaud the President for choosing to promote \r\na theme of inclusion in this debate. In the pursuit of \r\nscale, it is easy to forget that many of the smallest \r\nand most vulnerable often fall through the cracks. \r\nMy Government stands ready to work with her during \r\nthe seventy-third session of the General Assembly to \r\nbuild a United Nations that brings peace and equitable \r\nand sustainable societies to all people. God bless the \r\nRepublic of Nauru. God bless the United Nations. God \r\nbless us all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Nauru for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional \r\nPresident of the Plurinational State of Bolivia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Constitutional \r\nPresident of the Plurinational State of Bolivia.\r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n32/62 18-29877\r\nMr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional President \r\nof the Plurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional President of \r\nthe Plurinational State of Bolivia, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Morales Ayma (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nthe President of the General Assembly on her recent \r\nelection to her important post.\r\nThe men, women and children of every continent \r\nin the world throughout our shared home, planet \r\nEarth, hope that our deliberations will bring concrete \r\nimprovements to their lives. The world sees its leaders \r\nmeet once a year and continues to hope that we will \r\ncollaborate in complying fully with our mandate to \r\nbuild a more just society for all. When the United \r\nNations was created, after the Second World War, it \r\nestablished clear purposes that now serve as a measure \r\nof our triumphs, failures, threats and opportunities. We \r\nsought to maintain international peace, security and \r\njustice, prevent and eliminate threats and suppress acts \r\nof aggression. We sought to resolve our disagreements \r\nby peaceful means and to foster friendly relations \r\namong nations based on respect for the principles of \r\nequal rights and the self-determination of peoples.\r\nThe theme of the general debate this year — “Making \r\nthe United Nations relevant to all people: global \r\nleadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, \r\nequitable and sustainable societies” — allows me to \r\ncite a practical provision of the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, which is that \r\nMember States\r\n“shall settle their international disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans in such a manner that international peace \r\nand security, and justice, are not endangered”.\r\nI am referring here to the proceedings that Bolivia \r\nhas brought before the International Court of Justice \r\nin The Hague, whose decision will be announced \r\nnext week. The case deals with Chile’s obligation \r\nto negotiate with Bolivia in an effective and timely \r\nmanner on sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. It \r\ntests the shared responsibility of two States to agree \r\non just solutions within the framework of international \r\nlaw. The Court asserted its jurisdiction to hear and \r\nresolve that international disagreement in 2015, \r\nwhose hemispheric interest was recognized by the \r\nOrganization of American States because it involves \r\ntwo neighbours and undermines efforts to achieve \r\nthe regional integration of peoples. Bolivia’s goal is \r\nthe good-faith achievement, together with Chile, of a \r\ndurable, sustainable and mutually satisfactory solution \r\nto a 100-year conflict that has put two neighbouring \r\ncountries at odds.\r\nIts worst consequence is that Bolivia has been \r\na landlocked country, with its people and the State \r\ndeprived of access to the Pacific Ocean, a state of affairs \r\nthat has severely affected our human and economic \r\ndevelopment and continues to do so. Bolivia’s maritime \r\nsuit is related to its understanding of diplomacy as \r\nworking for the people, their life and their right to access \r\nto the sea and its vast resources, the largest setting for \r\nlife on the planet and the shared heritage of humankind \r\nand its peoples. Human beings are supported by the sea. \r\nLife on Earth is not possible without water, and it is \r\nnot possible to think about the lives of people without \r\naccess to the sea. Not only is it a door to trade, markets \r\nand modern transactions, it is also a window on other \r\npeoples and on life itself.\r\nWe hope that the legal proceedings that have been \r\nbrought before the International Court of Justice will be \r\nrecognized and will help to bring the parties closer to \r\nthe start of productive negotiations. We also hope that to \r\nthe extent possible, with the support of the international \r\ncommunity, it will help us to reach a genuine agreement \r\nthat honestly outlines the causes and effects of the \r\nconflict that has driven us apart for more than a \r\ncentury. The agreement should also critically examine \r\nthe inadequacy of the agreements and attempts to \r\novercome Bolivia’s landlocked status, while validating \r\nand illustrating the reciprocal advantages of timely and \r\neffective agreements in the context of the principles \r\nof regional and global integration and reconciling two \r\npeoples engaged in an absurd conflict, often for reasons \r\nthat are alien to their values of brotherly coexistence.\r\nThe conflict between Bolivia and Chile over \r\naccess to the Pacific Ocean is not the result of a recent \r\nor passing political or electoral issue. It goes back to \r\nthe very origins of our territorial dispute at the end of \r\nthe nineteenth century, when the interests of foreign \r\ncorporations seeking to exploit the natural resources \r\nof the Atacama area, such as guano, potassium nitrate, \r\nsilver and copper, launched a hostile, asymmetric and \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 33/62\r\nexpansionist campaign in the region. The landlocked \r\nstatus imposed on Bolivia could not be remedied \r\nthrough treaties that proved insufficient or through \r\nattempted agreements and failed commitments.\r\nThe Bolivian people’s ongoing claim is more than a \r\ncentury old, both at the regional level and in multilateral \r\norganizations. Bolivia is certain that whatever the \r\nInternational Court of Justice decides, it will mark a \r\nnew era in the relationship between Bolivia and Chile \r\nso that we can face the future with righteousness and \r\na determination to explore mutually acceptable and \r\nlasting solutions. Our peoples and their leaders must \r\nunite their desire for peace and their political will in a \r\nsingle voice if they are to identify feasible, functional \r\nsolutions that make them feel that they have won rather \r\nthan lost. Practical solutions, forged by creative and \r\neffective diplomacy, have been found to even the oldest \r\nand most complex controversies in the world.\r\nThe Governments and the peoples of Bolivia \r\nand Chile must wait patiently for a legal decision \r\nthat, beyond its formal aspects, can open the door \r\nto a new era of peace, justice and brotherhood. Such \r\nan opportunity deserves the attention of the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, since the decision of the \r\nOrganization’s main legal body to assume jurisdiction \r\nover, hear and adjudicate a dispute, and, in this case, \r\nto suggest parameters for a possible solution, will \r\nset a precedent for fairer societies that are willing to \r\nshare the responsibility for resolving their differences. \r\nThat would be a contrast to the past, when domination \r\nby winning wars was all that counted. That is the \r\nsignificance of our case in the context of the theme of \r\nthe seventy-third session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe have frequently warned the Assembly about the \r\nmany crises facing humankind and life as a whole on our \r\nplanet. Unfortunately, every year we attend this event \r\nto confirm that, despite many praiseworthy efforts, \r\na number of those crises have not only continued but \r\nworsened. I want to take this opportunity to talk about \r\nthe three biggest threats we face. The first is climate \r\nchange. Every year is warmer than the one before. \r\nEvery year more severe weather events occur. Every \r\nyear more people and other living creatures are \r\nirreversibly affected by hurricanes, f loods, droughts \r\nand pollution. While we consider global efforts such as \r\nthe Paris Agreement important, if we do not tackle the \r\nunderlying structural causes of climate change, we will \r\nnot be able to stop it, all the more so when the biggest \r\npolluter in the history of humankind, the United States, \r\nturns its back on science, multilateralism and thereby \r\non humankind. Climate change is an inseparable \r\nconsequence of capitalism, overproduction and patterns \r\nof consumption. The planet is exhausted and so is life \r\nalong with it.\r\nThe second major threat is the arms race, the \r\nculture of war and the possibility of a nuclear disaster. \r\nMany leaders of countries, especially those that have \r\nthe most weapons, come to this forum to talk about \r\npeace. Military spending is growing, with an increase \r\nof 1.1 per cent in 2017 over spending in 2016, and has \r\nnow reached the extraordinary sum of $1.739 trillion, or \r\n2.2 per cent of the global gross domestic product. The \r\nworld cannot live at the expense of those who believe \r\nthat they have the right to produce and use weapons \r\ncapable of totally destroying life on our planet. In \r\naddition, the arms industry feeds off war, and as its \r\nweapons are proved to be effective at killing children, \r\nthe value of their shares increases in the stock market. \r\nThat criminal logic must end. That threat also comes at \r\nthe hand of those who are willing to invade countries \r\nand change Governments in order to expropriate their \r\npeoples’ natural resources. They install military bases \r\nwith the aim of controlling the entire planet.\r\nThe third great threat is inequality. Every year our \r\nwealth is concentrated in fewer hands. In 2017, 82 per \r\ncent of the world’s increase in wealth ended up in the \r\nhands of the richest 1 per cent of the population, while \r\nhalf of humankind saw no increase at all. According \r\nto data from Credit Suisse, 42 people are now worth \r\nthe same as 3.7 billion others taken all together. \r\nThose figures are shameful, and we should all be \r\nashamed, because they represent a model of wealth \r\naccumulation and poverty distribution rather than one \r\nof wealth distribution.\r\nBolivia condemns in the clearest and strongest \r\nterms the illegal, inhuman and criminal economic and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed on Cuba by the United \r\nStates. The United States has the obligation to make \r\nfinancial reparations for the damage done to the heroic \r\nCuban people and should comply with the relevant \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions by immediately lifting \r\nthe blockade. It should also restore Guantanamo to \r\nCuban sovereignty and refrain from any interference or \r\nintervention in its internal affairs.\r\nFrom our seat on the Security Council, we have \r\nclosely followed the progress and difficulties in the \r\nimplementation of the peace agreement signed between \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n34/62 18-29877\r\nthe Government of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas \r\nRevolucionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo. We \r\nare hopeful that the new Government of Colombia will \r\npromote the processes for the social and economic \r\nreintegration of ex-combatants and will protect the \r\nlives of human rights defenders and community leaders, \r\nthereby once again affirming that Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean is a zone of peace.\r\nOur brother country the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela is suffering shameless aggression at the \r\nhands of the United States and its allies. Latin America \r\nfirmly rejects any attempts to intervene militarily in \r\nVenezuela. Venezuelan issues must be solved by the \r\nVenezuelans, and the United States must abandon \r\nthe illegal and unilateral measures that are one of the \r\ncauses of Venezuela’s economic problems.\r\nWe also want to take this opportunity to condemn \r\nthe criminal Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories \r\nand the United States Government’s unilateral and \r\nillegal decision to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel, \r\nwhich jeopardizes any possibility of reaching a just and \r\nlasting peace. We also reiterate our support for a two-\r\nState solution, with a free, independent and sovereign \r\nPalestinian State based on the pre-1967 borders with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nWe deeply regret the fact that the war in Syria \r\nhas caused more than half a million deaths in the \r\npast eight years, a consequence of policies of regime \r\nchange, interference in internal affairs and efforts to \r\nexpropriate natural resources. Bolivia repudiates the \r\nviolations of sovereignty, independence and territorial \r\nintegrity directly or indirectly perpetrated by different \r\nStates, including the United States, and we hope that \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations to reach a political \r\nagreement by and for the Syrians will soon bear fruit. \r\nWe welcome the efforts of Russia, Iran, Turkey and \r\nKazakhstan to prevent any more suffering by the \r\nSyrian people.\r\nIn conclusion, it is my duty to inform the \r\nAssembly about the situation in Bolivia. As is well \r\nknown, we have liberated ourselves from the bonds of \r\nUnited States military bases, the Drug Enforcement \r\nAdministration and the United States Agency for \r\nInternational Development, and from the demands of \r\nthe International Monetary Fund as well as other types \r\nof taxation. Bolivia is now an example to the region and \r\nthe world. We have one of the fastest-growing economies \r\nin the region. In the past decade we have reduced \r\nextreme poverty from 37 per cent to 17 per cent. We \r\nhave increased life expectancy by eight years, lowered \r\ninfant mortality by 56 per cent and reduced chronic \r\nchild malnutrition by 50 per cent. Bolivia invests more \r\nmoney than any other country in the world in renewable \r\nenergies in relation to gross domestic product. We are \r\nbuilding a more just society. We also want to take this \r\nopportunity to inform the Assembly that, as part of an \r\ninitiative to fight corruption, our President and Vice \r\nPresident have renounced bank secrecy. We call on all \r\nHeads of State to pursue such a measure with a view to \r\ngoverning as transparently as possible.\r\nThose achievements have been made possible \r\nthanks to the unity of the Bolivian people, the defence \r\nof our sovereignty, the recovery of our natural resources \r\nand strategic enterprises, the pluralistic economic \r\nmodel and the redistribution of wealth. We reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to multilateralism. It is imperative that we \r\nwork together to build a society with equal opportunities \r\nfor all. We must take care of this planet, our only home. \r\nWe must make this a world where justice is possible and \r\npeace a reality.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Plurinational State of Bolivia for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., \r\nPresident of the Republic of Palau\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Palau.\r\nMr. Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., President of the \r\nRepublic of Palau, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Tommy Esang \r\nRemengesau Jr., President of the Republic of Palau, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Remengesau: Let me begin by congratulating \r\nMs. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on her recent \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-third session, becoming only the fourth \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 35/62\r\nwoman to take that seat and the first to represent her \r\nregion. Palau welcomes her to that prominent role. I \r\nhave no doubt that, as our captain on our voyage towards \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, she will \r\nsteer this canoe in a unique and effective way. Let me \r\nalso express my gratitude to His Excellency Minister \r\nMiroslav Lajčák for his exceptional service during his \r\nrecently completed term.\r\nI would also like to pay my respects to a great leader \r\nand humanitarian, our former Secretary-General and \r\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Kofi Annan. A friend and \r\nally to all, Mr. Annan was the living embodiment of our \r\nmission to create peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties. This year we also celebrate the legacy of \r\nNelson Mandela, which continues to inspire the poor \r\nand the oppressed to demand equal rights. In honour \r\nof the centenary of his birth, the Nelson Mandela \r\nPeace Summit (see A/73/PV.4 and 5) was a historic \r\nopportunity to reaffirm our faith in the principles and \r\nvalues of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Republic of Palau is committed to promoting \r\npeaceful, equitable and sustainable societies both \r\nat home and internationally. We see the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) as the most important \r\nframework for achieving that objective. The path that \r\neach country takes to achieve its goals will be unique, \r\nbut we recognize that all are interlinked and reinforce \r\none another. Palau’s core priorities are health, oceans \r\nand climate change, through which the rest of our \r\ndevelopment objectives, through genuine and durable \r\npartnerships, will be realized.\r\nPalau has declared 2018 as a Year of Good Health. \r\nAt home we are implementing a number of actions to \r\nraise awareness and to cultivate healthier lifestyles so as \r\nto respond to the deadly problem of non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs). Palau is one of the 10 countries with \r\nthe highest rates of obesity in the world. I am sorry to \r\nsay that, while in other parts of the world people are \r\ndying of hunger and poverty, in our corner of the Pacific \r\nwe are dying from overeating and a poor diet. The rise \r\nin the incidence of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and \r\nother NCDs is attributed to unhealthy diets, insufficient \r\nphysical activity, the excessive consumption of salt, \r\nsugar and fat and alcohol and tobacco use. NCDs are \r\nnow the leading cause of death in Palau and, sadly, \r\nthroughout the Pacific region. As many as 75 per cent \r\nof us will die prematurely from NCDs. The crisis has \r\nprompted a strategic shift in focus at Palau’s Ministry \r\nof Health towards increasing preventive services in \r\nan effort to improve the health and livelihoods of our \r\npeople. We are encouraging a return to traditional diets \r\nand increasing our local food production, as much of \r\nthe problem stems from imports of unhealthy junk food. \r\nHowever, in the case of tuberculosis, I am very happy \r\nto report that the incidence of tuberculosis has been \r\nminimal and well under control for the past few years.\r\nFor my country, the ocean is our livelihood, our \r\nculture and our identity, which is why achieving SDG \r\n14 is so critical for us. The ocean is also the foundation \r\nof our booming tourism industry, which will continue \r\nto be the largest provider of jobs in the country. We \r\nhave launched a new campaign, Pristine Paradise \r\nPalau, which makes sustainability a top priority. I \r\nfirmly believe that our environment is our economy \r\nand our economy is our environment. Preserving \r\nour magnificent coral reefs and abundant fisheries \r\nwill ensure that tourism continues to grow, as well \r\nas protecting our food security for generations to \r\ncome. For that reason, we have moved aggressively to \r\nimplement our national marine sanctuary, a no-take \r\nzone that covers 80 per cent of our exclusive economic \r\nzone. It is Palau’s contribution to the global effort to \r\nachieve SDG 14. The marine biodiversity endemic to \r\nPalau is priceless. We are therefore eager to work with \r\nthe scientific community to identify more ways to build \r\nthe resilience of our coral reef ecosystem.\r\nWe are proud of our domestic efforts but international \r\naction remains essential. Last year, the world gathered \r\nhere in this great Hall and declared that the ocean was \r\nsick and needed our united global assistance to restore \r\nit to good health (see resolution 71/312). This year, in \r\nresponse to that call for help, Prime Minister Erna \r\nSolberg of Norway and I, together with representatives \r\nof the Governments of Australia, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, \r\nIndonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, Namibia and \r\nPortugal and the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy \r\nfor the Ocean, launched the High-level Panel for a \r\nSustainable Ocean Economy. The Panel seeks solutions \r\nfor building a transformative political agenda for \r\nocean action and the development of a platform to \r\ndeliver the management and tracking of commitments, \r\ninitiatives and partnerships, including science-based \r\nmonitoring of the ocean, featuring national and \r\nprivate-sector leadership.\r\nPalau is also seeking a strong outcome to the \r\nintergovernmental conference on an international \r\nlegally binding instrument under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n36/62 18-29877\r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity of \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction, which will be an \r\nimportant complement to our domestic actions. Further \r\nout on the horizon, my country will be proud to play \r\nhost to the Our Ocean 2020 Conference. That same \r\nyear, Portugal will host the United Nations Ocean \r\nConference. We must identify our priorities and catalyse \r\nnew coalitions so that the year 2020 will indeed come \r\nto be remembered as a year of action.\r\nMy Government also takes very seriously its \r\ncontribution to the Paris Agreement, which is also \r\nintegral to our plans for achieving SDG 13 and other \r\nrelevant goals. Climate change is the greatest challenge \r\nof our generation. Only this month we once again \r\nsaw the damage that record-breaking cyclones cause \r\nvulnerable countries, as Super Typhoon Mangkhut did \r\nthe Philippines. Building the resilience of vulnerable \r\ncountries to the effects of climate change must be an \r\nurgent global priority.\r\nPalau has developed a climate change policy \r\nframework with the aim of undertaking effective \r\nadaptation measures to deal with the expected effects of \r\nclimate change, strengthen our capacity to prepare and \r\nminimize disaster risks and mitigate climate change by \r\nworking towards low-carbon emission through clean \r\nenergy initiatives. Meanwhile, we continue to work with \r\nour global and regional partners to build capacity and \r\nmainstream climate change into our national planning \r\nand budgeting process. Small island developing States \r\nare indeed making great strides in transforming their \r\nenergy systems. As part of our vision for building \r\na pristine paradise, Palau has adopted ambitious \r\ninternational commitments to increase its supply of \r\nrenewable energy by harnessing the power of the sun \r\nand transforming our energy sector to receive at least \r\n45 per cent of our electricity from renewable sources by \r\n2025. Smokestacks have no place in paradise. Let me \r\nsay that again. Smokestacks have no place in paradise.\r\nOur target represents an extremely ambitious \r\nundertaking but we are confident that, with the right \r\npartners, we can achieve our goal. We take very \r\nseriously our responsibility to reduce our greenhouse \r\ngas emissions as part of the global effort to limit the \r\ntemperature rise to 1.5° Celsius. While Palau emits a \r\nminuscule fraction of the global aggregate, we believe \r\nthat the example we set can inspire many others to act. \r\nEarlier this year, we took a big step forward by enacting \r\na law modernizing our electricity sector to enable it to \r\nmake a rapid transition to renewable energy, and we now \r\nhave the enabling framework to trigger investments in \r\ntransforming our economy so that it can harness the \r\nsun’s power. We can now contemplate the possibility \r\nthat, in the near future, people and consumers will pay \r\nless for electricity and the financial savings will be \r\ndistributed to the areas where it is needed most, such \r\nas health and education. One day very soon, visitors \r\nto our islands will be treated not only to a beautiful \r\nenvironment but also to a bold example of a more \r\nsustainable way of life.\r\nOf course, all of that work depends on the \r\ndedication of our partners and their commitment to \r\nSustainable Development Goal 17. Our ambitious \r\ngoals can only be attained with strong international \r\npartnerships that respect our national priorities and \r\nindependence. Palau is fortunate to have many good \r\nfriends and strong partners. We continue to strengthen \r\nour relationship with the United States of America \r\nthrough the Compact of Free Association, and we offer \r\nour gratitude for our unique relationship. We wish to \r\ngive special thanks to the United States of America \r\nfor the approval of the amended financial provisions \r\nof our Compact. The Government of Japan has also \r\nprovided generous support through the years, and \r\nwe are sincerely grateful. Its friendship, assistance, \r\npartnership and support continue to strengthen our \r\neconomic and social undertakings.\r\nWe would also like to express special thanks to \r\nIndia for its recent efforts to expand and strengthen \r\nits partnership with my country. India has partnered \r\nwith us to improve our youth initiatives and strengthen \r\nfamily projects, and this year I have declared 2018 \r\nas a Year of Good Health, for which India is now a \r\nsignificant partner in reforming our health sector. \r\nWe look forward to working through the Indo-Pacific \r\nstrategy for partnerships in maintaining the integrity of \r\nour maritime areas. Cooperation in surveillance and the \r\nefforts of international law against illegal, unreported \r\nand unregulated fishing will address a major challenge \r\nto sustainable fisheries, as well as improve regional \r\nsecurity. The Government of Australia remains a strong \r\npartner in our maritime surveillance and enforcement \r\nefforts. We also recognize its support to the development \r\nof our information and communications technology \r\nsector through the World Bank.\r\nThe Republic of China, Taiwan has long been an ally \r\nin our efforts to achieve our Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. That special friendship and partnership can \r\nbe seen in our infrastructure investments, as well as \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 37/62\r\ncontinued assistance in health and education. We urge \r\nthe United Nations to seek a solution that will enable \r\nit to include Taiwan in all its processes, including the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization and the World \r\nHealth Organization. My Government firmly believes \r\nthat Taiwan’s inclusion in the United Nations system \r\nwill greatly benefit the work of the United Nations and \r\nits 2030 Agenda and beyond. Palau is fortunate to have \r\ngained many newer partners and friends, and I would \r\nlike to recognize the European Union, Italy, Indonesia, \r\nNew Zealand, Russia, Thailand, Spain, Singapore, \r\nKorea, South Africa, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Viet \r\nNam and many others.\r\nWe remain committed to the need to ensure that \r\nnuclear weapons are never used again. There is an \r\ninextricable connection between testing and the \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. The legacy of the more \r\nthan 2,000 nuclear tests that have been conducted has \r\ntouched people and communities in many regions, \r\nincluding the victims of nuclear testing in the Pacific. \r\nNuclear tests have damaged the environment, human \r\nhealth, food security and economic development. \r\nWeapons of mass destruction have no place in this \r\nworld, and we urge that efforts be made to achieve \r\nthe complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling \r\nof such weapons and ballistic missiles of all ranges by \r\nNorth Korea. The global community must adhere to the \r\nfulfilment and implementation of the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and should uphold the international \r\nrule of law.\r\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General \r\nfor initiating reforms of the United Nations, including \r\nthe repositioning of the United Nations development \r\nsystem. Given the special status of our small island \r\nStates with regard to their vulnerability, remoteness \r\nand size, the reform under way is timely and also \r\nhighlights the need for a strengthened role for United \r\nNations country teams and the resident coordinator \r\nsystem, along with the establishment of permanent \r\noffices for them in our region. We must ensure that the \r\nsmallest countries are able to fully participate in the \r\ndevelopment of reform plans. Palau also reiterates its \r\ncall, as a member of the Pacific small island developing \r\nStates, for the appointment of a Special Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General on climate and security, \r\nwhich would address a significant gap in the United \r\nNations system.\r\nBuilding peaceful, equitable and sustainable \r\nsocieties is no longer an aspirational ideal. It is an \r\nabsolute necessity for addressing the very grave \r\neconomic, environmental and humanitarian challenges \r\nfacing the world. Palau stands with the Assembly as \r\nwe begin the seventy-third session and as we continue \r\nworking on that critical voyage.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Palau for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., President of the \r\nRepublic of Palau, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, President \r\nof the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\r\nMr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Nicolás \r\nMaduro Moros, President of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Maduro Moros (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOn behalf of the Government and the delegation of \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, I would like \r\nto congratulate Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés \r\non her assumption of the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session, the first Latin \r\nAmerican woman to assume that position.\r\nWe have been convened to work on and address at \r\nthis session the important and crucial theme “Making \r\nthe United Nations relevant to all people: global \r\nleadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, \r\nequitable and sustainable societies”. Making the United \r\nNations relevant to all is indeed a noble and lofty \r\nobjective, which the United Nations system must pursue \r\nat the dawn of the twenty-first century, a century of \r\ngreat opportunities that we firmly believe will set the \r\ntone for the processes of human, political and popular \r\nliberation that will have a significant impact on the \r\nfuture of the Organization sooner rather than later.\r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n38/62 18-29877\r\nThe United Nations was born in 1945, in the heat \r\nof the end of the so-called Second World War. The way \r\nit was organized throughout the rest of the twentieth \r\ncentury was a reflection of the post-war conflicts and \r\naction of those years in a bipolar and — after the fall of \r\nthe Soviet Union in the 1990s — a unipolar world. The \r\ncorrelation of forces and the functioning of the world \r\nhave always directly influenced the United Nations \r\nand, in order for it to be relevant, in accordance with \r\nthe objective of the seventy-third session of the General \r\nAssembly, it must express the desires, the way of being, \r\nthe culture, the political thought, the strength and the \r\nhopes of the majority of the peoples of the world.\r\nThat is why Venezuela has come here today — to \r\nspeak its truth. I bring to the Assembly the truth of \r\na fighting, heroic and revolutionary people. I speak \r\non behalf of a homeland that, throughout its history, \r\nhas refused to surrender to injustice or to the empires \r\nthat yesterday were made up of slave owners and \r\ncolonialists and that today are still made up of slave \r\nowners — neocolonialist slave owners. I speak on \r\nbehalf of a historic people who rose up in a heroic \r\nresistance to support indigenous and native peoples \r\nwho for centuries resisted domination by the colonial \r\nempires of the past. I speak on behalf of the country \r\nthat has the honour to be the birthplace of the great \r\nliberator Simón Bolívar, the outstanding leader of the \r\ngeneration of liberators of the Americas, who 200 years \r\nago achieved the heroic feat of founding a continent and \r\na region and of realizing a dream — that of independent \r\nrepublics in this region of the world.\r\nVenezuela is a historic place. It is both a birthplace \r\nand a school of republican values, a birthplace and \r\nschool of rebellion, a birthplace and a school for \r\ndignity and for the values such as equality on which \r\nour homeland has stubbornly insisted in its search \r\nfor its independence and sovereignty throughout the \r\ncenturies. That is the voice I bring to this Hall, which \r\nhas been the backdrop for one of the most infamous and \r\nshameful assaults we have seen in recent years.\r\nOur country has been harassed and assaulted. \r\nYesterday, in this very Hall, the President of the United \r\nStates of America once again attacked the noble people \r\nof Venezuela (see A/73/PV.6), invoking the doctrine that \r\nestablished the United States empire 200 years ago and \r\ndetermined its interventionist role, its purported role \r\nas judge, plaintiff and policeman of the world — the \r\nMonroe Doctrine. In this very Hall, the President of \r\nthe most powerful imperial nation in the world, the \r\nUnited States of America, articulated the doctrine of \r\nJames Monroe, who, in his day, said that America was \r\nfor the people of the United States and that the rest \r\nof the Americas must belong to the United States, as \r\nits backyard, in the interest of the Washington elites \r\nthat dominated the way in which that nation, a former \r\ncolony of the British Empire, was organized. In fact, \r\nhe took the Monroe Doctrine further yesterday. We \r\nmay ask why President Donald Trump unleashed such a \r\nferocious expression of American power at every level \r\nin his speech yesterday.\r\nThis is a historic conflict, as we have often told \r\nthe world. Our people are quite familiar with it. It is \r\na conflict between the imperialist, interventionist, \r\nneocolonialist Monroe Doctrine and the historic \r\nrepublican doctrine of independence, rebellion, dignity, \r\njustice, freedom and equality of our liberator, Simón \r\nBolívar. It is an old conflict. It is an old confrontation \r\nwith an imperialist doctrine seeking to dominate our \r\nregion. In the nineteenth century, it was our region alone \r\nthat they wanted to dominate. In the twentieth century, \r\nthey were already planning to dominate the world. \r\nIn the twenty-first century, they intend to continue \r\ndominating, directing, blackmailing and giving orders \r\nto the world as if it were their own property.\r\nIn our region this is a 200-year-old conflict and \r\nconfrontation between the republican libertarian \r\nf lag — which in the nineteenth century of Simón \r\nBolívar and the liberators advocated a world of balance \r\nand respect — and the pro-imperialist, interventionist \r\nf lags promoting the domination of an entire region \r\nby an elite that had already taken control of power in \r\nWashington. It is an old, historic conflict, with which \r\nwe are very familiar. Today Venezuela is the victim \r\nof ongoing aggression on the economic, political and \r\ndiplomatic fronts — and in the media — by those who \r\ngovern the United States of America. It uses the Monroe \r\nDoctrine to justify from an ideological, political and \r\ndiplomatic point of view the aggression against our \r\nbeloved homeland, our very raison d’être.\r\nWhat is the reason for that political, economic and \r\ndiplomatic aggression against Venezuela? First of all, \r\nit is because Venezuela has carried out an independent \r\nproject of democratic revolution and social redemption \r\nand has built its own new social model, founded on our \r\ncountry’s historical roots, identity and the very culture \r\nof our Latin American region. For 20 years, they have \r\ntried to stop the course of history, development and a \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 39/62\r\nrevolutionary project that was born from the very roots \r\nof the struggles of our people and our region.\r\nSecondly — and this is perhaps more \r\nunderstandable — it is for global geopolitical reasons. \r\nVenezuela has the largest internationally certified \r\noil reserve in the world. Venezuela, a founder of the \r\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, \r\na country that has been producing oil for 100 years, \r\ndiscovered and internationally certified the world’s \r\nlargest oil reserve. Venezuela also possesses significant \r\nnatural and mining resources. Today, our country is \r\npursuing the certification of what could be the world’s \r\nlargest gold reserve, based on international standards. \r\nThe world should know that, in addition to the largest \r\ninternational oil reserve, Venezuela is in the process \r\nof having its gold reserve certified as the largest in the \r\nworld, based on international standards. We are also in \r\nthe process of certifying what will be the fourth-largest \r\ngas reserve in the world. These are significant natural \r\nresources in an important geopolitical, economic and \r\nstrategic location, which has led the oligarchies on our \r\ncontinent and those who dominate from Washington \r\nto consider taking over and controlling Venezuela’s \r\npolitical power.\r\nToday Venezuela is also the victim of ongoing \r\neconomic aggression. In the past two years it has been \r\nsubjected to a series of unilateral, illegal measures of \r\neconomic persecution and blockade. We have been \r\nprevented from using the dollar, the international \r\ncurrency, on the authority of the United States Secretary \r\nof the Treasury. Today Venezuela cannot negotiate \r\nany international transaction using the dollar. Does \r\nthe world know that Venezuela is being persecuted \r\neconomically, commercially and monetarily? Today \r\nwe are subject to a set of illegal, unilateral economic \r\nsanction mechanisms. Yesterday, the President of the \r\nUnited States, from this very rostrum, announced new \r\neconomic and financial so-called sanctions against our \r\ncountry under the cover of law — international law. \r\nDoes the United Nations system know that unilateral \r\nsanctions that use preferential treatment through \r\ncurrency and financial persecution are illegal under \r\ninternational law?\r\nVenezuela is also subject to ongoing aggression \r\nin the media. An attempt has been made to build a \r\nfile to justify an international intervention. Today we \r\nknow that plans have been made for an international \r\nmilitary intervention to control our country. A case \r\nagainst our country has been constructed in the global \r\nmedia, alleging the existence of a humanitarian crisis \r\nand using United Nations concepts to justify permitting \r\na coalition of countries, headed by the Government of \r\nthe United States and its satellite Governments in Latin \r\nAmerica, to get its hands on our country. A migratory \r\ncrisis has been manufactured in various ways, a crisis \r\nthat is collapsing under its own weight and that is \r\nintended to divert attention from the real migratory \r\ncrises that exist in the world and demonstrate the degree \r\nto which the countries of the South are disadvantaged. \r\nThe migratory crisis that exists in Central America, \r\nin Mexico and in Latin America was triggered by the \r\nannouncement of a separation wall against our peoples, \r\na wall dividing our peoples. No one wants to talk \r\nabout that. It is evidence of the double standards in the \r\ntreatment of the real situation of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean migrants, who are contained and persecuted \r\non the border with Mexico, where families have been \r\nseparated and children kidnapped, yet where there is \r\nno interest in addressing or raising awareness about \r\nthe issue.\r\nThere is no interest in drawing attention to \r\nthe seriousness of the migratory crisis caused by \r\nNATO’s destruction of Libya, which has led to the \r\nmigration of thousands, in fact millions, of our African \r\nbrothers — and of the war against Syria, which has \r\nresulted in the migration of people from the Middle \r\nEast. Instead, an attempt has been made to focus on \r\nan alleged migratory crisis in Venezuela through \r\na worldwide media campaign to justify what has \r\nbeen announced for several years — a humanitarian \r\nintervention. It is the same kind of plot that was used \r\nin the story of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. It is \r\nthe same kind of plot that justified intervening in other \r\ncountries but it is now being conducted through a major \r\ncampaign of brutal psychological warfare.\r\nToday Venezuela is also the victim of diplomatic \r\naggression. Yesterday, my brothers and sisters of the \r\nGovernments of the world witnessed as the President \r\nof the United States made direct threats to cut off \r\nand withdraw aid. We witnessed direct threats by \r\nthe Government of the United States to block aid to \r\ninternational support and assistance systems for the \r\nGovernments and peoples of the world who need it. \r\nWe have heard statements from various Governments \r\ndemanding better mechanisms for access to financing \r\nfor development, to which our peoples are entitled. The \r\nPresident of the United States yesterday, from this same \r\nrostrum, threatened the Governments of the world \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n40/62 18-29877\r\nby telling them that they must submit to his designs, \r\nobey his orders and cooperate with his policies in the \r\nUnited Nations system or suffer the consequences. \r\nA ferocious diplomatic offensive has been directed \r\nagainst Venezuela in all the organs of the United \r\nNations system, supported by satellite Governments \r\nthat kneel and sully the honour of the peoples they \r\nclaim to represent.\r\nVenezuela has been subjected to continued political \r\naggression. On 8 September, The New York Times \r\npublished evidence of the participation of White House \r\nand United States Government officials in meetings \r\non how to promote a military coup d’état and bring \r\nabout a change of Government, a regime change, in \r\nVenezuela. The New York Times investigation, which \r\nwas picked up by Time magazine, The Washington \r\nPost and throughout the world press, is further \r\nconfirmation of the conspiracy and the ongoing \r\nattacks by the Government of the United States against \r\nthe strong, constitutional democracy — a people’s \r\ndemocracy — that is the Venezuelan democracy. We \r\nhad already repelled, at the time, attempts to carry out \r\nviolence against our Constitution and to cause riots \r\nand attempted military coups against the constitutional \r\nand revolutionary Government, over which, thanks to \r\nthe popular will and vote, I preside in the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela.\r\nAfter the failure of those apparent attempts to bring \r\nabout riots and military attacks described in the pages \r\nof The New York Times, that newspaper detailed how \r\nUnited States officials, supported by the Colombian \r\nGovernment and institutions, met and offered their \r\nencouragement and support to that attempt at regime \r\nchange. Can the United Nations system, can humankind \r\nand — I say this to my Latin American and Caribbean \r\nbrothers — can Latin America and the Caribbean \r\naccept such methods, which did so much damage to our \r\nregion throughout the twentieth century? How many \r\nmilitary interventions and coups d’état were there? \r\nHow many dictatorships were imposed during the \r\nlong, dark twentieth century in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean? And whom did they favour? The people? \r\nWhose interests did they represent? They represented \r\nthe interests of transnational corporations — interests \r\ncontrary to those of our peoples. We had to endure \r\nlong dictatorships, such as that of Augusto Pinochet \r\nin Chile, because of the determination of the United \r\nStates elites who believed in the Monroe Doctrine to \r\ndeny the right that we had earned to govern ourselves \r\nin the way we need to govern ourselves and to build \r\neconomic, political and cultural systems that were our \r\nregion’s own.\r\nThat is why I said that I have come to bring the \r\ntruth of a people engaged in a struggle. Venezuela is at \r\nthe centre of a political and media campaign that seems \r\nto have no end. That is why we bring the truth of our \r\nhomeland to the General Assembly.\r\nAfter the failure of those illegal, unconstitutional \r\nand criminal attempts to bring about regime change, \r\npublished in The New York Times; after the democratic \r\npresidential election on 20 May, in which this public \r\nservant standing before the Assembly today, Nicolás \r\nMaduro Moros, obtained 68 per cent of the popular \r\nvotes in free elections — the presidential election on \r\n20 May was the twenty-fourth election in 19 years, and \r\nthe Bolivarian revolutionary forces, with varying levels \r\nof approval, have won 22 out of 24 elections against \r\nthe opposition forces in our country; after the failure \r\nof the attempts to carry out military coups d’état; and \r\nafter the failure of the candidacies and electoral tactics \r\nsupported by Washington, with the immense electoral \r\ntriumph that the people gave us, on 4 August, I was \r\nthe victim of a terrorist attack by drones that tried to \r\nassassinate me in military style on a main street of the \r\ncapital city of Caracas. If the attack had been executed \r\nas planned — and this is public knowledge — there \r\nwould have been a massacre and all of Venezuela’s \r\ninstitutional, political and military leaders would have \r\nbeen killed.\r\nThat same 4 August, the terrorist perpetrators of \r\nthe drone attack, the first known global drone attack \r\nby terrorists, were captured by our State’s security \r\nand police agencies. All 28 perpetrators were captured \r\nthrough various investigations, and all of them have \r\nconfessed and been convicted. As has been made \r\npublic and as various Governments around the world \r\nhave been informed, all the investigations indicate that \r\nthe terrorist attack of 4 August was prepared, financed \r\nand planned from the territory of the United States of \r\nAmerica. Through diplomatic channels, I have made \r\nthe United States Government aware of the names of \r\nthe organizers, financiers and planners of the serious \r\nterrorist attack of 4 August, and we have given proof \r\nof their involvement. All the investigations indicate \r\nthat the attack and its perpetrators, as they have \r\nconfessed, were trained and prepared for months on \r\nColombian territory under the protection and support \r\nof the Colombian authorities. The latest investigations \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 41/62\r\nand arrests have revealed, as I have made public, that \r\nsome diplomatic officials of the Governments of Chile, \r\nColombia and Mexico have been implicated by the \r\nperpetrators in efforts to facilitate their escape after the \r\nterrorist attack was carried out.\r\nI want to ask the United Nations system to appoint \r\na special representative of the Secretary-General to \r\nconduct an independent international investigation into \r\nthe implications of the terrorist attack that our country \r\nsuffered on 4 August and those responsible for it. \r\nVenezuela is open — as are the doors of our country \r\nand of our justice system — to establishing direct \r\nresponsibility for that aggression, which is the most \r\nserious to have taken place in our country’s political \r\nhistory. Through their involvement, they sought to \r\ncreate chaos in our homeland and to leave the entire \r\nState leaderless in order to justify national confrontation \r\nand internal violence, thereby rationalizing the \r\nimplementation of mechanisms outside the multilateral \r\nsystem of the United Nations and military intervention, \r\nas other countries have experienced in the past.\r\nVenezuela therefore formally proposes support for \r\nan independent international investigation and that the \r\ntruth about those events be established. Even I have said \r\nto the United States Government how good it would \r\nbe if the United States Government, which has denied \r\nits involvement in preparing and in carrying out those \r\nattacks, were to heed my appeal that the Federal Bureau \r\nof Investigation, together with high-level professionals \r\nand experts, take part in the investigation to clarify and \r\nhelp the Venezuelan justice system to determine the \r\ntruth, and only the truth.\r\nWhen I arrived in New York today, in the afternoon, \r\nI learned that some journalists had asked President \r\nDonald Trump if he was willing to meet Maduro — as \r\nthey call me — Nicolás Maduro, President of Venezuela. \r\nIt seems that President Donald Trump said in some of \r\nhis replies today that if that helped Venezuela, he would \r\nbe willing to do so. I therefore say and affirm to him \r\nfrom this rostrum that, despite the immense historical, \r\nideological and social differences — I am a worker, \r\na bus driver, a man of the people, not a tycoon or a \r\nbillionaire — despite all the differences, which could \r\nbe considered immeasurable, I, Nicolás Maduro Moros, \r\nPresident of Venezuela, would be willing to shake hands \r\nwith the President of the United States and sit down \r\nand discuss our bilateral differences and the issues of \r\nour region that have been so talked about. That is what \r\nI think.\r\nVenezuela is a nation with a tradition of peace. \r\nVenezuela is a friendly country. Venezuelans do not \r\nhate the United States. On the contrary, we appreciate \r\nthe United States, its culture, its arts, its society. But we \r\ndisagree with the imperialist concepts that have taken \r\nhold of political power in Washington since the very \r\nfounding of the nation.\r\nSimón Bolívar was our liberator who wrote, in \r\n1829, almost prophetically: “The United States seems \r\ndestined by Providence to plague America with miseries \r\nin the name of freedom.” He had prophetic vision. It \r\nmust have been hard to see so early what would come \r\nto pass in the twentieth century. Do President Donald \r\nTrump and I have any differences? Indeed we do. \r\nBut it is those with differences who should enter into \r\ndialogue. It is those with differences who must bring \r\ntheir goodwill and their ability to communicate to the \r\ntable. President Trump has said that he is worried about \r\nVenezuela, that he wants to help Venezuela. Well, I am \r\nprepared to discuss, with an open agenda, any topic \r\nwith the American Government with humility, honesty \r\nand sincerity.\r\nAs President of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries, Venezuela f lies the f lag of the dialogue \r\nof civilizations. As President of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, Venezuela will always promote and \r\nparticipate in international political dialogue and \r\nunderstanding as a way to resolve international \r\nconflicts. We advocate political and peaceful means \r\nrather than force. Venezuela has invaluable experience \r\nin organizations such as the Organization of the \r\nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in dealing with \r\ndifferences and building consensus and agreement.\r\nRecently in Algeria, we held a meeting on the Joint \r\nMinisterial Monitoring Committee of OPEC. It was an \r\nextraordinary meeting, attended by the representatives \r\nof the Monitoring Committee, of which our country is \r\none, as well as the representatives of 24 States with the \r\nlargest oil reserves and the biggest producers of oil. \r\nKeeping in mind the cultural, political, geostrategic and \r\ngeopolitical differences, we reached a consensus — one \r\nvoice — in order to continue stabilizing the oil market \r\nat fair, reasonable and stable prices.\r\nWe believe in political dialogue as the way to \r\nchannel solutions, as the way to resolve conflicts. \r\nThere have been attempts to demonize the Bolivarian \r\nrevolution of Venezuela with a brutal campaign never \r\nseen before, first against Commander Hugo Chávez \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n42/62 18-29877\r\nFrías, founder of our revolution and, in the heart of \r\nVenezuelans, eternal Commander, and then against \r\nthis humble man standing here carrying the voice of a \r\npeople, who supports his revolution and democratically \r\nbacks his actions. That is why I reaffirm our will to \r\nparticipate in international dialogue and national \r\npolitical dialogue.\r\nI know that there are Governments represented \r\nin this Hall that are interested in peace, sovereignty, \r\nindependence and justice in Venezuela. I open our \r\narms to all those who wish to help us from Africa, \r\nEurope, Asia and Latin America, while respecting the \r\nsovereignty of the country, without intervening in the \r\ninternal affairs of Venezuela, so that they can support \r\nand assist us in a process of sovereign dialogue for \r\nthe peace, democracy, justice, prosperity and future \r\nof Venezuela — a noble nation that deserves peace, a \r\nfuture and more.\r\nWe bring good tidings from a country that has \r\nnot surrendered and will not surrender. We bring \r\ngood tidings from a nation that is consolidating its \r\ndemocracy. We bring good tidings from a nation that \r\nis empowering its people. We bring good tidings from \r\na country that is building its own social model and its \r\nown social welfare State with new ways of protecting its \r\nelderly, its retirees, its children, its youth, its women, its \r\nmost vulnerable sectors and its workers. We bring good \r\ntidings about our efforts towards economic recovery. \r\nIn mid-August, we launched an economic programme \r\nto bring about growth and prosperity, which is laying \r\nthe foundation for a new economy that does not depend \r\non oil revenue, but is, instead, diversified and can grow \r\nsustainably and build prosperity. We are on our way to \r\na new type of social model.\r\nWe believe in a different world. Our generation \r\nsaw the coming and going of the bipolar world of two \r\nblocs and the Cold War — which some, it seems, wish \r\nto bring back with attacks against China, Russia and \r\nhumble countries like Venezuela. Engaging in combat \r\nagainst countries like Russia and China goes against \r\nwhat should be a humanistic international policy that \r\nrecognizes the emergence of new centres of power and \r\nthe need to build a multipolar world.\r\nVenezuela advocates and is committed to building \r\na multipolar, multicentric world where the various \r\nregions — Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, \r\nEurope, North America — can coexist in balance and in \r\npeace, while respecting each other’s cultures, religions, \r\nidiosyncrasies, identities and various political and \r\neconomic models. There is no single economic model. \r\nWe cannot allow others to impose one particular \r\neconomic model and way of thinking on us. We cannot \r\nallow others to impose a particular cultural or political \r\nmodel on us. Humankind must not all espouse the same \r\nuniform way of thought.\r\nWe demand the cultural, religious and political \r\ndiversity of humankind in this world. That is why \r\nwe advocate the emergence of such a world from the \r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries, the emergence of \r\na world of justice. We assume and reaffirm our solidarity \r\nwith the Arab people of Palestine. There must be justice \r\nin Palestine and respect for its historical territories, as \r\nestablished in 1967 by the United Nations. We raise the \r\nf lag of the Palestinian people.\r\nWe support the call of the United Nations for an end \r\nto the infamous and criminal 50-year blockade against \r\nthe people of Cuba. We have had enough of continuing \r\nto apply obsolete methods of another era against Cuba. \r\nThose same methods are now being applied against \r\nother people, such as the Venezuelan people. We will \r\ntherefore happily vote in the coming days in favour of \r\nthe upcoming draft resolution to reject the blockade and \r\neconomic and financial persecution against Cuba and \r\ndemand that it be lifted immediately.\r\nWe have a world to build. We have a world to \r\nforge. Two hundred years ago, our region was plagued \r\nwith colonies, slavery and injustice. One hundred \r\nyears ago, as a people we strived for freedom. Today, \r\nin the twenty-first century, the time for freedom has \r\ncome — the opportunity has undoubtedly arisen, \r\nfrom the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, from the \r\nrevolutionary ideas of Simón Bolívar and the example \r\nand legacy of Commander Hugo Chávez, whose voice \r\nstill echo in this Hall, clamouring for justice in the \r\nworld, demanding an end to those imperialist practices \r\nof threats, coercion and extortion against our peoples.\r\nToday, we can say that we have lived through 20 \r\nyears of revolution. The past three years have been the \r\nmost difficult with harassment, aggression and attacks. \r\nWe have endured political, media, diplomatic, economic \r\nand financial attacks and persecution, and I can say \r\ntoday, on 26 September, that Venezuela is stronger \r\nthan ever. We have managed to resist and have found \r\nstrength in our own historical core to still be standing \r\ntoday, victorious and ready to continue building our \r\nown social model — that of the socialist revolution \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 43/62\r\nof the twenty-first century. We proclaim it to the four \r\nwinds. It is a new revolution of independence, dignity \r\nand justice. Today we are stronger than ever.\r\nTwo days ago we witnessed the tribute to Nelson \r\nMandela (see A/73/PV.5). To speak of Mandela is to \r\nspeak of rebellion. Mandela has been portrayed as a \r\nfool, as someone who did not fight. Mandela is rebellion \r\nin the face of injustice. He is courage and bravery. He \r\nis a challenge to the oppressors. We consider ourselves \r\nto be following the legacy of Nelson Mandela and of \r\nthe great African leaders who have raised the banner of \r\nequality and justice in the face of slavery, racism and \r\ncolonialism in all of its forms.\r\nWe heard the tribute to Nelson Mandela and \r\nreflected on how much the world has changed. Only \r\n30 years ago, Mandela was considered a terrorist by \r\nthe United States Congress of the North American \r\nGovernment. Just a few years ago, Mandela was still \r\non the terror watch list. Does that not sound familiar? \r\nNelson Mandela was a terrorist, he was sanctioned and \r\npersecuted, abandoned. How the world has changed. \r\nToday, Nelson Mandela is a f lag that we embrace with \r\nlove and conviction. He is a symbol of what is possible \r\nif rebellion, struggle and justice can win the noble \r\nhearts and minds of people.\r\nI have confidence in the future of humankind. I \r\nhave confidence in the destiny of my country. I have \r\nconfidence in the common future of this community, \r\nthe United Nations. After having survived coup d’état \r\nattempts and terrorist attacks, I can still say that I \r\nhave confidence in human beings and in the future \r\nof humankind. From Venezuela, we say to the United \r\nNations that we have confidence in the noble ideals \r\nof a people that, like the people of Venezuela, has not \r\nsurrendered and will not surrender. The Assembly can \r\ncount on Venezuela for the great causes of the future of \r\nthe United Nations and the future of a multipolar world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Faustin Archange Touadera, \r\nPresident of the Central African Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Central African Republic.\r\nMr. Faustin Archange Touadera, President of the \r\nCentral African Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Faustin \r\nArchange Touadera, President of the Central African \r\nRepublic, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Touadera (spoke in French): First of \r\nall, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to \r\nthe Republic of Ecuador, and especially to Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa Garcés, on her well-deserved \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-third session. I can assure her of my country’s \r\nfull support for the fulfilment of her mandate. I would \r\nalso like to commend Mr. Miroslav Lajčák for his work \r\nand the remarkable results achieved during the seventy-\r\nsecond session, which have contributed significantly to \r\nstrengthening cooperation among our States.\r\nI would also like to express my gratitude and \r\nreiterate our confidence in Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres for his ongoing commitment to peace and \r\ndevelopment in the world, and especially for the \r\nconstant and multifaceted support for my country, the \r\nCentral African Republic. I would also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to pay a heartfelt tribute to the great \r\nAfrican and world leader, Kofi Annan, who passed away \r\non 18 August. I salute his memory and acknowledge his \r\ntireless efforts at the helm of the United Nations with a \r\nview to building a better world.\r\nThis seventy-third session is exploring an important \r\ntheme. I therefore come to share our contribution \r\nin order to ensure that the United Nations remains \r\nrelevant for all in the context of a global partnership \r\nand shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable \r\nand sustainable societies. In the twenty-first century, \r\nthat goal requires structural reforms within our \r\nOrganization, which for more than 70 years has made \r\nconsiderable gains that must be consolidated even if \r\nchallenges and weaknesses still remain.\r\nThe aim of the current session is to promote \r\nreflection on how our common Organization should \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n44/62 18-29877\r\naddress the new challenges facing the world and our \r\nsocieties today, such as terrorism, violent extremism, \r\nclimate change, migration and poverty. The role of \r\nthe United Nations through the combined efforts of \r\nMember States in multilateral action has led to major \r\nadvances in global peace, security and development.\r\nThat was true yesterday for the emancipation of \r\npeople through self-determination. It is still true today \r\nin the search for solutions to increasingly complex \r\nproblems — violent extremism and international \r\nterrorism, the eradication of poverty, the persistence of \r\nconflicts in the world, lingering economic and social \r\ninequalities, the widening development gap among \r\nStates and the massive violation of human rights. That \r\nis why my country, the Central African Republic, \r\nwill continue to support the central role of the United \r\nNations in preserving and maintaining peace and \r\nsecurity in the world.\r\nThe global leadership embodied by the United \r\nNations must be strengthened and equipped with \r\nthe necessary tools to respond effectively to current \r\nchallenges, while ensuring a better division of labour \r\namong Member States. My country supports the \r\nposition of the African Union, which seeks Africa’s full \r\nrepresentation in all United Nations bodies, especially \r\nthe Security Council, which is the main decision-making \r\nbody of our common Organization in matters related to \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIt is high time to correct the historical inequality \r\nthat continues to deprive Africa of a permanent seat \r\non the Security Council with veto power. In the same \r\nvein, my country joins the African voice in supporting \r\nan increase in the number of members elected by the \r\nGeneral Assembly to the Security Council. That will \r\nallow for a fairer and more balanced participation in \r\nthat organ, which will ensure a more representative role \r\nin the promotion of international peace.\r\nThe rise of terrorism and violent extremism is a \r\nserious threat to international security. It seriously \r\nundermines social cohesion in our countries, exposes \r\nour populations to indiscriminate violence, generates \r\na succession of humanitarian crises and thwarts \r\ndevelopment efforts.\r\nGiven that grim reality, Africa is showing its \r\nwillingness to overcome regional divisions, pool \r\nresources and lay the foundations for a holistic and \r\ncoherent approach that contributes to the development \r\nof a global doctrine against those prevailing asymmetric \r\nthreats. That is the best strategy for preventing and \r\ncombating those scourges through specific responses \r\nadapted to our environment within the framework of \r\nthe global peace and security architecture.\r\nAnother concern today is the problematic extent \r\nof the migration phenomenon. When well managed, \r\nmigration can have a substantial positive impact on \r\nthe development of countries of origin and significant \r\nbenefits for destination countries. When poorly \r\nmanaged, migration can have serious consequences \r\nfor the well-being of countries and migrants, with a \r\nhigh probability of destabilizing national and regional \r\nsecurity. That is why my country welcomes the holding \r\nin December of an intergovernmental conference on the \r\nglobal compact for safe, orderly and regular migration \r\nin Marrakech, Morocco, and hopes that the forum will \r\nlead to constructive proposals.\r\nOn an equally important note, our planet continues \r\nto suffer the effects of natural phenomena such as \r\nearthquakes, rainfall, drought, the rapid advance of the \r\ndesert and global warming. I would therefore like to \r\ntake this opportunity to encourage all States that are \r\nsignatories to the Paris Agreement under the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change to \r\njoin efforts to preserve our shared environment and to \r\nensure sustainable development for our planet.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to discuss \r\nthe situation in my country, the Central African \r\nRepublic. But first, I want to honour the memory of all \r\nthose who have fallen in the exercise of their perilous and \r\nnoble peace mission in the Central African Republic. I \r\nwould like to convey the tremendous gratitude of the \r\npeople of the Central African Republic to the entire \r\ninternational community for all its sacrifices to bring \r\npeace to my country.\r\nFor two and a half years, my Government has been \r\nworking tirelessly to restore the fundamental values \r\nthat underpin democracy, freedom and human rights. To \r\nthat end, we are working to re-establish State authority \r\nby continuing to gradually deploy State administration \r\nand services in our provinces and to restore basic \r\nsocial services.\r\nOn the other hand, we deplore the continuing tragic \r\nand painful attacks perpetrated by the enemies of peace, \r\nwho are driven by dark and selfish interests. They have \r\nbeen fuelling the bloody violence since the beginning \r\nof the year, both in the capital and in the interior of the \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 45/62\r\ncountry, with an increase in violations of human rights \r\nand international humanitarian law.\r\nNotwithstanding all those challenges, the \r\nGovernment has maintained the momentum of reforms \r\nin the security and defence sectors, where significant \r\nprogress has been made, namely, the gradual \r\ndeployment of the Central African internal defence \r\nand security forces and the implementation of the \r\nnational disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and \r\nreintegration programme.\r\nIn that regard, I welcome the commitment made \r\nby the European Union and our bilateral partners to \r\nsupporting the training and bolstering of our defence \r\nand security forces, on the one hand, and to supporting \r\nthe implementation of the national defence plan and the \r\ndeployment of the Central African Armed Forces, with \r\na view to setting up a garrison army and establishing \r\ncontrol throughout the national territory, on the \r\nother hand.\r\nWe are also eternally grateful to the United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in \r\nthe Central African Republic (MINUSCA), the United \r\nStates of America, the People’s Republic of China, the \r\nRussian Federation and France for the material support \r\nprovided to the Central African Armed Forces. Our \r\nambition is to see them become truly operational and to \r\ncontribute, alongside MINUSCA, to the immense effort \r\nto stabilize and restore lasting peace to the Central \r\nAfrican Republic. But, in order to do so, allow me to \r\nreiterate from this rostrum our call for the total lifting of \r\nthe arms embargo still weighing on our national army.\r\nThe reconstruction programme for the Central \r\nAfrican Republic requires a coherent framework as \r\nembodied in the National Recovery and Peacebuilding \r\nPlan, which is being implemented and has already seen \r\nthe Government and its international partners launch 21 \r\nprojects regarding basic social services. That tangible \r\nprogress is the fruit of the multifaceted, invaluable and \r\ncommendable support of our strategic partners, such as \r\nthe World Bank, the African Development Bank, the \r\nEuropean Union and the French Development Agency.\r\nWe have also dedicated ourselves to the fight \r\nagainst impunity through substantial support for the \r\nrehabilitation of the national judicial system, which, \r\namong other things, has enabled our criminal court \r\nto hold two sessions this year to try common law \r\ncases. Moreover, the Special Criminal Court will soon \r\nbegin its first investigations, while the Government \r\nhas established the framework for the Truth, Justice, \r\nReparations and Reconciliation Commission.\r\nIn that context, one year since its operationalization \r\nin September 2017, the panel of facilitators of the \r\nAfrican Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in the \r\nCentral African Republic has concluded two rounds of \r\nconsultations and a meeting with armed groups to hear \r\ntheir demands for an inclusive dialogue. I am pleased \r\nto recall that the African Initiative is the one and only \r\nreference framework for all those willing to support the \r\nCentral African people on the path to dialogue. In that \r\nregard, I continue to urge all the friends of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic to generously assist us through robust \r\nsupport for the efforts of the panel of facilitators of \r\nthe African Initiative, whose accomplishments to date \r\nmust be consolidated. My greatest wish is to enable my \r\ncompatriots to resolve their differences once and for all \r\nin good faith and to strengthen the ancestral ties that \r\nbind them.\r\nToday, the Government and the people of the \r\nCentral African Republic are firmly committed to \r\nstrengthening the democratic process and the economic \r\nrecovery in the country. Given the many challenges that \r\nbeset our history, we will be patient but determined in \r\nour actions, vigilant and aware of the magnitude of the \r\ntask that lies ahead.\r\nFor my part, I can affirm my determination to spare \r\nno effort to create the necessary conditions for the \r\nreconciliation and the reconstruction of my country in \r\norder to give back to the Central Africans, my people, \r\nthe joy and the desire to live together. I extend our \r\neternal gratitude to all our partners and to the entire \r\ninternational community for their ongoing concern for \r\nour well-being.\r\nIn conclusion, I hope that the international \r\ncommunity will remain mobilized alongside the \r\nCentral African people and work together with the \r\nGovernment for the recovery of my country. I wish our \r\nwork every success.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Central African Republic for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Faustin Archange Touadera, President of the \r\nCentral African Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n46/62 18-29877\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak \r\nAl-Hamad Al Sabah, Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Kuwait\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Kuwait.\r\nSheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al Sabah, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Kuwait, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Highness Sheikh \r\nJaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al Sabah, Prime Minister \r\nof the State of Kuwait, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nSheikh Al Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, it is my pleasure, on behalf of the Government \r\nand people of the State of Kuwait, to extend my \r\nsincere congratulations to the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-third session on her election, as \r\nwell as to her friendly country, Ecuador. I would also \r\nlike to reassure her of our full support in facilitating her \r\nwork and fulfilling her responsibilities. We are fully \r\nconfident of her ability to undertake that task, as her \r\nexperience in international affairs will have a positive \r\nimpact on conducting this session’s work.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to express \r\nmy country’s sincere appreciation for the outstanding \r\nefforts of her predecessor during his able and successful \r\npresidency throughout the previous session.\r\nAllow me also to commend the great efforts of \r\nthe Secretary-General in leading the Organization \r\nwith visions and ideas for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security based on the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter. We firmly support his \r\nreform initiatives, particularly those relating to ways \r\nto settle conflicts peacefully, which promote practical \r\nrather than theoretical preventive diplomacy. That \r\nwould be achieved through a United Nations plan that \r\nensures consensus on effective reforms in order for the \r\ninternational organization to play its desired role.\r\nPreventing and resolving conflicts by peaceful \r\nmeans continue to be one of the most important reasons \r\nfor the establishment of the United Nations. After the \r\nbloody experiences of the First and Second World \r\nWars, despite their unprecedented and catastrophic \r\nconsequences for humankind, those wars constituted \r\nthe genuine motivation for developing a meaningful \r\ninternational system to protect our present and future \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war.\r\nThe United Nations has played a critical and \r\nhistorical role in the past seven decades, during which \r\nit has developed its working methods and expanded its \r\nmandates to include humanitarian, political, security, \r\ndevelopment and economic issues throughout the world. \r\nHowever, growing challenges, increasingly severe \r\nconflicts and the risks that they pose for international \r\npeace and security have shown the urgent need to \r\nenhance the ability of the United Nations to adequately \r\nrespond to the challenges facing our world today. Those \r\nchallenges include the spread of violence, extremism \r\nand terrorism, as well as the dangers pertaining to \r\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the \r\ncontinuous violations of human rights, climate change \r\nand others.\r\nThe proposals and plans that the Secretary-General \r\nhas introduced to restructure the Secretariat, with a \r\nview to enhancing its effectiveness and increasing its \r\nefficiency in order to ensure that its efforts in ending \r\nconflicts are not wasted, are a preliminary important \r\nstep to transform the issue of reform from hypothetical \r\ndiscussion to realistic application. In that regard, we \r\nstress once again our support for that step, which is part \r\nof the expectations that the peoples of the world have \r\nof the Organization, considered to be a safe haven and \r\nguarantor of global peace and stability.\r\nNine months into our non-permanent membership \r\nof the Security Council for the period 2018-2019, the \r\nState of Kuwait has become increasingly aware of the \r\nneed to reform the Security Council to make it more \r\ncapable of shouldering its responsibilities and facing \r\nthe growing challenges of today’s world. The reform \r\nmust reflect the international reality in which we live \r\nand strengthen the credibility and legitimacy of the \r\nSecurity Council, while ensuring permanent Arab \r\nrepresentation commensurate with the number of Arab \r\nMember States and the size of their contribution to the \r\nvarious activities of the United Nations.\r\nSince its first day as a non-permanent member of \r\nthe Security Council, the State of Kuwait has adopted \r\nan objective approach in addressing various issues on \r\nthe Council’s agenda. Such an approach is a realistic \r\nreflection of its foreign policy, which is based on \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 47/62\r\nrespect for the sovereignty and independence of States \r\nand non-interference in their internal affairs. We also \r\nbelieve in the noble objective of the United Nations, \r\nwhich is that of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. Our involvement in the Security Council’s \r\nagenda was not constrained by any cultural, ethnic, \r\npolitical or geographical consideration, although its \r\nagenda is replete with Middle Eastern issues.\r\nThrough our non-permanent membership of the \r\nSecurity Council, the State of Kuwait seeks to go \r\nbeyond routine participation in the work of the Council. \r\nWe aim to broaden our horizons in order to elevate the \r\nsovereignty of international law, with all its branches, \r\nincluding respect for human rights, building a better \r\nfuture for the world’s population and avoiding any \r\nselectivity or partiality in addressing the various issues. \r\nThat trend is based on the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand on the diplomatic legacy of the State of Kuwait. \r\nIt gives preference to achieving peaceful solutions and \r\npromoting mediation efforts between parties. It ref lects \r\nhow we address the various issues and crises ravaging \r\nour world today. Human beings and their inherent \r\nrights remain the pillars of our foreign policy, based on \r\nthe directives of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad \r\nAl-Jaber Al-Sabah — may God protect him — the \r\nEmir of the State of Kuwait, who was honoured by the \r\nOrganization as a leader of humanitarian work.\r\nThe Palestinian question is one of the most \r\nimportant and long-standing issues on the agenda of \r\nthe Security Council. This year marks the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption in August 1948 of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 56 (1948). It was the first time the \r\nCouncil addressed that protracted issue. Successive \r\nresolutions were adopted by the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly, as well as multiple international \r\nand regional initiatives, to lay the foundations for \r\npeace in the Middle East. However, Israel persists in \r\nits intransigence and continues to reject and ignore \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy. It continues \r\nits expansionist policies through the establishment of \r\nillegal settlements on occupied Palestinian territories. \r\nSuch action constitutes a significant challenge to and \r\nblatant disregard for implementing resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy, the most recent of which is \r\nresolution 2334 (2016), which calls on Israel to stop its \r\nillegal settlement practices.\r\nFurthermore, Israel continues to desecrate the \r\nsanctity of the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, in \r\naddition to its continued violations of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law, by detaining thousands \r\nof Palestinians in its prisons and detention centres and \r\nthrough its repeated military aggressions on the Gaza \r\nStrip, during which it does not take into account the \r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict. It disregards \r\nthe agreed international measures under the Geneva \r\nConvention relative to the Protection of Civilian \r\nPersons in Time of War.\r\nGiven that the State of Kuwait seeks the full \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions, we \r\nsubmitted a draft resolution at the Security Council in \r\nMay, which repeatedly called on Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, to immediately cease the use of illegitimate \r\nforce against civilians. That draft resolution also \r\ncalled for international protection to ensure the safety \r\nand security of Palestinian civilians in the occupied \r\nterritories. Although the draft resolution was not \r\nadopted, the State of Kuwait will spare no effort to \r\nsupport the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople until the occupation ends and permanent, just \r\nand comprehensive peace is achieved, in accordance \r\nwith the principle of land for peace and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, while implementing all relevant resolutions \r\nof international legitimacy, which call for the two-State \r\nsolution and the establishment of a Palestinian State, \r\nbased on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital.\r\nThe Syrian crisis has entered its eighth year. The \r\ninternational community remains to a large extent \r\nunable to find a solution that ends its devastating \r\nconsequences and horrific losses. Syrian citizens have \r\nremained the main victims of a conflict that has claimed \r\nthe lives of more than 400,000 people, in addition to \r\nmore than 12 million people who have become refugees \r\nand displaced persons.\r\nThe State of Kuwait, in cooperation and \r\ncoordination with the delegation of the friendly \r\nKingdom of Sweden, put forward resolution 2401 \r\n(2018) on the humanitarian situation in Syria, which \r\nwas unanimously adopted by the Security Council. It \r\nwas a positive sign of the solidarity and unity of the \r\nCouncil to end that human suffering, stop the hostilities \r\nand guarantee humanitarian access to those in need in \r\nSyria in a timely manner. Yet, today we deplore the fact \r\nthat resolution 2401 (2018) has not been implemented \r\non the ground.\r\nSuch efforts take place in the context of the \r\nhumanitarian role played by the State of Kuwait to \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n48/62 18-29877\r\naddress the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in \r\nSyria since the beginning of the crisis. In the course \r\nof such efforts, we have hosted three international \r\ndonor conferences to galvanize support to ease the \r\nhumanitarian situation in Syria. My country has \r\nmade voluntary contributions totalling $1.6 billion at \r\nthose conferences.\r\nIn that regard, we reiterate our principled and \r\nunwavering position with regard to the Syrian crisis. \r\nWe reject any military solution to the crisis and stress \r\nthe need to step up efforts to bring all parties to the \r\nconflict together and start a dialogue in order to reach \r\na peaceful settlement, in line with the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, in particular resolution 2254 \r\n(2015). The goal is to achieve a political reality agreed \r\nupon by all components of the Syrian people. That \r\nshould preserve the unity and independence of Syria in \r\norder to attain the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian \r\npeople and ensure that the perpetrators of crimes are \r\nbrought to justice and enjoy no impunity.\r\nOur brothers in Yemen are facing critical \r\nunprecedented challenges, with serious implications \r\nat the political, humanitarian and economic levels as a \r\nresult of the coup d’état against the legitimate authorities \r\nby the Houthis in September 2014. The Houthis continue \r\nto reject the implementation of the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, as well as international initiatives \r\nto achieve a political settlement. They remain a threat \r\nto the security and stability of the region by launching \r\nballistic missiles against the sisterly Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia. Such action threatens the safety of \r\nnavigation at Bab al-Mandab strait and the Red Sea. We \r\nstrongly condemn such actions, which are contrary to \r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law.\r\nIn that regard, we underscore once again our \r\nfull commitment to respecting Yemen’s sovereignty, \r\nindependence and territorial integrity, while rejecting \r\ninterference in Yemeni internal affairs. We stress our \r\nfull support for the constitutional legitimacy of Yemen, \r\nas the cradle of Arab civilization. We also stress the \r\nimportance of prioritizing the political solution to \r\nthe crisis by resorting to the three agreed terms of \r\nreference: the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative and \r\nits Implementation Mechanism, the outcomes of the \r\nComprehensive National Dialogue and the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, in particular resolution \r\n2216 (2015).\r\nGiven Kuwait’s preventive diplomacy, which is \r\nbased on mediation and political settlement, for over \r\n100 days in 2016 my country hosted the political \r\nconsultations between the Yemeni parties, under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations. We underscore our \r\nreadiness to host our Yemeni brethren for the signing \r\nof a final agreement whenever it is reached by Yemeni \r\nparties. We stress our ongoing support for the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations and those of the Special Envoy of \r\nthe Secretary-General for Yemen to achieve a peaceful \r\nsolution to the crisis without delay.\r\nThe coup d’état against Yemen’s legitimacy has \r\nconsequences that play a major role in the deterioration \r\nof the humanitarian situation in the country. Such \r\nconsequences have led to frightening and unprecedented \r\nstatistics. In fact, the Yemeni people continue to suffer, \r\nas they struggle to survive daily. The State of Kuwait \r\nhas not ignored the needs of its brothers in Yemen. We \r\nhave contributed a total of $350 million. We pledged \r\n$250 million of that amount at the Geneva conference \r\nin April, where it was handed over in full to the United \r\nNations agencies and its humanitarian bodies. The \r\npurpose of that contribution was to mitigate the serious \r\ndeterioration at the humanitarian, health and economic \r\nlevels. However, that deterioration will not stop until \r\nsecurity and stability in Yemen are restored, which will \r\nin turn help to maintain its sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity and re-establish harmony among all groups in \r\nthe country.\r\nThe growing phenomenon of terrorism and violent \r\nextremism in the world, particularly in the Middle East, \r\nis an unprecedented challenge that has stricken the world \r\norder at its core. It has happened through the ideologies \r\nof secretive and rogue organizations, under the cloak of \r\nIslam, to achieve their destructive intentions.\r\nThe so-called Da’esh terrorist organization has \r\nperpetrated savage crimes, including widespread \r\nmurder and destruction in various areas of the region. \r\nIn response, the Global Coalition against Da’esh was \r\nestablished, a development for which the State of Kuwait \r\nhas provided material and moral support, in line with \r\nthe conventions on combating terrorism adopted by \r\nthe League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation and the United Nations from 1999 to \r\n2001. Our brothers in Iraq were the first to suffer from \r\nthe crimes of that terrorist organization. Cooperation \r\nbetween the international community, represented by \r\nthe Security Council and the Government of Iraq, has \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 49/62\r\nplayed a highly effective role in clearing Iraqi territories \r\nof that terrorist and dangerous cancer.\r\nProceeding from our conviction that post-war peace \r\nand security cannot be achieved without redressing \r\nthe impact of conflicts and their devastating effects, \r\nwhich undermine humankind, my country hosted the \r\nInternational Conference for the Reconstruction of \r\nIraq. At that conference, pledges exceeded $30 billion, \r\nof which the State of Kuwait contributed $2 billion. In \r\nthat regard, we underscore our firm position in favour \r\nof providing all forms of support in order to assist Iraq \r\nin fulfilling its outstanding commitments under the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions and restoring its \r\nrole and position in the region and the world.\r\nAt the regional level, and based on the same \r\nprinciples of good-neighbourliness and non-interference \r\nin the internal affairs of States, as set out in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and international law, we once \r\nagain call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to adopt \r\nserious confidence-building measures to establish \r\nrelations based on cooperation, mutual respect and \r\ncommon interests. That would serve to direct efforts \r\nand capabilities towards promoting development and \r\nconstruction, and would reflect the hopes of all peoples \r\nin the region for a life of security and stability.\r\nWhile confirming what I said earlier about the role \r\nthat my country has been playing, which is based on \r\nprioritizing humanitarian issues, and in response to \r\nthe tragic situation facing the refugees of the Rohingya \r\nMuslim minority in Myanmar, the State of Kuwait helped \r\nto organize the Security Council visit to Bangladesh \r\nand Myanmar. The aim of that visit was to discuss the \r\nrefugee crisis, become familiar with the situation and \r\nassess the steps taken by the authorities of the two \r\ncountries towards one of the worst humanitarian crises \r\nin the world. We will pursue our efforts, as a member of \r\nthe Security Council, to cooperate and coordinate with \r\nall parties concerned in order to guarantee the safe, \r\nvoluntary and dignified return of the refugees and hold \r\naccountable all those responsible for crimes committed \r\nagainst them.\r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment is one of the most successful achievements \r\nof the United Nations. It complements the efforts of the \r\ninternational community based on the fundamental \r\nrules emanating from the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, which achieved their noble objectives and spurred \r\nthe United Nations to shift from defining relative goals \r\nfor confronting challenges to a comprehensive phase of \r\nradical and people-centred solutions.\r\nMeeting our international obligations and \r\nachieving global solidarity represent a major leap \r\ntowards attaining the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nin order to eradicate poverty in all its forms; ensure \r\nthat all human beings enjoy equal rights to dignity, \r\neducation, health and political participation; empower \r\nyoung people and women; and address the effects of \r\nclimate change in the context of the historic Paris \r\nAgreement. Environmental degradation is one of the \r\nmain obstacles to attaining those Goals, in accordance \r\nwith the principle of shared responsibility, taking into \r\naccount the different responsibilities and burdens.\r\nThe issue of migrants and refugees is perhaps one \r\nof the most prominent challenges facing sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We therefore look forward to the 2018 \r\ninternational conference on migration, to be held in \r\nthe city of Marrakech in December, at which the global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration will \r\nbe adopted.\r\nAs the State of Kuwait seeks to improve the \r\nwelfare of people, we have taken effective measures \r\nto implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment as a priority of all our national plans \r\nand programmes, with the participation of all sectors \r\nof society. That was embodied in the future national \r\nvision for a new Kuwait to be accomplished by 2035, \r\nseeking to transform Kuwait into a leading regional, \r\nfinancial, commercial, cultural and institutional centre.\r\nThe State of Kuwait has always shouldered its \r\nregional and international responsibilities to achieve \r\ndevelopment in its various economic, social and \r\nenvironmental dimensions. We have made major \r\nstrides in implementing the initiatives of His Highness \r\nthe Emir of the State of Kuwait to promote international \r\npartnerships. Such partnerships complement the \r\nongoing history of Kuwait in the development and \r\nhumanitarian fields. In fact, Kuwait spared no effort \r\nin offering development assistance to developing \r\ncountries, as well as to least developed countries, \r\ntotalling 106 countries to date. We play our role as \r\nan active Member of the United Nations through our \r\nvarious institutions, in particular the Kuwait Fund for \r\nArab Economic Development. We provide grants and \r\nsoft loans for infrastructure projects in developing \r\ncountries. Such assistance is more than double the \r\ninternationally agreed upon percentage.\r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n50/62 18-29877\r\nI would like to underscore that the State of Kuwait \r\nis committed to the international multilateral system \r\nand to the purposes and principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter. We believe in the importance and necessity \r\nof advancing all efforts to guarantee the continuity \r\nand contribution of our long-standing Organization \r\nby having all States fulfil their commitments and \r\nresponsibilities under international conventions and \r\nconferences. That will contribute to finding fair \r\nand just solutions to global threats and challenges \r\nand to accomplishing the lofty goal of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Kuwait for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad \r\nAl Sabah, Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Xavier Bettel, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister of State, Minister for Communication \r\nand Media, and Minister for Worship of the \r\nGrand Duchy of Luxembourg\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPrime Minister, Minister of State, Minister for \r\nCommunications and Media, and Minister for Worship \r\nof the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\r\nMr. Xavier Bettel, Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nState, Minister for Communications and Media \r\nand Minister for Worship of the Grand Duchy of \r\nLuxembourg, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Xavier \r\nBettel, Prime Minister, Minister of State, Minister for \r\nCommunications and Media and Minister for Worship \r\nof the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Bettel (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): \r\nYesterday, our Secretary-General provided his view \r\nof the international situation and the challenges that \r\nwe all face (see A/73/PV.6). His view was a mixed \r\none, to say the least. We are experiencing a decline in \r\nmultilateralism on all fronts and a challenge to the basis \r\nof the international system based on respect for the rule \r\nof law.\r\nHowever, multilateralism and respect for the rule of \r\nlaw ensure that democracies can play an international \r\nrole. They are even a prerequisite for the exercise of \r\ntheir sovereignty. Nowhere is the need for and evidence \r\nof the merits of multilateralism more present than in \r\ncommon projects to establish and maintain peace. The \r\nEuropean Union is an excellent example in that regard. \r\nI am part of the generation born in Europe that has \r\nnever experienced war. It appears that we take that for \r\ngranted. However, we must not forget that there are \r\nconflicts just beyond our borders.\r\nThe same holds true in the area of international \r\ntrade. In that regard, the increasing number of \r\nmultilateral measures and counter-measures will \r\neventually undermine our growth. We are strongly \r\nin favour of resuming negotiations and constructive \r\nengagement through the World Trade Organization. \r\nIf that does not occur, all parties are at the risk of \r\nlosing out. That would entail being open to discussions \r\non sensitive and difficult subjects.\r\nSome challenges can be solved only at the global \r\nlevel. Migration is the best example of that kind of \r\nchallenge. Demographic trends suggest that it is likely \r\nthat the issue will be on the agenda for a few generations. \r\nWe hope that the global compact for safe, orderly \r\nand regular migration to be adopted in Marrakech \r\nin December this year will provide a framework for \r\nunderstanding the global phenomenon in countries of \r\norigin, transit and destination. It should also lead to \r\nbetter management of migration f lows at the regional \r\nlevel. In the European Union, we know that it should \r\nallow for the establishment of common policies and \r\nsolidarity mechanisms among Member States with \r\nregard to accepting refugees. It is regrettable that some \r\ncountries have forgotten that their citizens were once \r\nrefugees from somewhere in the world.\r\nMy country has made considerable efforts since \r\n2015 to receive asylum seekers, including through \r\nresettlement and relocation mechanisms. The global \r\ncompact’s comprehensive framework for migration \r\nhas made it possible to determine what is expected of \r\ncountries of origin and destination, but also — and this \r\nis very important — what is expected of migrants with \r\nregard to their integration.\r\nThe issue of integration has often been linked to the \r\nrise of populism in Europe. Let me inform the Assembly \r\nthat countries of various sizes within the European \r\nUnion, including large ones, had populist Governments \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 51/62\r\nbefore the 2015 migration crisis. Moreover, those same \r\ncountries now challenge the founding principles of the \r\nEuropean Union pertaining to respect for the rule of \r\nlaw. I would like to note today — and condemn — the \r\nfact that some political parties have become successful \r\nby exploiting the weakest.\r\nOf course, a clear distinction must be made between \r\npolitical refugees and economic migrants. Those who \r\nwant to survive — those who flee rape, violence, \r\npersecution, imprisonment and death —must be able to \r\nfind safe haven on our continent.\r\nWe have heard warnings from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and from the scientific community: if we \r\ncontinue along the current path, we will not achieve \r\nthe objectives of the Paris Agreement. We do not \r\nknow exactly how much humankind contributes to \r\nglobal warming or to climate change, but we have the \r\nfacts, which, month after month, year after year, show \r\nwith certainty that we must act because we have a \r\nresponsibility to future generations. I can only welcome \r\nall initiatives to maintain or restore the momentum of \r\nthe Paris Agreement, including the Secretary-General’s \r\nproposal to convene another climate summit next year \r\non the sidelines of the General Assembly.\r\nManaging climate change is one of the most \r\nimportant goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda’s \r\n17 Sustainable Development Goals is progressing \r\nwell, and the international community is engaged, in \r\nparticular through national plans, keeping in mind that \r\neach Member State is free to focus on its own priorities. \r\nIt is clear that the issue of financing the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals remains a problem.\r\nWith regard to climate change, specific mechanisms \r\nhave been developed nationally and internationally \r\nand through the private sector. Mechanisms exist \r\nbut resources remain insufficient. Luxembourg now \r\nhas a green stock exchange with a capitalization of \r\n$50 billion — the largest of its kind. We also have a \r\ngoal to create similar mechanisms for other Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. However, the response of the \r\nfinancial sector remains lukewarm. That is because, \r\nfirst, traditional operators are unaware of the \r\npotential of new markets and, secondly, compliance \r\nobligations are imposed on supervisory authorities in \r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nAs we know, the share of official development \r\nassistance is decreasing, and other mechanisms must \r\nbe found to shore up the lack of resources, in particular \r\nfor the least developed countries. The need to diversify \r\nthe sources of development assistance cannot relieve \r\nus of our official development assistance obligations. \r\nFor its part, my country will continue to devote \r\n1 per cent of its gross national income to official \r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nLike the majority of countries, we experienced a \r\nrather challenging period in terms of budgetary matters. \r\nReducing the budget allocated to cooperation would \r\nhave been welcomed by some. I mention that simply \r\nbecause, in developed countries with considerable \r\nincome, we wonder if we should have a hot meal or a \r\ncold meal but, in some countries, mothers wonder if \r\nthey will be able to feed their children at all for the \r\nnext few days. We forget how lucky we are. I believe \r\nit is important to share what we have. I know that \r\nthere is consensus on that issue in my country. Even \r\nafter legislative elections in two weeks, I believe the \r\nconsensus will remain and that the next Government \r\nwill follow suit.\r\nThe effectiveness of development aid is of course not \r\nonly dependent on financial resources. In that regard, \r\nthe Secretary-General’s reform of the development \r\nsector has our full support. In particular, the policy \r\nand practice of United Nations development agencies \r\nshould be aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Coordination among agencies, the \r\ndevelopment of joint projects and the establishment of \r\na new resident coordinator system could give us the \r\nf lexibility and adaptability necessary for the effective \r\nimplementation of development projects on the ground.\r\nI highlighted the Secretary-General’s reforms \r\nbecause we believe that our country plays a special role \r\nin the area of development. However, reforms in the area \r\nof peace and security and within the management pillar \r\nof the Secretariat are important and should receive the \r\nsame strong support. Such efforts must succeed because \r\nthey also contribute to ensuring lasting support for \r\nmultilateral institutions. Reform in the area of peace \r\nand security should enable the deployment of United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations to be more effective \r\nand f lexible, while bearing in mind that deployment \r\nmodalities do not always meet needs.\r\nAfrica is one of the regions where the United Nations \r\nis most present through peacekeeping operations, \r\ndevelopment assistance and humanitarian programmes \r\nand projects. West Africa and the Sahel are now a \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n52/62 18-29877\r\nhotbed of instability, terrorism, organized crime and \r\ntrafficking of all kinds. Only through coordinated and \r\nconcerted action with regional and national stakeholders \r\nand international institutions can the burgeoning \r\nnumber of threats in the region be contained. For its \r\npart, my country focuses a considerable percentage \r\nof its development assistance on countries in that \r\nparticular region. By way of example, let me outline \r\nour efforts in Mali.\r\nOur programme for that country has a budget of \r\n€61 million for the period 2015-2019. Luxembourg \r\nis one of the main donors to the Office of the \r\nIndependent Observer, responsible for evaluating the \r\nimplementation of the ceasefire agreement between \r\nthe Government and armed groups in the north of the \r\ncountry. Since 2012, it has funded the establishment of \r\nthe International Commission of Inquiry for Mali to \r\ninvestigate violations of human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law. My country also contributes to the \r\ndevelopment of a compliance framework for respect for \r\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law to be \r\nused in operations of the Joint Force of the Group of \r\nFive for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel).\r\nWe allocate approximately €1.15 million to security \r\nand defence. Starting this year, my country has also been \r\nparticipating in the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and deploys \r\narmy officers to provide air support. In line with \r\ncommitments made during the Brussels conference in \r\nFebruary, Luxembourg will contribute approximately \r\n€500,000 in medical support to the G-5 Sahel Joint \r\nForce and €600,000 to build a field hospital in Sévaré. \r\nLuxembourg’s contribution clearly remains modest. I \r\nwould simply like to show what a small country like \r\nLuxembourg can contribute when international and \r\nregional coordination structures are put in place.\r\nThe situation in the Near and Middle East, as well \r\nas in the southern Mediterranean region of Libya, \r\ninspires less optimism. It must be highlighted that \r\nthe stalemate in the peace process between Israel and \r\nPalestine remains completely unresolved, and the \r\nsituation, it must be said, has deteriorated since the last \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We will never tire of \r\nrecalling the principles of international law that must \r\nform the basis for peace. There can be no doubt about \r\nIsrael’s right to exist or about the right of Palestinians \r\nto their own State. The two-State solution is the only \r\nfair and lasting solution.\r\nThe explosive situation in Libya is the result of \r\ntensions that are specific to Libya’s tribal structure. \r\nIt is also due to the fact that the country serves as a \r\nsounding board for tensions in the Sahel and Arab-\r\nMuslim worlds. The interest of the international \r\ncommunity, primarily the United Nations and its \r\nSpecial Envoy, is therefore multifaceted. The political \r\nsolution reached among the Libyan parties will also \r\ndetermine the control of migration f lows to Europe. It \r\nis obviously not a question of locking up the migrants \r\nin camps, in intolerable and disgraceful conditions of \r\nslavery, in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe war in Syria has led to a huge humanitarian \r\ncrisis. It has claimed the lives of countless people. \r\nHalf of the population is displaced, either internally \r\nor abroad. After the tragedy of eastern Ghouta at the \r\nbeginning of the year, more than 3 million people are \r\nnow threatened in the Idlib region. The means used in \r\nthe war by the warring parties have been extreme in \r\nterms of their violence and cruelty, including the use of \r\nchemical weapons, which is both beyond understanding \r\nand unacceptable.\r\nIt is simply incomprehensible and shameful that the \r\ninternational community has been unable, by means \r\nof veto, to renew an instrument designed to establish \r\nthe facts and responsibilities for the use of chemical \r\nweapons. We hope that the International, Impartial and \r\nIndependent Mechanism to assist in the Investigation \r\nand Prosecution of those Responsible for the Most \r\nSerious Crimes under International Law committed in \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011, established \r\nby resolution 71/248, will have access to data collected \r\nby the Joint Investigation Mechanism so that it can \r\nensure justice when the time comes.\r\nThe humanitarian commitment of my country in \r\nthe Syrian conflict is by far our most significant and \r\nstands at €7.5 million per year for the period 2016-2020, \r\nas I personally announced at the conference in London. \r\nLuxembourg will also participate in the latest appeal \r\nfor additional contributions from the Department \r\nof Political Affairs in support of the United Nations \r\npolitical efforts in Syria. It will also provide an amount \r\nof €200,000 to allow the Mechanism to be operational. \r\nThe tragedy of the war in Syria has led to a situation \r\nthat is all the more intractable, especially since it \r\ncombines the interplay of powers, regional rivalries and \r\nreligious conflict.\r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 53/62\r\nThe humanitarian tragedy in Yemen has caused \r\ndestruction, displacement, hunger and cholera. The \r\nwar raging there has also been extremely cruel. We \r\nmust expeditiously put in place the means to establish \r\naccountability and fight impunity. The role of the \r\nUnited Nations, in particular its Special Envoy and the \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, \r\nis crucial if we are to avoid further aggravating the \r\nsituation and to pave the way for a political solution.\r\nIn the two foregoing conflicts, the regional Powers \r\nplay an important, although not always positive, \r\nrole. That is the case for Iran. We share the concerns \r\nexpressed by the United States and its allies regarding \r\nIran’s influence in the Middle East, which is likely \r\nto destabilize the situation in many neighbouring \r\ncountries. From our point of view, however, that does \r\nnot mean that we should call into question Iran’s nuclear \r\ndeal, which we believe, if not perfect, provides tangible \r\nguarantees in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. \r\nWe regret that the United States has denounced that \r\nagreement, which was the subject of Security Council \r\nresolution 2231 (2015) and continues to bind the \r\ninternational community.\r\nWith regard to nuclear non-proliferation, we hope \r\nthat the process initiated between the United States and \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, with the \r\nsupport of South Korea, will lead to concrete results in \r\nthe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\r\nIn addition to the trend towards unilateralism \r\nand the reconsideration of the rule of law, we must \r\nunfortunately note a deterioration in the human rights \r\nsituation across the globe. That is true in conflict \r\nsituations, where the use of intimidation policies, \r\nethnic cleansing and widespread sexual violence is \r\nincreasingly common, particularly among non-State \r\nactors. It is also true due to the phenomenon whereby \r\nthe very existence of certain categories of human rights \r\nis denied and the legitimacy of certain human rights \r\ninstitutions is being called into question.\r\nThe situation of the Rohingya in Myanmar is \r\nemblematic of such a development. There is a tangle \r\nof ethnic cleansing, massacres, intimidation and rape, \r\nwith an entire population forced to f lee without much \r\nthat the international community can do, except to \r\norganize reception in a neighbouring territory and to \r\nsimply note the scale of the disaster. In that regard, \r\none of the positive developments is the fact that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) has been seized of \r\nthe situation because more than 700,000 refugees have \r\nbeen driven into Bangladesh, which is a State party to \r\nthe Rome Statute. We fully support the work of the ICC \r\non that issue, as well as in the other investigations that \r\nit conducts.\r\nWe do not accept that the legitimacy and the very \r\nexistence of the Court should be questioned on the \r\npretext of State sovereignty. In accordance with the \r\nprinciple of complementarity, the ICC intervenes only \r\nin the event of the failure of States to act.\r\nOur support to the Human Rights Council and its \r\nwork remains as strong as ever. We see the institution \r\nas a fundamental pillar of the United Nations system. \r\nThe Council can be reformed without challenging its \r\nmandate and modus operandi. We have supported \r\nefforts in that regard. However, we regret the decision \r\nof the United States to withdraw its participation from \r\nthe Human Rights Council, even though it was an ally \r\nin the defence of human rights at the global level. We \r\nhope that reform efforts will continue, and we will \r\nalso contribute to them from within, if Luxembourg is \r\nelected to the Council for the term 2022-2024.\r\nHuman rights cover many facets, such as civil \r\nand political rights and economic and social rights, \r\nto mention only the most traditional ones, but there is \r\nalso a new category of rights, including sexual rights \r\nand reproductive health rights. We regret that the latter \r\nare too often undermined not only in their principles \r\nbut also in their exercise, including through United \r\nNations programmes and projects aimed at giving \r\nwomen and girls control over their lives and access to \r\nfamily planning.\r\nIn that context, my country provides financial \r\nsupport to the programmes of the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) and UN-Women, as well \r\nas the Girls Not Brides initiative, in the amount of \r\n€600,000 and €400,000, respectively, for 2019. We also \r\nsupport a UNICEF-UNFPA project to eliminate genital \r\nmutilation, which stands at €400,000.\r\nThe United Nations gives legitimacy to \r\nmultilateralism and all other organizations and \r\ninstitutions that call for it. That is why we must tirelessly \r\ntake up that principle. Only then can we undertake the \r\nimportant work that lies ahead and face the challenges \r\nof globalization. A return to the private preserve of \r\nnationalism has never been an option for Luxembourg, \r\nand neither is it today for anybody — above all, the \r\ncountries in this Hall.\r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n54/62 18-29877\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Prime Minister, Minister of State, Minister for \r\nCommunications and Media and Minister for Worship \r\nof the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Xavier Bettel, Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nState, Minister for Communications and Media \r\nand Minister for Worship of the Grand Duchy of \r\nLuxembourg, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for General Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for General Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands.\r\nMr. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nGeneral Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Mark \r\nRutte, Prime Minister and Minister for General Affairs \r\nof the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Rutte (Netherlands): In 1999, in his message \r\nfor the New Millennium, the late Kofi Annan spoke \r\nwords that still ring true almost two decades later:\r\n“More than ever before in human history, we share \r\na common destiny. We can master it only if we face \r\nit together. And that, my friends, is why we have \r\nthe United Nations.”\r\nMr. Annan’s legacy is one of international cooperation, \r\nand of fighting illiteracy, poverty, inequality and \r\nclimate change as root causes of conflict and human \r\nrights violations. Above all, his is a legacy of hope, \r\nand a firm belief that progress is the unifying theme \r\nin human history. The Millennium Development Goals \r\nproved him right, and it is up to us, the leaders of the \r\nunited nations of the world, to carry this legacy forward \r\nand make the Sustainable Development Goals and the \r\nParis Agreement a reality.\r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands remains firmly \r\ncommitted to international cooperation. In fact, \r\nwe have enshrined the principle in Article 90 of our \r\nConstitution, which states that “the Government shall \r\npromote the development of the international legal \r\norder”. That provision reflects our moral compass, but \r\nit also reflects our history as an open, seafaring and \r\ntrading nation, and the fact that our Kingdom consists \r\nof four countries, in Europe and the Caribbean: Aruba, \r\nCuraçao, the Netherlands and Sint Maarten. We have \r\ntherefore understood for many centuries the necessity \r\nand benefits of a transnational outlook.\r\nThat is my core message today. We need a \r\ntransnational outlook to master the challenges we \r\nface. There is no conflict between multilateralism and \r\nnational interest, but rather the contrary. After all, \r\nwhat country does not benefit from a stable and secure \r\ninternational environment, free and fair world trade, \r\npeace instead of armed conflict, prosperity instead of \r\npoverty, and equality instead of inequality? And what \r\ncountry can achieve those goals alone?\r\nThose are rhetorical questions, of course, but once \r\nwe acknowledge that, and we should act in consequence, \r\nwhich means we must embrace multilateralism. To the \r\npeople of the Kingdom of the Netherlands this has only \r\nbecome more evident in the aftermath of the downing \r\nof Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. It remains an open \r\nwound for my country, and for all grieving nations \r\nthat had nationals on board. We are grateful for the \r\nsupport of the international community, as expressed in \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2166 (2014). We hope that \r\ntogether we will see justice done.\r\nIn May, the Joint Investigation Team presented \r\nconclusive evidence about the origin of the missile \r\nlauncher that was used to down the aircraft. This has \r\nonly bolstered our resolve that, in the interest of the \r\nvictims and their loved ones, the full truth must be \r\nrevealed, justice served and responsibility accepted. \r\nIn accordance with Security Council resolution 2166 \r\n(2014), we call on all States to fully cooperate with \r\nongoing efforts to this end.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the rules-based \r\nmultilateral order that arose after the Second World \r\nWar has brought great things to many people. That \r\ngoes especially for the United Nations and the General \r\nAssembly. And yet, for many other countries and \r\npeoples, the global order has not brought the same \r\nbenefits. In many parts of the world, peace, stability \r\nand prosperity cannot be taken for granted.\r\nThe multilateral system is therefore not perfect, \r\nand it is under pressure. The playing field is changing \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 55/62\r\nas we speak. Some countries, for a range of reasons, \r\nhave begun to embrace a different approach. Sadly, \r\nmore and more often, compromise is being rejected in \r\nfavour of polarization and perceived self-interest. We \r\nare witnessing a worrisome trend: some countries are \r\nshifting from a constructive to a combative approach \r\nin the multilateral environment. What is more, rising \r\nrepression, human rights violations and shrinking \r\nfreedom worldwide are a grave concern. Accountability \r\nis often lacking. And when the multilateral system \r\nbecomes paralysed, it is innocent people who suffer.\r\nSyria is a case in point. In his most recent \r\nannual report, Secretary-General Guterres wrote that \r\n“working together multilaterally is not optional; it is \r\nthe only answer” (A/73/1, para. 148). I fully agree. I \r\nbelieve in constructive multilateralism. I believe in \r\nthe power of principle, not the principle of power, to \r\nguide us towards a better future for more people. Our \r\nbest — perhaps even our only — way forward is not to \r\ngive in to defeatism and cynicism but to keep working \r\nto improve the system, step by step.\r\nIn that regard, let me emphasize once again that \r\nthe Kingdom of the Netherlands firmly supports the \r\nSecretary-General’s reform agenda and that we applaud \r\nits initial results. The recent agreement on United \r\nNations reform sends a strong message of broad support \r\nfor change. But, as always, the proof of the pudding is \r\nin the eating. Now we have to put words into action, \r\nand by “we” I mean the United Nations itself and all the \r\nMember States.\r\nThe United Nations system must be made fit for \r\npurpose to deliver on the 2030 Sustainable Development \r\nAgenda, which is the ultimate prevention agenda. \r\nTake, for example, the staggering number of 3,000 \r\nseparate United Nations offices around the world, \r\nwhich is 3,000 arguments that support those who say \r\nthat multilateralism just creates fragmentation and \r\nbureaucracy. The critics are not entirely wrong: United \r\nNations reform should bring down this number by at \r\nleast a thousand, through co-location, use of shared \r\npremises and services, and stronger collaboration. That \r\nis a thousand arguments for improving multilateralism, \r\nand that is just one example of the broader effort that \r\nis required to help the Secretary-General’s reform \r\ndrive succeed.\r\nAnother important initiative is the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Action for Peacekeeping agenda. \r\nPeacekeeping is at the heart of the United Nations, and \r\nwe need to keep that instrument up to date. Reforms \r\nwithin the Secretariat and in missions in the field, like \r\nthe introduction of rotation schemes, will help make \r\npeacekeeping missions more effective. For their part, \r\nMember States will have to match their words with \r\ndeeds and money. Supporting change is not a free lunch.\r\nThat is why, for example, the Kingdom of the \r\nNetherlands was the first Member State to announce \r\nfunding for a reformed resident coordinator system \r\nthat will raise the efficiency of the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system. It is why today I transferred \r\nthe intellectual property rights of the Dutch Travel \r\nInformation Portal to the United Nations. That system, \r\nwhich maps the travel movements of terrorists and \r\norganized crime syndicates, will now be accessible to \r\nall Member States. It is practical steps like those that \r\nimprove the United Nations, our United Nations.\r\nWhen we look at the United Nations institutions, \r\nwe must not mince our words. We must tell it like it is. \r\nSexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment \r\ncommitted by people working for United Nations \r\nmissions and organizations is unacceptable in every \r\ncase and in every place. There are no exceptions. That \r\nkind of misconduct undermines the core principles of \r\nthe United Nations and — as the Secretary-General \r\nhas rightly pointed out — zero tolerance is the only \r\npossible response. We must put the new policies in \r\nplace without hesitation and act on them. We must \r\nmake sure that victims feel heard and supported and \r\nthat whistle-blowers are protected. The United Nations \r\nis meant to save and improve lives, not destroy them. \r\nHere we must draw a clear line.\r\nOf course, improving the multilateral system is not \r\nonly about institutions and organizing principles. They \r\nare only a means to an end. Above all, it is about what we \r\ndo and why we do it. Over the years, we have gradually \r\nlearned that the only way to solve problems is to tackle \r\ntheir root causes. We have learned that systematically \r\nreducing poverty demands more than money alone, that \r\nending an armed conflict takes more than Blue Helmets \r\nalone, that gender equality and education are essential \r\nfor peace and development, and that sustainability, \r\nclimate resilience and international stability go hand in \r\nhand. The Sustainable Development Goals are built on \r\nthat concept of integrated thinking and action.\r\nThat brings me to a topic that is very important to \r\nme personally and to the Kingdom of the Netherlands: \r\nwater management and adaptation to climate change. \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n56/62 18-29877\r\nThe global water crisis affects us all, in the form of \r\nincreasing droughts, f loods or pollution. As a member \r\nof the former High-level Panel on Water, I hope that the \r\nagenda for water action we presented earlier this year \r\nwill inspire others to scale up their action on water. \r\nWe need to give the value of water greater weight in \r\nthe economic, social, environmental and other choices \r\nwe make.\r\nFor the Kingdom of the Netherlands, that is self-\r\nevident. Amsterdam airport is the only airport in the \r\nworld that lies below sea level — over four metres \r\nbelow sea level, in fact. So those present can imagine \r\nthat rising sea levels and the increase in extreme \r\nweather are of serious concern to us, as they are for the \r\nCaribbean parts of our Kingdom, which are especially \r\nvulnerable during the hurricane season.\r\nIt goes without saying that we welcome the recent \r\nannouncement of the new Global Commission on \r\nAdaptation. We are proud to be hosting the launch \r\nevent in my home town of The Hague on 16 October. Of \r\ncourse, we look forward to next year’s climate summit \r\nin New York because it should provide a platform to \r\ndelve deeper into the links among climate resilience, \r\nfinancing and security. Climate and water are, by their \r\nnature, issues that can be dealt with only multilaterally, \r\nusing an integrated approach. The Paris Agreement \r\nand Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 set clear \r\nobjectives. However, water cuts across all the SDGs. \r\nWhat we need now is international transparency, fair \r\nmarket mechanisms and a level playing field so that all \r\ncountries can do their part in adapting to climate change.\r\nDuring last year’s election of Netherlands United \r\nNations youth representatives, the young candidates \r\nwere asked what global issue they would address first \r\nif elected. Members of the Assembly might expect an \r\nanswer like world peace, eradicating poverty or ending \r\nwar. But one of them said:\r\n“I would tackle cynicism first. We can change \r\nthings, but we have to believe we can, roll up \r\nour sleeves and get started. Cynicism will get \r\nus nowhere.”\r\nWe all should take inspiration from those words. \r\nIt is easy to be cynical and criticize the multilateral \r\nsystem. It is harder to make improvements and reforms \r\nthat will take us forward, step by step. But constructive \r\nmultilateralism is the only way to make progress. That \r\nis what we are working for, and not only as a member \r\nof the Security Council until 31 December, but also \r\nafterwards and in other international forums. To that \r\nend, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will stand as a \r\ncandidate for the Human Rights Council for the 2020-\r\n2022 term. We will proceed in the spirit of Kofi Annan, \r\nwho once said that we need to keep hope alive and \r\nstrive to do better.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of the \r\nNetherlands for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nGeneral Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Ms. Erna Solberg, Prime Minister \r\nof Norway\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Norway.\r\nMs. Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of Norway, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Ms. Erna Solberg, Prime \r\nMinister of Norway, and inviting her to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMs. Solberg (Norway): In 1945, we established the \r\nUnited Nations. We pledged to save future generations \r\nfrom the scourge of war, to work together to promote \r\neconomic and social advancement, and to uphold and \r\nrespect human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. \r\nOur job is not done. Challenges remain, but progress \r\ncan and must be made.\r\nOur common global interests are also national \r\ninterests. We can achieve more when we act together. \r\nBoth our prosperity and many of our challenges are \r\nthe result of global trends. Trade conflicts, violent \r\nextremism, climate change and instability at the \r\nglobal level directly affect us at home, but so do also \r\nthe benefits of world trade, the global fight against \r\ninfectious diseases and the rule of law.\r\nThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals recognize \r\nthat global challenges are national challenges and that \r\nthey are closely interlinked. The Goals require us to \r\ntake both national and international action. We must \r\ndeal with the challenges of globalization, while at the \r\nsame time maximizing the benefits to our citizens. Our \r\njob as leaders is to deliver security, jobs, education and \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 57/62\r\nhealth care. Working together has enabled us all to do \r\nfar more than we could have done alone.\r\nNorway has taken national and international action \r\nthrough our national policy to promote sustainable \r\nlivelihoods, through our Nordic and European \r\npartnerships on economic and civic integration, and \r\nthrough global action to promote peace and security, \r\nthe sound management of the oceans, fair and regulated \r\ntrade, education for all and global health measures. \r\nTogether, we have achieved impressive results, because \r\ninternational cooperation works. Extreme poverty has \r\nbeen halved, people live longer, child mortality rates \r\nare falling and more girls attend school than ever \r\nbefore. Global political cooperation, global trade and \r\ninternational law have been crucial to that progress.\r\nWe have to recognize that globalization has not \r\nbeen equally beneficial to all. That is a very real \r\nchallenge. Exclusion can spur radicalization. It can \r\nundermine confidence in international institutions and \r\ncooperation. Eventually, it could weaken respect for \r\ninternational law, human rights and even our security \r\narchitecture. To counter that, we must secure the \r\nfuture welfare of a rapidly growing population. That \r\nrequires both the protection and reform of fundamental \r\ntrade norms. We cannot afford to let protectionism, \r\ndiscrimination and economic rivalry define our future. \r\nThe World Trade Organization is essential for Norway \r\nand our interaction with the world. I believe that rules-\r\nbased trade is just as important for our partners. Free \r\ntrade creates winners. Protectionism does not.\r\nIn order to benefit all, rights, rules and \r\nresponsibilities must be modernized to fit our current \r\nglobal economy. That is vital if we are to build a world \r\nwhere people’s potential, creativity and hopes for the \r\nfuture can be realized through cooperation, the exchange \r\nof knowledge and trade. Increased protectionism forces \r\nus to reflect on what less international cooperation \r\nwould entail.\r\nAs we agreed in 1945, all nations must unite in a \r\ncommitment to maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. The consequences of instability affect us \r\nall. Global security threats require global responses. \r\nThe Security Council must be able to act, and so must \r\nwe, as nations and as regional organizations. Areas of \r\nconflict and instability are breeding grounds for violent \r\nextremism and international terrorism.\r\nThe conflict in Syria is but one example. Many \r\ndifferent actors, State and non-State alike, are involved. \r\nBanned weapons of mass destruction have reappeared. \r\nHumanitarian access is obstructed. Respect for \r\nhuman rights and international law is undermined. \r\nOn my own continent, Europe, fundamental rules and \r\nprinciples of international law are now in jeopardy. \r\nUkraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within \r\ninternationally recognized borders must be restored. \r\nViolent extremism, conflict and instability lead to \r\nhumanitarian crises and violations of human rights. \r\nThose in turn are some of the main drivers of both \r\nregular and irregular migration. Terrorism and violent \r\nextremism affect us all and are not limited to any single \r\nideology, religion or belief.\r\nNorway is standing up against violent extremism \r\nand terrorism, not in response to individual incidents \r\nbut as a long-term foreign policy commitment. We \r\nare one of 79 members of the Global Coalition against \r\nthe Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. By working \r\ntogether, we have achieved significant results on the \r\nground. Still, in the continued fight against violent \r\nextremism, we must apply a whole-of-society approach. \r\nWe must address the root causes, in the Middle East and \r\nelsewhere, including in our own countries and on our \r\nown continents. We must bring individual perpetrators \r\nto justice and prevent impunity.\r\nNorway believes that those responsible for grave \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law must be \r\nheld accountable. We remain a staunch supporter of \r\nthe International Criminal Court as an independent \r\ninstitution. At the same time, security is closely linked \r\nto sustainable development. We must boost trade and \r\njob creation, build capacity for generating domestic \r\nrevenue, strengthen public service delivery and \r\ncombat corruption. Corruption fuels inequality, crime, \r\ninstability and violence.\r\nConflict can reverse years of social and economic \r\nprogress. Conflict prevention, peacekeeping and \r\ndisarmament are all vital if we are to achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. We should heed \r\nthe Secretary-General’s call for a surge in peace \r\ndiplomacy. Norway is doing its part. Since the end of \r\nthe Cold War, conflict mediation and resolution have \r\nbeen a cornerstone of our foreign policy. For more than \r\n25 years, we have been engaged in efforts to resolve \r\nconflicts around the world — from the first Oslo \r\nAccord in 1993, to the ongoing work in Colombia and \r\nthe Philippines, and back to the Middle East.\r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n58/62 18-29877\r\nWe have learned an important lesson from our \r\nefforts. Negotiating a peace agreement is always \r\ndifficult, but implementing the agreement is even \r\nharder. In fact, conflict recurrence is more common \r\nthan the onset of new conflicts. That means that the \r\nbest way to prevent conflict is to ensure that peace is \r\nsustainable. Norway remains committed in Colombia, \r\nthe Philippines and elsewhere, just as we remain \r\ncommitted to helping to achieve a negotiated two-State \r\nsolution between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, with the 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs), demonstrated the unique value of \r\nthe United Nations. We have agreed on a universal \r\ndevelopment agenda — a road map to the world we \r\nwant. The SDGs are closely interlinked. Achieving Goal \r\n16 on peace, the rule of law and strong institutions is \r\ncrucial to ensuring that funds are not lost to corruption, \r\nand achieving the SDGs related to economic conditions \r\nwill make funding available that can be used to make \r\nprogress on other Goals. But we have no time to lose. \r\nSustainable change cannot be brought about overnight. \r\nNational ownership is critical, but civil society, \r\nthe private sector, trade unions and the scientific \r\ncommunity all have a catalytic role to play.\r\nHealth is an area where it is easy to see that the \r\nSDGs apply to us all. Health is both a human right in \r\nitself and a prerequisite for development. Investing \r\nin national health systems is expensive, but failing to \r\ndo so can prove even more costly. The World Health \r\nOrganization is working to create a global action plan \r\nfor a simpler health architecture. That is a response to \r\nan initiative launched by Ghana, Germany and Norway. \r\nThe action plan will be presented in Berlin in October.\r\nPrevention saves lives, reduces human suffering \r\nand enhances economic and social development. \r\nNorway is proud to be hosting the first replenishment \r\nconference of the Global Financing Facility in Oslo on \r\n6 November, and will contribute substantially. Progress \r\non one SDG will stimulate progress on others. For \r\nexample, child mortality rates fall when mothers have \r\nan education.\r\nHowever, there are still more boys than girls who \r\nget an education. We have to put girls at the centre \r\nof our education efforts. But just going to school \r\nis not enough. That is why Norway has focused on \r\nteaching quality and learning outcomes. Ensuring \r\nquality education requires continued international \r\nfinancing, and the financing gap is considerable. It is \r\ntherefore important to mobilize domestic resources \r\nand private funding, alongside official development \r\nassistance. Norway is doing its part. So far this year, \r\nwe have allocated approximately $440 million to global \r\neducation, and we will now increase our support to \r\neducation efforts targeting girls, to nearly $40 million \r\nfor the period 2018-2019.\r\nClean and healthy oceans that are sustainably \r\nharvested are a prerequisite for reaching the SDGs. \r\nFifty per cent of the world’s oxygen comes from the \r\noceans. Thirty per cent of the world’s carbon dioxide \r\nemissions are absorbed by the oceans. Our oceans \r\noffer us enormous renewable resources and represent a \r\nsource of great promise and economic potential. Almost \r\nhalf of the world’s population already depends on the \r\noceans for nutrition and employment, but in order to \r\nensure a sustainable ocean economy, we must produce \r\nmore from the oceans.\r\nHowever, the sustainability of our oceans is \r\nthreatened. By 2050, they could contain more plastic \r\nthan fish. Marine litter is one of the fastest growing \r\nenvironmental concerns. Since I started speaking, a \r\nfurther 200 tons of plastic have ended up in the sea. \r\nThe United Nations Environment Assembly has taken \r\na bold step and adopted a vision of zero discharge of \r\nplastic litter into the ocean. Now we must translate that \r\ninto action. Managing our oceans sustainably is crucial. \r\nIncreased global funding is imperative and Norway \r\nwill dig deep to contribute. We have no time to lose.\r\nThat is why, earlier this week, I established the \r\nHigh-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, \r\nmade up of Heads of State and Government from \r\nall continents. We aim to promote science-based \r\ndecision-making in the fields of ocean economy and \r\nocean management. We will cooperate closely with the \r\nUnited Nations Special Envoy for the Ocean and other \r\nocean initiatives. We aim to present our report in 2020.\r\nFor seven decades, Norway has been a consistent \r\nsupporter of the United Nations and the rules-based \r\nmultilateral order. We are one of the largest financial \r\ncontributors to the United Nations. We consistently \r\nallocate 1 per cent of our gross national income \r\nto development aid. There is broad support for the \r\nUnited Nations and for our engagement in sustainable \r\ndevelopment and peace across the political spectrum.\r\nIn 2021 it will have been 20 years since Norway \r\npreviously held a seat on the Security Council. We \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 59/62\r\nare ready to serve again. If we are elected, we will \r\nwork to make the Security Council more transparent, \r\nefficient and representative. We will work with other \r\nMember States, regardless of their size, wealth or \r\ngeographical location, to find common solutions. We \r\nwill draw on our experience in peace and reconciliation \r\nprocesses. As women’s rights and participation are \r\ncrucial to lasting peace and stability, we will keep \r\nthat issue high on our agenda. Together with partners \r\nfrom many regions, Norway will support initiatives for \r\nsustainable oceans and forests. We will highlight the \r\nconsequences of climate change and the links between \r\nsecurity and sustainable development. We will promote \r\nreform of the Council to make it more transparent, \r\nrepresentative and better equipped to deal with current \r\nglobal realities. Norway will continue to be a consistent \r\npartner of the United Nations. We will continue to seek \r\ncommon solutions to the challenges that we face in our \r\nshared future.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nNorway for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of Norway, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nSeveral representatives have asked to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind them that \r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): We have asked for the \r\nf loor to respond to the statement made yesterday in \r\nthe general debate by the Prime Minister of Armenia \r\n(see A/73/PV.7). The initial impression was that the \r\nspeaker — while still under the influence of what he \r\ncalled the Velvet Revolution and driven by populist and \r\nhighly contradictory rhetoric — confused the General \r\nAssembly with the streets of Gyumri and Yerevan. While \r\nthe Prime Minister of Armenia was not fastidious in \r\nhis choice of words in blaming the ousted Government \r\nof his country for authoritarian rule, corruption and \r\nthe suppression of democracy and human rights, his \r\ncomments about the ongoing conflict between Armenia \r\nand Azerbaijan differed little from the phraseology that \r\nhas been stubbornly used by his predecessors in the \r\npast. As a consequence, the statement of the Armenian \r\nPrime Minister was yet another useless attempt to deny \r\nthe facts and responsibility for unleashing the war \r\nagainst Azerbaijan and its devastating consequences.\r\nIt is well known that Armenia used military force to \r\nseize part of the territory of Azerbaijan, including the \r\nNagorno Karabakh region, the seven adjacent districts \r\nand some exclaves, and to set up the subordinate racist \r\nminority regime there. The war waged by Armenia \r\nclaimed the lives of tens of thousands of people, ruined \r\ncities, towns and villages, and resulted in the forcible \r\nexpulsion of more than 1 million Azerbaijanis from their \r\nhomes and property, while thousands of people went \r\nmissing in connection with the conflict. The claims \r\nand misinterpretations that we heard in the statement \r\ndelivered by the Armenian Prime Minister were \r\nparticularly astonishing given that they were expressed \r\nin the United Nations, whose Security Council adopted \r\nfour resolutions condemning the use of force against \r\nAzerbaijan and the bombardment and occupation of its \r\nterritories, while reaffirming respect for the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of my country, the inviolability \r\nof international borders and the inadmissibility of the \r\nuse of force for the acquisition of territory.\r\nFurthermore, in response to Armenia’s territorial \r\nclaims and forcible actions, the Council has reconfirmed \r\nthat the Nagorno Karabakh region is an integral part \r\nof Azerbaijan and demanded the immediate, complete \r\nand unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces \r\nfrom all the occupied territories. In other words, in its \r\nresolutions the Security Council has acknowledged the \r\nfact that acts of military force have been committed \r\nagainst Azerbaijan and that such acts are unlawful and \r\nincompatible with the prohibition of the use of armed \r\nforce in international relations, and in contradiction \r\nto the Charter of the United Nations and its purposes, \r\nand that they constitute an obvious violation of the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan.\r\nIt was no surprise that, in his speech, the Prime \r\nMinister of Armenia deliberately passed over the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolution in silence. Likewise, he also \r\nomitted any mention of other important international \r\ndocuments adopted in connection with the conflict. \r\nThe declared commitments and deeds of Armenia have \r\nalways been at odds with the objective of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of the conflict. The statement of the Prime \r\nMinister of Armenia was no exception. In reality, in \r\nhaving used military force to occupy the territory \r\nof a sovereign State, Armenia has demonstrated its \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n60/62 18-29877\r\nfirm conviction in the existence of an alternative to a \r\npolitical solution.\r\nAllegations concerning a new mythical genocidal \r\nthreat against the Armenian people represent another \r\nfalsehood. Suffice it to say that, unlike Armenia, which \r\nhas implemented a policy of total ethnic cleansing of \r\nall non-Armenians from both its own territory and the \r\noccupied areas of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan has preserved \r\nits ethnic and cultural diversity to the present day and \r\nis home to tens of thousands of Armenians living in \r\npeace, harmony and dignity in the capital city of \r\nBaku and other parts of the country. All statements \r\nby the Armenian leadership about democracy, human \r\nrights and the peaceful settlement of the conflict are \r\npreposterous and will remain mere words unless they \r\nare translated into real action that would end the \r\noccupation of the territories of Azerbaijan and ensure \r\nthe return of forcibly displaced Azerbaijanis to their \r\nhomes and property in the Nagorno Karabakh region \r\nand other occupied districts of Azerbaijan in safety \r\nand dignity. The achievement of that objective, which \r\nis imperative and not subject to compromise, will \r\ncreate the necessary conditions for addressing other \r\nissues with the direct, equal and full participation of \r\nboth communities concerning the Nagorno Karabakh \r\nregion within the Constitutional and legal framework \r\nof Azerbaijan.\r\nArmenia’s policy of annexation and colonization \r\nhas no chance of succeeding. The Nagorno Karabakh \r\nregion has always been and will remain and inseparable \r\npart of Azerbaijan. The military occupation of the \r\nterritories of Azerbaijan is temporary and will never \r\nproduce the political outcome desired by Armenia. \r\nYerevan must cease its futile attempts to mislead its \r\nown people and the international community, engage \r\nconstructively in the conflict-settlement process and \r\ncomply with its international obligations.\r\nMr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): It was not my intention \r\nto take the f loor. However, I am forced to use my right \r\nof reply to respond to the accusations that were aired \r\njust now in the General Assembly.\r\nFirst and foremost, I would like to put everything \r\nfrankly and note that there is no conflict between \r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan. The conflict is between the \r\nNagorno Karabakh Republic, also known by its new \r\nname — the Republic of Artsakh — and the Republic \r\nof Azerbaijan. I would like to remind the Assembly, but \r\nespecially our Azerbaijani colleagues, as I am really \r\nsurprised by their logic in turning the truth upside \r\ndown. Let me remind them of a few important phases \r\nof history.\r\nThe first attacks on the peaceful population of \r\nNagorno Karabakh were carried out by the authorities \r\nof Azerbaijan. The attacks were afterwards turned into \r\na full-scale war against the population of Artsakh. \r\nAzerbaijan used heavy artillery, tanks and every \r\npossible weapon they could to destroy and annihilate \r\nthe population of Nagorno Karabakh. Luckily, and not \r\nsurprisingly, they lost. Nagorno Karabakh won that war \r\nand, in order to secure its right to life, it had to fight. \r\nIt fought and won. Moreover, on 10 December 1991, \r\nNagorno Karabakh declared, through a referendum, \r\nits independence from Azerbaijan in the same way in \r\nwhich Azerbaijan declared its independence from the \r\nformer Soviet Union.\r\nThe Azerbaijan representative mentioned the racist \r\naccusations levelled at the Armenian authorities, but let \r\nme recall the racist accusations made by the Azerbaijani \r\nleadership, including the President, who has always \r\nsaid that every Armenian in the world is an enemy of \r\nAzerbaijan. They are changing the situation by turning \r\nthemselves into victims and putting the entire blame \r\non Armenia, Armenians or anything Armenian in \r\nthe world.\r\nLet us look at the current military preparations of \r\nAzerbaijan. The constant shelling on the border with \r\nArmenia and the ceaseless shelling and sniper fire on \r\nthe Nagorno Karabakh contact line are showing the \r\ntrue face of Azerbaijan. Nagorno Karabakh has never \r\nbeen and will never be part of Azerbaijan. It is an \r\nindependent republic with a full-f ledged Government \r\nand many more democratic institutions than Azerbaijan. \r\nAzerbaijan should reacquaint itself with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and remember that the aggressor, \r\nfirst and foremost, is Azerbaijan. The whole thing \r\nbegan as a result of Azerbaijan’s aggression against the \r\npeople of Nagorno Karabakh.\r\nConcerning the myth of genocide, it began not only \r\nwith the massacres of every Armenian person living \r\nin Sumgait, Baku and Kirovabad 20 to 30 years ago, \r\nbut were also carried out in the early years of Soviet \r\npower in Azerbaijan, when Armenians were killed in \r\nBaku and attacked in Shushi. There is a real threat to \r\nthe people living in Nagorno Karabakh. That is why \r\nno Armenian or any other ethnic minority, for that \r\n26/09/2018 A/73/PV.9\r\n18-29877 61/62\r\nmatter, would be willing to live under the occupation \r\nof Azerbaijan.\r\nEverything said by the Azerbaijan representative \r\nis false. Let me address, at least, one particular issue. \r\nThe assertion that tens of thousands of Armenians are \r\nliving in Azerbaijan is false. The European Commission \r\nagainst Racism and Intolerance, established by the \r\nCouncil of Europe, has reported on numerous occasions, \r\nbased on its visits with and studies of the Azerbaijani \r\npopulation, that, at most, 20 to 30 Armenian people \r\ncurrently live in Azerbaijan in mixed marriages. The \r\nwords of the representatives of Azerbaijan — whether \r\nin this Hall or in Baku — never correspond to the \r\nrealities on the ground. Whatever is said is based on \r\nlies and wishful thinking.\r\nIt is most important not to deliberate those issues \r\nhere and invoke various stories that, as I mentioned, \r\nhave been fabricated, but to stick to the peace process. \r\nIt will be very important for the Azerbaijani side to \r\nbe sincerely engaged in the peace process. The only \r\nmandated peace process, which is also mandated \r\nby the United Nations and the Secretary-General, \r\nis the co-chairmanship of the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and the Minsk \r\nGroup. Negotiations have been conducted within that \r\nframework for many years, and they have yielded many \r\nresults, but in order to achieve final results, we need the \r\nsincere participation of Azerbaijan, while forgetting \r\nany possible military solution and being sincerely \r\nactive in peaceful negotiations.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): The unfortunate \r\ncomments just made by the representative of \r\nArmenia, which were full of the usual distortions and \r\nfalsifications, are illustrative of the consistent attempts \r\nof that Member State to deny the facts that point to its \r\npolicy of aggression, hostility, hatred and falsifications. \r\nIt was precisely the Armenian armed attacks on areas \r\nwithin Azerbaijan that led to the series of four Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and relevant presidential statements. \r\nThe demand for the cessation of hostilities was first \r\nand foremost directed at the invading Armenian forces. \r\nIt was Armenia that intentionally disregarded the \r\ndemands of the Security Council for the immediate \r\ncessation of all military activities and hostile acts for \r\nthe purpose of establishing a stable ceasefire.\r\nThe events that unfolded prior to and in the \r\naftermath of the adoption of each resolution make it \r\nclear that Armenia’s allegations are baseless and leave \r\nno doubt as to who was responsible for the continued \r\narmed hostilities and to whom the demands of the \r\nSecurity Council were exclusively addressed. Clearly, \r\nthe claims of Armenia run counter to the norms of \r\ninternational law and are without foundation. It is \r\nwell known that the Nagorno Karabakh region and the \r\nseven surrounding districts of Azerbaijan are under \r\nArmenian military occupation. Indeed, Armenia used \r\nmilitary force to occupy the territory of Azerbaijan and \r\nestablish a subordinate regime on it. That regime is \r\nentirely unrecognized as such. It is under the direction \r\nand control of Armenia and is ultimately nothing other \r\nthan the product of aggression, racial discrimination \r\nand ethnic cleansing. Consequently, the illegality \r\nof that regime and its structures has been repeatedly \r\nconfirmed at the international level.\r\nArmenia’s policy of aggression and territorial \r\nclaims are not only a threat to peace and security, but \r\nalso are one of the main causes of the deep political \r\ncrisis and the dire economic situation in that country. \r\nThe international community would undoubtedly be \r\ninterested in hearing from the delegation of Armenia \r\nabout the real problems that the country is facing in \r\nthe socioeconomic sphere, including a significant dip \r\nin major sectors of the economy in recent years and a \r\nhigh rate of migration of its citizens from the country.\r\nHowever, neither the Prime Minister or the \r\nrepresentative of Armenia mentioned in their statements \r\nany efforts the Government is taking to address those \r\nchallenges and implement the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. They prefer to keep silent on that simply because \r\nthey have nothing to say. We have repeatedly stated \r\nthis before, and I would like to stress once again, the \r\nsooner the Government of Armenia realizes the lack \r\nof any prospect of success for its dangerous political \r\nagenda, the sooner the conflict will be resolved and \r\nall countries and peoples will be able to benefit from \r\npeace, stability and cooperation.\r\nMr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): Basically, I need only \r\nrecall any newspaper or any media outlet of 30 years \r\nago, when every detailed description was presented \r\nconcerning developments in the massacre of the \r\nArmenian population in Azerbaijan, including the detail \r\nof who attacked whom first, how things started and the \r\nsource of the conflict. As I said, it is most important that \r\npeople read the newspapers of 30 years ago, not today’s \r\nnewspapers because today’s Azerbaijani newspapers are \r\nmerely lying about everything that happened 30 years \r\nago. Unfortunately, there is not a single person, human \r\nA/73/PV.9 26/09/2018\r\n62/62 18-29877\r\nrights activist, human rights defender or independent \r\njournalist who will be able to speak freely or accurately \r\nin Azerbaijan because everyone who speaks accurately \r\nis behind bars these days.\r\nThe Security Council requested that Armenia use \r\nits influence to stop the hostilities, which it did, and \r\nthe hostilities were stopped on 4 May 1994, when the \r\nAzerbaijani Government itself was willing to sign \r\na ceasefire agreement with the de facto authorities \r\nof the Nagorno Karabakh Republic. Armenia was a \r\nco-signer of that document, and the other main parties \r\nwere, as I said, Azerbaijan and the Nagorno Karabakh \r\nRepublic authorities.\r\nIt is awful to see what is currently happening \r\nin Azerbaijan. Because the authorities of Nagorno \r\nKarabakh are very open and sincere in their democratic \r\nvalues, anyone from any country of the world visiting \r\nthe Nagorno Karabakh Republic — whether for tourism \r\nor official business — is blacklisted by the Azerbaijani \r\nauthorities, who limit their freedom to travel and \r\nfreedom of movement. I should also add that the \r\nNagorno Karabakh authorities are fully and unilaterally \r\nabiding by the United Nations rules. The Nagorno \r\nKarabakh authorities have unilaterally ratified all of the \r\nimportant United Nations conventions, including the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, the Covenant on \r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, and many other \r\nimportant documents. In addition, Nagorno Karabakh \r\nwill soon present its voluntary national review for the \r\nhigh-level political forum of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil on its progress with regard to the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe threat to security in the region is coming from \r\na single source — Azerbaijan. That threat is further \r\nexacerbated by the fact that at least 1,000 Azerbaijani \r\ncitizens have been fighting in the so-called Azerbaijani \r\nBrigade of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, \r\nwho occasionally have appeared on the border with \r\nArmenia; who declared that they would leave Raqqa \r\nto fight against Nagorno Karabakh during the April \r\n2016 war, which was unleashed by Azerbaijan against \r\nthe peaceful population of Nagorno Karabakh; and \r\nwho luckily, not surprisingly and very logically lost \r\nonce again.\r\nIn conclusion, and most important, as I said, peace \r\nnegotiations are carried out within the framework of \r\nthe co-chairmanship of the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe and the Minsk Group. The \r\nmain principles that have been put forward are the \r\nfollowing: the non-use of force or threat of the use of \r\nforce, territorial integrity and the equal rights and self-\r\ndetermination of people. Unfortunately, Azerbaijan \r\nalways forgets about self-determination and puts \r\nits territorial integrity first. I recall that any future \r\nsolution to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict has to be \r\nfound within the framework of negotiations, based on \r\nthose three most important principles.\r\nThe meeting rose at 10.35 p.m.\r\n"
